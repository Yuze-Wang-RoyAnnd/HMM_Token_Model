the late dudley moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981's arthur, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood. moore received a best actor oscar nomination for his performance as arthur bach, a drunken playboy who "races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own boss." arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named susan johnston (jill eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. things get sticky when arthur meets linda morolla (liza minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. the late sir john gielgud won a best supporting actor oscar for his flawless turn as arthur's acid-tongued butler and best friend, hobson, whose outward disdain for arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. there are other funny contributions by barney martin as linda's father. stephen elliott as susan's father, and geraldine fitzgerald as arthur's demented grandmother. the film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named steve gordon, who, sadly, died the following the year. there was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.
