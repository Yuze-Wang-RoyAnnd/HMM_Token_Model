great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like pitt's character interviewing the president,or pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to us.scenes like those would have kept the audience awake.cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like those.the dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watching.also,big fans of fising,early 20th century styles and montana will really like this as well........
