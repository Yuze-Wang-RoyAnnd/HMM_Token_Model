i have seen this movie and even though i kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning i still liked watching it. i would recommend it to other people. it comes on lifetime movie network quite a lot. and i am thinking since it's close to halloween they might play it more. so please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it. i believe that alicia silverstone played her part very well. i really like her as an actress and person. she seems so nice and down to earth. kevin dillon he's performance was so so for me. i am not trying to knock him or anything but i believe that his brother matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better. kevin just seems too sweet for me. but i think he did okay.
