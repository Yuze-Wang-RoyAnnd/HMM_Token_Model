woody allen's second movie set in london. tha tarot card murderer is killing prostitutes in london. aspiring journalist sondra pransky (scarlett johansson) gets a tip that he may be lord peter lyman (hugh jackman). she starts to romance him but quickly falls in love. she's helped by stage magician sid waterman (woody allen) who doesn't like what he sees.<br /><br />i like this better than the over rated "match point" from last year. it was shorter and moved much more quickly. the plot is old but i was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end. it's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines (all from allen of course). it's not one of allen's best but it's far better than his worst.<br /><br />the acting is, for the most part, very good. allen is bad but he's played this character a million times before and it's gotten tiresome. but johansson and jackman are just great--they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances. also allen (surprisingly) works on their sex appeal--there is a sequence where they're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies. the only real debit is that allen still seems unsure on how to shot london. he's not as off as he was on "match point" though--maybe he'll just get better as he goes along.<br /><br />worth seeing. i give it an 8.
