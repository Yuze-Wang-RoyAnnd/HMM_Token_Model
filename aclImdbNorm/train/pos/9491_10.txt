henri verneuil's film may be not so famous as parallax view, 3 days of the condor or jfk but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre. action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed. after several years of investigation, special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman. but one man - prosecutor volney, played by yves montand - thinks there's something more to be investigated and so the film starts. this movie doesn't deal with some exact theories, but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today's world. such film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose it's actuality. furthermore, it's even a bit frightful how precise are it's oracles. 10 out of 10.
