just after the end of wwii powell & pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the uk & the usa. at the time there was a lot of "overpaid, over sexed and over here" type of comments. somehow they came up with this masterpiece.<br /><br />my favourite movie of all time. it's got everything. romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very quirky.<br /><br />i can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right buttons and although i've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) i'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout.<br /><br />was it the magnificent acting, the wonderful sets, the inspired script ? who knows. but *do* watch it and you'll see what i mean.
