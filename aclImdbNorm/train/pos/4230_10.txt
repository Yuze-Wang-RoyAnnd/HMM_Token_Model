for columbo fans, such as myself, this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why columbo was so popular, and just how good it really was. ruth gordon has a field day (as ever) playing the wittily intelligent crime novelist abigail mitchell. seems abigail calls her nephew-in-law to sign some papers making him her heir. she never got over her niece's death, and is convinced her dead niece's husband (charles frank) did the dirty deed. to tell more would be unthinkable. mariette hartley has a sly role as abigail's personal assistant. this episode of columbo is in a class by itself. it's a truly well made television movie. i recommend it most highly.
