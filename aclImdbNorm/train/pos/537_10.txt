to me a matter of life and death is just that- simply the best film ever made.<br /><br />from beginning to end it oozes class. it is stimulating, thought provoking, a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples.<br /><br />the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly. the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy.<br /><br />no matter how many times i watch the film - and i have watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me. it makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. it is as fresh today as it was in 1946.<br /><br />if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film.
