the dirty harry series began with very gritty cop action, and was almost immediately lightened up for "magnum force". by the time that "the enforcer" rolled around, dirty harry was little more than a television cop show (saved only by tyne daly). after a break of seven years, dirty harry has finally gone back to his roots. maybe he's been gone for too long this time.<br /><br />clint eastwood makes the first well-directed harry film since don siegel made the first, which helps considerably. harry is a darker character once again, not the nice cop he had become. he can once again say things like "go ahead, make my day" and really mean it. "sudden impact" is a true dirty harry sequel. "the enforcer" should never have been made.<br /><br />7.2 out of 10
