i have, "things to come," on d.v.d. and it's very clear compared to my vhs version. the audio is fair, but can be hard to understand at times. <br /><br />i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found it.it gave details of why some things happened. the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn't notice at first. such as, john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party, like it was a dive bomber, out dateing sea power by naming a battleship,"dinosuar." ships sunk by air-power, an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes. swept flying wing planes. strong rolls for the women through the entire movie. <br /><br />there are more, see the movie to enjoy them.
