the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march. a very good film indeed. hollywood's love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner. he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies. charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius. however, the movie did tend to get a little long in places. it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version. still, it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once.
