this movie is an awesome non-stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a dawid dhawan comedy - bumbling heroes , buffoonish supporting characters , made-up dolls for heroines , nasty villains , wisecracks , rocking soundtrack + choreography and a little dose of action . <br /><br />amitabh bachchan and govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen . the heroine of amitabh the cop is ramya krishnan and raveena is opposite govinda the cop . heroines are mere rouge-smothered props as usual . the conmen have no heroines . paresh rawal carries his villainous act in daud forward (he played a similar don in khoobsurat too) . asrani shines in a brief role . he does a retake on his famous "angrezon ke zamaane ke jailer" act in sholay .<br /><br />govinda is impeccable as usual - as a wisecracking , good-humoured policeman pyaare mohan and as a conman chhote miyaan . he imitates bihari style of hindi speaking with hilarious results . amitabh bachchan , believe it or not , pales in comparison with him . but still ab is fine . madhuri dixit does a cameo as herself in the song "makhna" . she dances like wind . <br /><br />viju shah's music is awesome . check out "kisi disco mein jaayen" , "makhna" and the title track .<br /><br />do not go looking for any logic since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of convenience completely . just enjoy yourself .
