i love this movie, jouvet, arletty, blier, carn'e... almost everything has already been said about the movie, but there is one detail i'd like to shed some light onto: no footage of the real, still standing, h^otel du nord (is it still? i heard it was to be demolished...) has been used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt on set, the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks.
