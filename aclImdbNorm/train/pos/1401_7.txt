okay, we've got extreme verhoeven violence (although not as extreme as other verhoeven flicks), we've got plenty of sex and nudity, but something is missing...oh, yes, it's missing the intelligence that paul verhoeven is known for in his sci-fi movies. i admire the way verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most verhoeven films, the movie itself doesn't have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre. the acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films.<br /><br />what makes hollow man a good movie is not the story, not the cast or characters, but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible. the crew has truly made an invisible man, without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects done on set). the most stunning effects scenes are not seen while kevin bacon is invisible, they are when kevin bacon is becoming invisible and visible.<br /><br />the problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive. here, it takes place at a lab for the most part. i would have enjoyed seeing the invisible kevin bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it, or let's say steal something from people's purses, or something like that. but what is shown is decent enough to make hollow man an entertaining movie. grade: b
