my super ex girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, i was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? it was! but this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of. i know that this was a very cheesy movie, but uma and anna were just so cool and steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that's what made the movie really work.<br /><br />jenny johnson(scary, that's my best friend's actual name) is not your typical average librarian looking woman, when matt, your average male, asks her out, he's in for more than he expected, he's asked g-girl out on a date, the super hero of the world! but when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time apart, but jenny won't have it since he's fallen for another girl, hannah, and she will make his life a living hell, i mean, let's face it, he couldn't have chosen a better girl to break up with.<br /><br />the effect were corny, but you seriously move past them quickly, the story and cast made the story really work and i loved uma in this movie, it was such a step up from prime. my super ex girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't really take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy that i think if i could get a laugh out of it, anyone could.<br /><br />7/10
