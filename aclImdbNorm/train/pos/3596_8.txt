i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through, and i must say, i was very impressed. michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses---it's not only the fact that she *can* act, but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem. i've read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand, but i certainly disagree. diana is a feminist. she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks (with the exception of her caring brother tiny and her trainer and manager, hector, who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent), which is what the word "feminism" is all about. it's good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminism--that they're not a bunch of manhating losers--but that they have dreams and can do anything. diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love, and she and adrian have a more realistic, complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out. girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people. thanks, michelle.<br /><br />8/10 - a very important movie that's relatable to not just young women, but everyone wanting to go far in their lives.
