i remember watching this film, thinking was so interesting. i really wanted to know what happens next. i was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short. we start in a school yard. . two friends are debating on skipping class. kid b says to kid a "lets not go to class today." and kid a declines, claiming they could miss something really important. so kid b skips and kid a goes to class. when he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. they were going to learn the meaning of life. she gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid a, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. well, the kid won't share, so kid a goes looking for the teacher. when he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is. i suggest everyone watch this short. it will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important, it could help you for a life time.
