years ago, i found a "bargain bin" copy of this film for a buck or two. in so many ways, this is quite fitting, as when it was made back in 1933, it was truly a cheaply made film by the "poverty row" studio, majestic. however, while the film is rather derivative, it is still well worth watching and provides a few surprises.<br /><br />the story is very, very familiar, as in some germanic town, the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires! adding to this familiarity is dwight frye. he played renfield in dracula, and here he is very, very similar--though he plays a much more harmless weirdo. in this case, he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths. the film does a good job of providing some "red herrings" (i.e., false leads) and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out frye may not be responsible, the who and why are intriguing and make it very different from the average horror film. in addition, while the production had little money to speak of, it still had some good actors of the day--lionel atwill and melvin douglas--and it also used universal studios sets at night (when they were done filming for the day). as a result, the film looks pretty good overall, though i also thought that, as usual, fay wray was terrible--thought it didn't noticeably detract from the film. i have seen her in more movies than most people on imdb and i have come to notice that her characters have no depth--she always seems to be cast as the "screaming lady" and provides little new in each film.<br /><br />overall, for fans of old horror films, this is excellent and worth seeing. for people who are not fans of the genre, it's probably pretty skip-able.
