another reason to watch this delightful movie is florence rice. florence who? that was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. i soon found out who florence rice was, a real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance. as they all do in this gripping ensemble piece. from 1939, its a different time but therein lies the charm. it transports you into another world. it starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. florence rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. she is absolutely delightful, at the same time strong, vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman.watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. she made over forty movies, and i am going to seek out the other thirty nine. alan marshal is of the flynn/gable mode and proves a perfect match for florence. buddy ebsen and una merkel provide some excellent comic moments, but the real star is florence rice. fans of 30's/40's movies, don't miss this one!
