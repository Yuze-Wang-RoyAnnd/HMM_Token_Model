this movie scared the crap out of me! i have to admit that i spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what i saw was really scary. i screamed out loud two or three times during the show.<br /><br />film-making-wise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography. the sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful. i read somewhere that it's some weird husband and wife team that made it. for some reason that makes this even stranger for me. <br /><br />if you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you! very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls!
