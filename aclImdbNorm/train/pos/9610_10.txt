i cried my heart out, watching this movie. i have never suffered from any eating disorder, but i think this must be a very true picture.<br /><br />alison lohman is excellent! she expresses these feelings amazingly well. my teenage years came back to me so vividly. anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this movie. i recommend you all to see it!<br /><br />the music is great too - i've now discovered diana lorden.<br /><br />i'm also looking forward to seeing alison lohman in white ol'eander, because i am positive she is perfectly suited for the role as agnes.
