i want to add to the praise for the production of this film, especially the luminous cinematography. firelight glistening off of smooth and muscled skin creates stunningly beautiful imagery. the film was nominated for (and won) a single oscar - the first given for editing. mala's performance is moody, penetrating and powerful.
