i'm from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor, sorry for that...<br /><br />this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air. i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title, i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent.<br /><br />i must admit that it's a very well put together movie and that's why i'm puzzled. this is the only film made by this director...? how come he didn't make lots of films after this rather good one...? someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /><br />anyway, i really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one, please.....?
