this is a very strange film by director/animator richard williams. all who know of william's work know it's a bit off-kilter (if not ingenious) but this one takes the cake.<br /><br />it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way. the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality; its strange character designs, its powerful animation, and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary. williams' brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls, floppy and darned, rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls, which made it more believable (at least in a visual sense). the animation shines on the bring us the camel-with-the-wrinkled-knees, whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end, the silent-movie chase with sir leonard looney and, of course, the greedy.<br /><br />the greedy animation, on its own, is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation i've ever seen. there's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop--and every second it's something new. living in what was deemed "the taffy pit," the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets. he sings a song that i can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones, then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heart.<br /><br />the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs. it continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are sixteen of them. there are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones) including "i look, and what do i see?", "no girl's toy", "blue" (though they didn't need to make him sing it twice), "i never get enough", "because i love you" and maybe "i'm home." the others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to.<br /><br />this is a weird film with strange undertones, but if that's what you're looking for, you won't find better.
