the color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life. every character had an element of the color purple in them. the movie touches on love, lost, hope, hate, and triumph. whether it be celie having lived through hell and losing her sister, and shug coming into her life to show her love again, albert not being man righting his wrong toward celie, shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end, sofia and her stubborness good and bad, and even nettie, they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and that's the sign of a good movie. good job to all the cast and crew.
