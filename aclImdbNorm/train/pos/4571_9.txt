the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day-lewis and hugh o'conor as christy brown, guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds. as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing. the enormous support that christy got form his family, low-income, working class dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book, but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy brown's witty arrogant personality. i do recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.
