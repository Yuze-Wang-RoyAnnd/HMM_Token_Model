johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories. the music is great, you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like (i've been there too), and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion. cash's narration is good too.<br /><br />but....<br /><br />1. the actor who played jesus was miscast. 2. there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. because it is uncompelling, i doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />i'd love to buy the cd.<br /><br />tom paine texas, usa
