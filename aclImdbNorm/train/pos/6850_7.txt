dressed to kill starts off with kate miller (angie dickinson) having a sexually explicit nightmare, later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr. robert elliott (michael caine) for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated & unfulfilled in her current marriage. kate then visits a museum & picks up a stranger, they go back to his apartment for casual sex, when done kate is set to leave but is attacked & killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman. prostitute liz blake (nancy allen) discovers the gruesome scene & sees the killer but manages to escape. detective marino (dennis franz) says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate's son peter (keith gordon) to track down the real killer, clear liz's name & see that justice is done...<br /><br />written & directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery. the script is measured & slow at times but it likes to focus on the character's so you really know them, the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off, then the film switches it's attentions to liz & no one else gets a look in. this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing & engaging, unfortunately the character's themselves aren't exactly likable. i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times, especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally. the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill. it's a good film but it didn't excite me that much & i didn't really find any character to root for or like. the film tacks on a needless & unnecessary twist ending that i didn't really see the point of.<br /><br />director de palma directs with style & visual flair, from the art museum sequence to a car chase & as a whole it's impeccably filmed throughout. i'd imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it. i felt the film was a bit flat & uninspired at times though, nothing about it really excited me that much. there is a fair bit of nudity, some sex & rape along with a few bits of gore & violence, kate's murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight, if that's the right word. however, it's by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $6,500,000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film. the new york locations are nice, the cinematography is good & as a whole it's extremely well made. i thought the music was inappropriate & was far to loud & intrusive. the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn't think caine had that much screen time. allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made, interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them, this & blow out (1981), he cast her as a prostitute... a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start.<br /><br />dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn't think it quite lived up to it's lofty reputation. good but not brilliant.
