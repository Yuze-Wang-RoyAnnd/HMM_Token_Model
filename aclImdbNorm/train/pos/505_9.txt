a very good start. i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced: it should have been cruder, to match we saw in the original series. the cast is interesting, although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human. she needs to school on spock who, after all, is the model for this race. too bad they couldn't have picked jeri ryan. i like ms. park, the korean(?)lady. the doctor has possibilities. haven't sorted out the other males, except for the black guy. he's a really likeable. bakula needs to find his niche--in ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. he is, of course, big and strong enough for the heroics. the heavies were ok, although i didn't like their make-up.
