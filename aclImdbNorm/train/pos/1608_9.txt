seeing "moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared. who knew that cher could act? who had ever heard of olympia dukakis? nicholas cage was the beginning of his career, and vincent gardenia and danny aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was norman jewison the director.<br /><br />the only really flat note in this splendid work is "when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore," a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music. <br /><br />cher is -- forgive me -- sensational as loretta castorini, a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom. aielo (johny cammareri) obliges by proposing, offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, then rushes off to sicily to be with his dying mother. he charges loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother, ronny, attends the wedding. loretta confronts ronny and quickly falls in love with him. meanwhile, her father (vincent gardenia) is cheating on her mother (olympia dukakis), which loretta accidentally discovers when ronny invites her to the metropolitan opera.<br /><br />everything works out in the end, as it inevitably does in films of this genre. in the meantime, all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself. in its way, "moonstruck" is how hollywood used to be at its best: rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever. if they'd only lost "that's amore" along the way, it would have been perfect.
