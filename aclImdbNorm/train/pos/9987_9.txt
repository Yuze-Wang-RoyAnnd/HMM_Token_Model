i was very moved by the story and because i am going through something similar with my own parents, i really connected. it is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate. and then there's the mistakes they made and have to live with. i loved ellen burstyn's performance and who is christine horne? she's fantastic! a real find. there is probably the most erotic scene i've ever seen in a film, yet nothing was shown - it was just so beautifully done. overall the look and feel of the film was stunning, a real emotional journey. cole hauser is very very good in this picture, he humanizes a man spiraling downwards. i liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to hook us in, but not enough to bog down.
