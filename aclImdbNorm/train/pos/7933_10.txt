good times working with the quiroz brothers, and the entire cast on this project as the "guy on the bench." i was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the identifiable traits of a true "b" horror film. hopefully i will have the opportunity to work with pumpkin patch pictures team again in the future. i moved to detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release. one time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind. it was pretty funny and that was my 1st real autograph moment as i signed her receipt. one day i asked the girl at blockbuster if the movie is rented often, and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer. at the time it was renting more than ring2 which was also a new release at the time... the title really captures immediate interest in the more urban markets. she also noticed on many occasions the movie had not been returned by the customer leading me to believe the movie is just so good people don't want to give it back.... watch out for zombies when in the hood cause they will get ya! jaysun barr (guy on the bench-2005)
