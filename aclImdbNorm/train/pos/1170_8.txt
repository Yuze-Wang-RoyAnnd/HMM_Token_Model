night of the living homeless is a funny spoof of the 1978 film(and the 2004 remake) of "dawn of the dead".only this time...with the homeless.the episode has homeless people all coming to south park and the people cannot figure out why.they treat the homeless like zombies who want change and a few of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie.so now it's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them.this is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the 2pac/dr.dre song "california love".overall a good episode.<br /><br />8/10
