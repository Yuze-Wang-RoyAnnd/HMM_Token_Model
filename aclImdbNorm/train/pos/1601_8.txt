it is quite a simple not very active but very charming film. there were moments where i can see why cher won the academy award for best actress, but there were other times when i wondered why glenn close didn't win for fatal attraction. anyway, oscar and golden globe winning, and bafta nominated cher plays loretta castorini, a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by mr. johnny cammareri (danny aiello) to marry him. he promises her he'll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible. only problem is, when she finds johnny's one-handless brother ronny (golden globe nominated nicolas cage), they start having a relationship, and there love goes on to that moon scene (where the title comes from). also starring oscar nominated vincent gardenia as cosmo castorini, oscar, bafta and golden globe winning olympia dukakis as rose castorini and john mahoney as perry. it ends with no wedding for johnny and loretta, but she and ronny were happy together. it won the oscar for best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen, and it was nominated for best director for norman jewison (in the heat of the night) and best picture, it was nominated the baftas for best score for dick hyman and best original screenplay, and it was nominated the golden globes for best motion picture - comedy/musical and best screenplay. it was number 96 on 100 years, 100 quotes ("snap out of it!"), it was number 17 on 100 years, 100 passions, and it was number 41 on 100 years, 100 laughs. very good!
