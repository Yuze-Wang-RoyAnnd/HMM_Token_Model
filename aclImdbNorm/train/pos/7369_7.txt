personally i couldn't get into 'this is not a love song', its a brilliant film and there's a great story line to it, i just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minuets to see how much was left of the film.<br /><br />i love the relationship between spike and heaton, there that close they depend on each other to get along in life. at the same time i wish the relationship was more than what it is. heaton is in love with spike, but spike ibsen't in love with heaton, or he doesn't know how to love him. the acts of betrayal, on both parts, have a big effect on the two men. they are both devastated by the fact that the other ran away and abandoned them, at a time when they truly needed each other for survival.
