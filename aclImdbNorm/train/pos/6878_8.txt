tho 35 years old, groove tube looks a lot like actual tv today! specialty niche networks (nude sports), a tv show about stoner drug dealers called the dealers (ala weeds, and even predating 1978's cheech & chong up in smoke), weird beer commercials (butz beer, no less bizarre than bud bowls), dirty-minded kid's clown koko (shades of pee wee herman), even chevy chase doing slapstick humor (a violent barbershop vocal duo) a year before his 1975 debut on saturday night live. and thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned groove tube an initial x-rating, i still can't hear curtis mayfield's "move on up" without thinking of naked dancing hitchhiking hippies ---- for similar sketch-style movies, see tunnelvision, kentucky fried movie, amazon women on the mood, monty python's beyond the fringe, dynamite chicken, and the firesign theatre's everything you know is wrong.
