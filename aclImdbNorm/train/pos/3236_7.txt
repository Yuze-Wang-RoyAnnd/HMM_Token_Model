half a dozen short stories of varying interest enlighten us about life in finland. these stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sonic boom is heard. this indicates that the events depicted happen at the same time.<br /><br />the film begins with a bungy jump which promises some excitement but the early stories are quite low key. the film improves so stick with it. two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief. the last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving.<br /><br />while the various scenes of family life take place in finland, the themes are of a general nature wherever you happen to live.<br /><br />collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90-minute drama.
