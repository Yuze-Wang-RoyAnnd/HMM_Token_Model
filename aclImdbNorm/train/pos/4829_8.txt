the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history. on the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront, director jean-marc vall'ee who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. it's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.<br /><br />taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert, the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer. instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life, vall'ee instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades. the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like, yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story, writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal. vall'ee takes this and runs, making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching.<br /><br />a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films. everything from the costume designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victoria's story without ever over-encumbering it. indeed, while watching vall'ee's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element; and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes' script. entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with, but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeri's original work just as well.<br /><br />yet for all the poignant compositions, lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene, the single most important factor here
