i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available. i had high expectations, and was not disappointed. it's funny, and the animation is excellent. that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films, so i'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it. maybe the dvd release had improved animation? one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. i'm an adult, and i really appreciate that it is for adults. it isn't only kids who like cute animated characters. it is nowhere near "raunchy" as some have claimed, but i can see where some parents wouldn't want their young children to see it. i'm very disappointed that it was cancelled. i wish they would produce more episodes. or perhaps a movie.
