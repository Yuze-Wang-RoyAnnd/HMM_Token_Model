remember ralph bakshi? the guy that was an animator on terrytoons, then on paramount cartoon studios, after that, he was a director on fritz the cat 1 & 2 and heavy traffic? well, this is coonskin. and it's actually pretty good. racist, but good. the movie takes place in harlem nights (no, duh, it was a working title.) but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie, song of the south.<br /><br />it's about sampson (barry white) and the preacherman (charles gordone) rush to help their friend, randy (philip michael thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police. while waiting for them, randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy (scatman crothers), as he begins to tell randy a story about "three guys, i used to know, just like you and your friends". pappy's story is told in animation set against live-action background photos and footage.<br /><br />brother rabbit (voice of thomas), brother bear (voice of white), and preacher fox (voice of gordone) decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel. arriving in harlem, rabbit, bear, and fox find that it isn't all that it's made out to be. they encounter a con man named simple savior, a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the "cousin" of black jesus, and that he gives his followers "the strength to kill whites". in a flashy stage performance in his "church", savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression
