john thaw is a an excellent actor. i have to admit that i was impressed by his range in the role of a crusty old curmudgeon who reluctantly agrees to take in an evacuee from the streets of london (wwii time era).<br /><br />that being said, the film is also excellent. a very moving story with a satisfying ending. some of the characters are a little underdeveloped (the school teacher in particular), but none of them are essential to the plot. basically, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the film needs little else.
