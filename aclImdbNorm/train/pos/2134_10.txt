ernst lubitsch's contribution to the american cinema is enormous. his legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever, as is the case with "the shop around the corner". this film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play, without the charm or elegance of mr. lubitsch's own, and definite version.<br /><br />margaret sullavan and james stewart worked in several films together. their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all. both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another, but who fate had them working together in the same shop in budapest.<br /><br />the reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture. in here, we have the wonderful frank morgan, playing the owner of the shop. also, we see joseph schildkraut, felix bressart, william tracy and charles smith, among others, doing impressive work in making us believe that yes, they are in budapest.<br /><br />that is why these films will live forever!
