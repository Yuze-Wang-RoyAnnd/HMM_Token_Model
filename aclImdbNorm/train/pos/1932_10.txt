i think i usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be "quirky," and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complicated context. what was exceptional about big bad swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laugh-out-loud humor in scene after scene. there was a sophistication, maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the dp, i've rarely seen in an indie film, and even more rarely in a comedy. of special note here: paget brewster's turn as amy the math teacher. after seeing this performance i cannot understand why brewster hasn't been "discovered" by a larger audience. she brings the necessary mix of anger and likability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential. this is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience. i look forward to more from the director and this cast!
