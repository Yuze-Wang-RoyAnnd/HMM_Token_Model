the only notable thing about this film is that it was steve mcqueen's first big starring role.<br /><br />mcqueen's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci-fi horror piece. steve shows himself as the anti-establishment, hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence.<br /><br />later on, mcqueen would say he hated this film and that "he was the blob". but everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is cute, fresh and innocent. would that we all had stayed that way.<br /><br />the plot is fast paced and although predictable, still an entertaining hour or so. and it's really fun to see steve mcqueen before he became the king of kool (and anita corsaut before she became andy taylor's girlfriend). a close friend sent me the dvd a while back and it's a treasured addition to my steve mcqueen film collection.
