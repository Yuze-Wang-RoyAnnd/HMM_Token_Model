once again jet li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film black mask. in this film li plays tsui, an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him. to do this tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace. other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as tsui, but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace. thus tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives. this film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go. the martial arts is amazing, but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by american audiences. if you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts, then black mask is for you. i am glad to see that some of jet li's movies are finally getting main stream release in the united states and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require (things like dubbing and soundtrack) will affect the film. this is one of li's best films, go out and see it on may 14 when it is released in america.
