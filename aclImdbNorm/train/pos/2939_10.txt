eddie murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably the funniest. delirious is the best stand-up comedy i've ever seen and it is a must-have for anyone who loves a good laugh!! i've watched this movie hundreds of times and every time i see it - i still have side-splitting fun. this is definitely one for your video library. i guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much - that you will miss half of them! delirious is hilarious!<br /><br />although there are a lot of funny comedians out there - after watching this stand-up comedy, most of them will seem like second-class citizens. if you have never seen it - get it, watch it - and you will love it!! it will make you holler!!! :-)
