i already loved "how the grinch stole christmas" when it was released and i'm still loving it now, 5 years later. still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out.<br /><br />sure, the movie is over-the-top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. all of the sets, costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way, without ever becoming truly ridicules. it's a visually spectacular movie to watch. it's a campy movie making at its very best! director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas movie.<br /><br />main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is jim carrey as the grinch. he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role. he is of course helped by the convincing make-up, which also received an academy award. of course if you're a jim carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. this movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch. other fun and memorable roles are being played by jeffrey tambor, clint howard and josh ryan evans as the young grinch.<br /><br />the movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me. perhaps it's because i'm dutch and we don't really celebrate christmas that enthusiastic and big here, as in the united states or england. for me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest.<br /><br />the musical score by james horner is good and fun, even though it's your average every day horner stuff, it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work.<br /><br />perfect christmas entertainment.<br /><br />8/10
