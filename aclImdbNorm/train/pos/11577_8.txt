this was a really cool movie. it just goes to prove that you don't need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. it traverses continents in seconds, people get shot and nothing happens to them, swords set on fire, samuari fight on sinking galleons, david essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and john rhys davies is just the dude. i enjoyed this movie but i like s**t movies, this is the perfect example of a very s**t movie that just kicks ass. if you like battlefield earth you'll love this film, its swashbuckling, its fast, its silly, its samuaraitastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />it also looks as if it was made in 1972
