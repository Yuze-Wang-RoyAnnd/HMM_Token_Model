actually... that "video camera" effect, is just that, it's an effect, a rather good one.. (u don't know much about directing a film do you?) this film is in fact better than the original, it's great fun to watch, made for tv, doesn't need to follow any rules. i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl, its disturbing. and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it, we as the viewers are on his side. i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it. watching this film you can understand how real movies are made, as this is sort of like a film within a film. judd is one of the scariest villains ever, and he's more realistic, he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors.
