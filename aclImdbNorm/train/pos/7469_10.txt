this film was just absolutly brilliant. it actually made me think. during the whole movie i was confused as hell. i loved everything about it...it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird, it was hard not to love it. all of the actors were phenominal, and no one could have done a better job...this is one of my favorites of the year...it deserves an ocar.
