when i saw this animation for first time (i was 15 maybe) i was really impressed! it has completely different style compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more. tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark...the colors are not that ...colorous. the characters don't talk much, there are no long and boring conversations of this and that (like in ghost in the shell).with its dark pictures, views of strange beasts and sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient scandinavian stories, full of violence and horrendous creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, dwelled by dragons, throlls, orks...and one mysterious hero to stop evil...
