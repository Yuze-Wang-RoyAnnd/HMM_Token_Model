previously, i wrote that i loved "titanic", cried at its ending (many times over), and i'm a guy in his 60's. i also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.<br /><br />well, i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings. while 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating. these 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. <br /><br />in my previous comments, i blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for leonardo dicaprio. believe me, i've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right. they absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in "titanic". (to answer one other user: i am not talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste. but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for "titanic", pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.)<br /><br />let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of "titanic" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). "heaven's gate" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1). "big top pee-wee" (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). "cat people" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). "blind date" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). "jumpin' jack flash" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). what do all of these films have in common with "titanic"? all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower !!!! than "titanic", and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award. again, "titanic" got 10.7% 1 ratings! compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned.<br /><br />can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor?<br /><br />
