"show people" is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines. what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, peggy pepper, whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen. though she's a success in comedy, what she wants to do is make "art" so she moves up to high arts studio. soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billy.<br /><br />many stars of the silent era have cameos in "show people," including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup. i'm sure when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; sadly, nowadays, it's not the case, even for film buffs. in one part of the film, however, she does meet charlie chaplin; in another, author elinor glyn is pointed out to her, and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. other stars who pop up in "show people" are john gilbert, douglas fairbanks, william s. hart, leatrice joy, bess flowers, renee adoree, rod laroque, aileen pringle, and many others.<br /><br />davies was adorable and a lively comedienne. it's a shame william haines quit the movies - he was cute and energetic, deservedly an enormous star back in the day.<br /><br />"show people" is a simple story told in a witty way. it's also a look back at an exciting era in hollywood's history and contains performances by two wonderful stars.
