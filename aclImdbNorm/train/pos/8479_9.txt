watching this several times as a child was quite the experience 15 years ago, and now that i've found it again it still has a film experience like few others. if risky, it's a great display of morals and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young kids. while it still holds up as an adult, i was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago. trying to find it today is hard enough . . . but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age. anime fans especially will find this a great entry to masami hata's filmography. with impressive art work and unique designs, "chirin no suzu" represents a worthwhile experience. while some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in english, the musical score is nevertheless captivating. but even the voice acting is far better than much released today. unfortunately is went out of print in the mid-1980s from rca columbia home video, and has not received any new format release to my knowledge, at least in the us. look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied! it's an artful, intense, enjoyable, and important landmark in japanese animation.
