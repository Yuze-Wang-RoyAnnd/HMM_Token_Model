a lot of talk has been made about "psychological westerns", but this is one of the very few that is truly in that genre. it has big name stars who perform very well, but it is the director who makes this such a good movie. stewart granger loses his british safari hunter stereotype to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the west as one of the best. robert taylor plays the upstart (in contrast to the usual young upstart, taylor's character is middle aged, too), who wants to slaughter buffalo, and lures granger into business with him. they hire two other big name actors, lloyd nolan and russ tamblyn, into being their skinners. granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed, knowing that he may be to blame if they become extinct, knowing if they become extinct, the native american way of life will greatly suffer. taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic saidism, unlike the one dimensional sadists of modern film, created by nerds and dorks. he is insecure, and needs human companionship. still, he won't stop at murder. the end pits the two against each other, with a startling conclusion. the psychological effects of what they're doing are well depicted.
