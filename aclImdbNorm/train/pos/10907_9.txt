was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so i turned to my twin sister and said, "hey this looks like fun," - truly i love documentaries - so we started watching it. at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... i cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another kleenex, then cried some more. once jonni kennedy's "time was up" he flew to heaven to be with the angels. he was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. i highly recommend this. if you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.
