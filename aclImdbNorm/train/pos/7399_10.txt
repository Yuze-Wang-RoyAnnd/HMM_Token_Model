my choice for greatest movie ever used to be laughton's "night of the hunter" which remains superb in my canon. but, it may have been supplanted by "shower" which is the most artistically daoist movie i have seen. the way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water, and the way that water can be made inspiration, and comfort, and cleansing, and etc. is the essence of the dao. it is possible to argue that the the nofth and shower themes are similar, and that lillian gish in the former represents the purest form of christianity as the operators of the bathhouse represent the purest form of daoism. i would not in any way argue against such an interpretation. both movies are visual joys in their integration of idea and image. yet, shower presents such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that i give it the nod. i revere both.
