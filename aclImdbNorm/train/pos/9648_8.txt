i liked this film very much. the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow. there is no resolution to the story whatsoever, and you are left to wonder what really happened. since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this. i especially like the "dating" scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives. and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra points. ;-)
