things to come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. it makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's utopian ideals.<br /><br />raymond massey, cedric hardwicke, and ralph richardson make up a fine cast, although the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. there are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. however, there are some profound words there. is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? the film is a visual feast, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. sure, hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive. for the imaginative, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors. it has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise.<br /><br />things to come and metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic hollywood science fiction cinema. they are operatic in scope, and visually inspiring. technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth. there is an artistry there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. these films are the products of artisans, not industrialists.
