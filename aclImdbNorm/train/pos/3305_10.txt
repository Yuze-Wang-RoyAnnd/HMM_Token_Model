without question, this film has to be one of the greatest ........ in cinematic history. i have it watched too many times to remember, and each time it is like i am seeing the film for the first time.<br /><br />where does one begin?<br /><br />meena kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career, followed closely by sahib bibi aur ghulam and phool aur pathar. each movement and nuance of her performance, makes any other bollywood heroine pale into significance. her masterly interpretation of kathak coupled with her grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of urdhu, is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen.<br /><br />pakeezah is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition; the photography, sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene, are so charged with symbolism and meaning, that the viewer is left breathless.<br /><br />naushads music, is unsurpassed, his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible, and the way in which he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable.<br /><br />my only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema, should watch this epic mediation on life and art.
