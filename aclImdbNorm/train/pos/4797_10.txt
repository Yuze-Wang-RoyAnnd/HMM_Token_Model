i have always been a fan of david lynch and with this film lynch proved to critics that he has the talent, style, and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he's become known for in the past decade. as much as the film is g-rated, it's pure lynch in style, pacing, and tone. the film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power.<br /><br />the cinematography is terrific, as is to be expected from a lynch film, and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking. it's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly, kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either "good" or "evil".<br /><br />richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast, most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher, and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.<br /><br />with this film, david lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'blue velvet' and 'the elephant man'. critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'twin peaks: fire walk with me' and 'lost highway' but with this film he showed that there was method to fwwm and lh, and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'mulholland drive', considering the high praise it's received and the oscar nomination for lynch.<br /><br />'straight story' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures i've ever seen. it's a loving story about family, friendship, and the kindness of strangers. i would highly recommend it.
