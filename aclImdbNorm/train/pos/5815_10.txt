i was a kid .. crazy about michael jackson. his music, his dancing .. he was and is the greatest of all times. few days ago a friend gave me a present .. "moonwalker" dvd .. i just couldn't believe it! so i took my time and saw the movie again.. after a lot of years, and it kicked me back in time. i almost cried. not because of michael jackson but of the good old times i remembered back than when i went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. the movie gave me some other perspective than back then when i was a kid. you can truly see the parody that michael went through his life. thank you michael jackson to bring me back to those great times, to your great music and dancing. it's a shame that people has forgotten you .. i didn't because you gave me great moments with your music .. all the best to you where ever you are out there ..
