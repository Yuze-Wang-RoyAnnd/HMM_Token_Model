sammi, curr a metal rock god, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, the tried to censor his music!! (much like the real life dee snider, from twisted sister,[tipper gore] or ozzy osborne) killed in a fire, sammi cure was suppose to play on halloween at his old high school for a dance.. now eddie weinbauer , his #1 fan, and the only one who knew how sammi was, and what he felt (or did he?) nuke, the d.j. at the local radio station (gene simmons) has and gives the only copy of sammi's last record eddie.. but when eddie tries to play the record backwards, he finds sammi talking to him from the dead, and telling him what to do to get back at the bullies at his school that hate him and his music.. everything works out until, sammi starts to kill!! a great movie and must see for heavy metal hairband fans, with a great sound track by fastway, and just in case you don't know what the songs sound like or know fastway and doesn't like them, they changed there voice a bit and there style as well to sound like the more known cinderella, or ratt.. is the movie a true horror movie? well that depends on what you call a horror movie, to me a true horror movie is a slasher, with lots of killing, or just plain be scary.. this movie is neither, not enough deaths, but it can't be called a action, comedy, drama, suspense, or thriller, so that is why i would guess it has to be a horror.. so if you wanna "rock n' roll, rockin' on the mid night steel your soul!!" than sammi curr and trick or treat is the for you.. i mean "what are you afraid of? it's only rock 'n' roll!?!"
