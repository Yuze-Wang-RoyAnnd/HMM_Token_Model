i've seen this movie about 6 times now. and each time i view it, i'm more impressed by the story and the acting. its like watching a train wreck being set in motion. its subtle in its approach, but very effective in reaching its goal. <br /><br />spoilers-> at the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy. on the one hand we have deputy major, eddy calhoun (cusack) unknowingly tearing at the old boys network that forms the hart of major of new york's administration and on the other hand we have the mob boss zappati who's deliberately trying to maintain the status quo through all means necessary. this situation nicely culminates in the end when zappati orders alselmo to make it easy on himself by killing himself and calhoun ordering pappas to do the same, politically speaking.<br /><br />the movie also contains some really great one-liners such as (a personal weakness of mine): - you don't sum up a man's life in one moment - the only thing new in this world is the history you don't know<br /><br />all in all, a great movie that deserves a much higher rating.
