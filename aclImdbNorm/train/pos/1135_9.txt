i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out, and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun. this is a great cast of characters, many big names in it, a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now. i think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors, or have loved them in other movies, to add it to your watched list. some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well-done comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue, kind of odd spontaneous-appearing comedy, with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors. the movie did a great job at giving you some insight, perhaps even very realistic, into the culture of a daytime soap.
