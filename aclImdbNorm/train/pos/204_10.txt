first off, i dislike almost all neil simon movies. but there is something about this that is unique, that draws me in, and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen. the second time i watched it, the connection was clear. when did neil simon meet my grandmothers? <br /><br />ah, afraid they might sue, so he changed them into men. and how dull would it be if they were only housewives, show biz stars is more fun. well this is a personal review, and my still living grandmother at age 97 (she even outlived walter matthau's magnificent impersonation of her!)would deny it -- but some of you must find resonance in these characters.<br /><br />secondly, i have little tolerance for george burns, but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character).<br /><br />very ethnic in flavor, and over the top, you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off. for me, the pleasure lingers.
