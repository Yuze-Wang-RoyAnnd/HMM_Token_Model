entertaining jim belushi vehicle, a modern cockeyed version of it's a wonderful life. michael caine plays a sort-of angel who lets belush see what life would have been like if he had "made it big". jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast; seems like real chemistry between him and hamilton. not an oscar contender but good warm-hearted fun.
