i really liked tom barman's awtwb. you just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts, and don't expect anything. it's like sitting on a caf'e-terrace with a beer, in the summer sun, and watching the people go by. it definitely won't keep you pondering afterwards, that's true, but that's not a prerequisite for a good film. it's just the experience during the movie that's great.<br /><br />i felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more, but being a lynch fan i don't care that much anymore :)<br /><br />and i *loved* the style, or flair of this movie. it's slick, but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty. any music-lover will get his kicks out of awtwb, i can assure you.<br /><br />i'll give it 8 out 10.<br /><br />(music-wise 10 out of 10)
