another one of those films you hear about from friends (...or read about on imdb). not many false notes in this one. i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead-end home town in tennessee to florida, with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten-up car.<br /><br />the heroine, ruby, makes some false starts, but learns from them. i found myself wondering why, why didn't she lean a bit more on mike's shoulder, but...she has her reasons, as it turns out.<br /><br />just a fine film. the only thing i don't much like about it, i think, is the title.
