in the winter of 1931, supposedly 12-year-old tyler hoechlin (as michael sullivan jr.) wonders what his mobster father tom hanks (michael "mike" sullivan) does for a living. young hoechlin follows mr. hanks to "work" one evening, and witnesses him blasting away some rival gangsters. this leads - in a very roundabout way - to "godfather"-type paul newman (as john rooney) hiring independent hit-man jude law (as harlen maguire) to track down hoechlin and hanks, who are off to cool their heels in chicago. hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative, which is puzzling when you consider the characters' line of work.<br /><br />looking uncannily like paul peterson ("the donna reed show"), hoechlin does a terrific job for director sam mendes; and, getting to work with this cast makes him the luckiest young actor of 2002. but, the most striking thing about "road to perdition" is the stunning cinematography of conrad l. hall, which deservedly won a career capping "academy award" for the late photographer. mr. hall's work is truly superlative. this helps make up for the overall impression of a measured, contrived staginess to both the narrative and visuals. the deviating end is abruptly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess).<br /><br />******** road to perdition (7/12/02) sam mendes ~ tom hanks, tyler hoechlin, paul newman, jude law
