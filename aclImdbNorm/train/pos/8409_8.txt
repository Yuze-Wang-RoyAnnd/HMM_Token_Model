a good film, and one i'll watch a number of times. rich (the previous commenter)is right: there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards, and i have to wonder how much has suffered in translation. were there more in the original? or was a native-language audience expected to lip-read more? or -- since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based -- was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? in short, very worth a look, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it.<br /><br />the alpha video release touts the new organ score, but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way. sure, it starts promisingly, but degenerates into a repetitive, phillip-glass-like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen. after listening for a while, i turned off the sound and simply watched: much better!
