me and my girlfriend, annette, watched this together and we'll both comment.<br /><br />both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with dicken's work. a lot of dicken's works are somewhat dark and dreary (including oliver twist), but this movie changed all that. it was fun, colourful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more lighthearted.<br /><br />travis: normally, i don't care a lot for musical and dance movies, but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively, and the choreography was awesome.<br /><br />annette: that's really saying a lot coming from travis. i can't emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were. you can tell, for example, that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfection.<br /><br />travis: three actors really stood out imo; nancy (shani w.), bill sykes (oliver reed), and artful dodger (jack wild). man, that oliver reed can really do a good villain. that one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the back...awesome. and that kid jack wild was a perfect artful dodger. and nancy was fantastic (man, i felt bad when she got killed). she can sing too! kudos to the casting department on their choices there. i hated the oliver twist kid tho. he was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste. (i kept wishing bill sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene.) and they shouldn't have had him sing either.<br /><br />annette: acting was truly superb. in addition to the three stars travis mentioned, i felt ron moody (fagin) did a tremendous job. he was so funny, and at the same time lightly sinister too. the supporting actors were great too. harry secombe carried his mr. bumble role extremely well. and he has a wonderful singing voice. i saw mr. secombe perform in another movie entitled "davy" where he played an opera singer with pleasing results. the talented harry secombe should have been in a lot more movies.<br /><br />travis: as i mentioned earlier the story isn't quite true to the book, but imo it was more robust. this movie was not boring either, as some musicals seem to be. and the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters. the tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too long.<br /><br />annette: any musical movie which travis watches completely has to be a rare find. and this one is indeed a rare find. it is a very easy-to-watch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end. in a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces, this was a refreshing interlude.<br /><br />our combined rating for this was 8.5 of 10. (we'll round up to 9 in this case.).<br /><br />travis: i rated this a 7 mainly because the oliver twist kid (mark l.) irritated me, and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears. otherwise, it was an outstanding movie.<br /><br />annette: my rating is a 10. movies don't get much better than this. and you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was...a masterpiece.<br /><br />please don't miss this one...even if you normally don't like musicals. it really is a rare treat.
