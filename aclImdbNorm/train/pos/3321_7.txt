i saw "fever pitch" sort of by accident; it was playing on the airplane going over to europe. it actually wasn't half bad. ben (jimmy fallon) is the world's #1 red sox fan, but his relationship with lindsay meeks (drew barrymore) may strain that. the movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect peoples' relationships. it's especially eye-opening now that the red sox have ended their 80-odd-year losing streak. i guess that these sorts of things happen all the time and we just don't tend to notice them. not too bad.<br /><br />another movie portraying an unusual relation to baseball is 2000's "frequency". check them both out.
