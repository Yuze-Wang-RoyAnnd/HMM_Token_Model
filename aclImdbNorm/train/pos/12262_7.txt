some thirty years ago, author numa sadoul published a book length interview with the belgian comic book artist georges remi (better known as herge, the creator of tintin). this movie catches up with sadoul today as he recalls the interview, while we listen to the cassettes (herge died in 1983) and see some old photos and footage of the man himself. some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of herge, and we now know these dealt with his separation from his wife, after he had an affair with one of his collaborators (who years later would become his second wife). an interesting thing the movie does not address well is the shift in the tintin books from the early rightist and imperialist books (tintin in the congo, tintin in the lands of the soviets) to fairly anti-imperialist books just a few years later (the blue lotus). on the whole, i come out of this movie knowing a few more things about herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when i come in to the theater.
