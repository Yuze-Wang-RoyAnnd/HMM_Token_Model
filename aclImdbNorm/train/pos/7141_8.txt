since siskel's death and ebert's absence the show has been left in the incapable hands of richard roeper. roeper is not a film critic he just criticizes anything he doesn't like personally i.e. films with country music get panned because "i don't like country music!" and children's movies get a standard "don't see it now, wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it for your kids!" roeper may well be an idiot savant, but in some other field. the weekly guests 'sitting-in' for ebert fare better, but who wants to pick a daisy in the midst of a cow pat? all that said, it is the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching. as for roger ebert, if stephen hawking can talk, so can you! it's your mind and thoughts we long for. do whatever is necessary to get that usurper off his self-declared throne.
