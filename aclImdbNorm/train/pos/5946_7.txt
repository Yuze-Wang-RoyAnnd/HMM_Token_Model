"world's finest" is an unique project. it's a trailer for a superman/batman crossover movie that doesn't exists and will also never exists, at least not in this form, with these characters, actors and plot line anyway.<br /><br />so the movie is one big tease, even more than standards everyday real movie trailers. the trailer will hype you all up for nothing. in that regard, i really didn't liked this short project. when watching this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad- and perhaps you'll even feel cheated afterward, when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist at all. sort of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place. surely to show off sandy collora's skills but couldn't he had also done this with a real movie short, like his earlier movie "batman: dead end".<br /><br />but when you have to judge this short purely for what it is, so from a movie technical point of view, it's a really great one. it's great looking and way more professional than you'll perhaps at first would expect, although the people who've already seen "batman: dead end" will already know better than to expect a short with cardboard sets, cheap homemade costumes and third-rate actors. the short is not constantly impressive looking and obviously the budget wasn't sky-high but for most part it's very impressive and professional looking, with nice costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting.<br /><br />the short has a good quick and typical trailer build up, with perhaps a bit too many posing shots too completely find it credible but hey, it works well for the trailer style. it has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones, mainly the superman flying sequences. it was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car, with a camera aimed at him from an angle below. i even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch. but really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this.<br /><br />michael o'hearn seemed like a pretty good superman/clark kent, although he obviously isn't the greatest talented actor around. clark bartram reprises his batman role well again and kurt carley seemed like an awesome lex luthor. the rest of the cast also served its purpose well enough.<br /><br />it's especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this movie, in the movies "batman begins" and "superman returns". it's interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one. it's actually amazing and fun to hear how much kurt carley does sound like kevin spacey, the actor who played lex luthor in "superman returns".<br /><br />it's a good looking and well made and constructed trailer that however will makes you hungry for more, even though you know that there won't be more. whatever happened to the waner bros. plans to create an actual full length superman/batman movie by the way? i thought that developments were underway for it a couple of years ago but nothing has been heard of it ever since. instead two new separate batman and superman movies were made; "batman begins" and "superman returns".<br /><br />7/10
