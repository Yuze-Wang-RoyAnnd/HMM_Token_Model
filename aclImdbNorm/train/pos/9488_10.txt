highly memorable, intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of french movies' true geniuses, the formidably able henri verneuil. the plot is an exact parallel of the jfk assassination, and takes place in a non-descript, fictional country. the film, visually as well as plot-wise, is razor-sharp. shot with meticulous precision, it follows henry volnay, the procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup. in many ways, it's a very disturbing movie, not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a so-called modern state's inner workings. the atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable, and verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting. on another level, this relatively little-known movie just had a 15 years head-start on oliver stone, who was acclaimed for the "jfk" movie, a inferior film in many areas, the least of which not being credibility...<br /><br />it's a masterpiece, any cinema lover should see it, preferably in its original french version with subs.
