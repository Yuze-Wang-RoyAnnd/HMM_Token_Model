they had me from the first show.<br /><br />welcome to trinity county. a sleepy little mayberry-like place with one slight difference. the sheriff is really satan. there's the spoiler. not like you wouldn't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway.<br /><br />oh, but that's not all. it turns out that satan has a son named caleb. some people are trying to keep him good, but it's an uphill battle. sheriff buck (satan) knows who caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. subtle. sneaky. he doesn't always come off as evil. most of the time he's a hero. everyone owes him a big favor, because he often sets up a calamity and saves them from it. so every time you think someone will finally take him down, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it.<br /><br />in one of my favorite episodes, lucas and caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them. lucas used it as an excuse to teach caleb a lesson about evil.<br /><br />the robber (ted) was hesitant to shoot them. lucas told caleb that ted had half a conscience. if he had no conscience, he would have shot them by now. if he had a real conscience, he never would have become a criminal. so he started calling him half-ted. it was pretty funny. he was taunting the criminals. and of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of half-ted at all times. and of course he was in complete control at all times. they actually had you favoring satan.<br /><br />very very excellent show. it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. twilight zone night stalker circle of fear american gothic supernatural<br /><br />that's good company.
