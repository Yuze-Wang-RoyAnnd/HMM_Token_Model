all dogs go to heaven is the most cutest animated film to have dogs in 1989. the previous don bluth film the land before time(1988) became a success. dogs are so cute as little mice. aw, i just want to hug them when they're cute. where was i? oh, yes. its animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they're perfectly voiced and the songs are cute and touching. it opened in november 17 1989 the same date as the little mermaid produced by walt disney feature animation.<br /><br />the part where charlie got killed by carface was so unforgivable. carface is so mean because he wanted to kill charlie. shame on him! the love survive song performed by irene cara and freddie jackson was so beautiful. all dogs go to heaven is the best animated movie ever.
