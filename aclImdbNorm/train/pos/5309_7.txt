the best thing about this movie is that it is fun. it is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the blithe, innocent pecker (played appealingly by edward furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. other great characters include pecker's friend matt ("he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy"), pecker's sister chrissy (who is addicted to sugar), and pecker's catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the virgin mary in her room.<br /><br />the movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer, and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy-handed about it. there is always a risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of "common people", of sliding into a kind of reverse "holier than thou" - but "pecker" avoids these traps, allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject.<br /><br />i recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun.
