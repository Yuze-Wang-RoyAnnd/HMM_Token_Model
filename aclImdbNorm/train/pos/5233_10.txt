one is tempted to define the genre of gert de graaff's movie as `event of the thought' following the example of merab mamardashvili. the nominal storyline is a certain bart klever's torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality. the script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination. this film-monologue originated as a response to fellini's `8  1/2 ' and cost gert de graaff 13 years of work. excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience, it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary, the paradoxical co-existence in two different galaxies: that of guttenberg and that of maclhuen. for some time we are apt to side with the script writer, who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality (`man', `catholic', `window washer'). and together with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma: how can one eliminate from the future movie. bart klever? just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator, who is deeply immersed in work, we realize that together with the main character we have again been `framed'. really, what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one's own name and the day-to-day care for the young daughter?<br /><br />so who is he, this bart klever? is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like frenhoffer from balzac's masterpiece (just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written)? gert de graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves.<br /><br />
