i really like this film... when i started to watch it i thought i would get bored pretty soon, but it surprised me... i thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now. the characters are believable and i have to say that i fell in love with brian austin green all over again (the first time being beverly hills 90210). i would recommend this film if you are a fan of his, but i do agree with another comment made earlier, that the ending is sort of disappointing. i would have loved it to turn out a little different! never mind though, good gripping story.
