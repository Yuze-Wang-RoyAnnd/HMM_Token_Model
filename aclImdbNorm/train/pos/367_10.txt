"the color purple", is truly amazing. there is none like it, and i don't think there ever will be. it's a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on. the actors are flawless and the directing is superb. i absolutely loved it. a movie has never made me so happy. it is beautiful, that's the best way to explain it.
