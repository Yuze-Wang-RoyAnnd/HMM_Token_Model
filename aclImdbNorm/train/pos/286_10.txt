i read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad....i think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies. if you are not a person that enjoyed the waltons or little house...u will not understand nor enjoy these movies...<br /><br />now about loves abiding joy...i knew he was bad news from the start of the movie....i wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it. this movie has a lot to do with jeff....it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in girls.<br /><br />i want to say that i have enjoyed all 4 movies so far....was not crazy about the books...cant wait until the next movie. the way clark talks will get you every time. i would love to see january jones do an appearance...maybe a family reunion or something.
