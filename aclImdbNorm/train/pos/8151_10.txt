i saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban. the showing i attended had a sprinkling of african-americans, and it made the difference in audience-reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country. basically, the white folks were afraid to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits --and there are many! -- because they'd be "laughting at blacks", while the blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn't laugh at themselves in front of the whites. <br /><br />i, on the other hand, being asian (and thus belonging to neither group), had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos/trappings/values/pseudo-philosophies. the cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed. the songs are too funny to be believed.<br /><br />this film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come along, including "a mighty wind"
