man on fire was hot. i love a classic tale of good ol' revenge, and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl.<br /><br />the writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between creasy (denzel washington) and pita (dakota fanning) so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive creasy had to rescue pita. it was also good that creasy wasn't a choir boy type trying to rescue pita through the "proper" channels, but instead used torture tactics and street smarts. some may say, "torture is wrong regardless," and you may be right, but when you see the pain creasy goes through due to the loss of pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back, you can't help but side with creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless. there would be no progress if creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that.<br /><br />creasy's quest ended with the return of pita to her mother and creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys. but creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie, it in fact enhanced it by showing that creasy was willing to die to get pita back. his death was noble in fact.<br /><br />denzel does an excellent job as do the writers. this movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie.
