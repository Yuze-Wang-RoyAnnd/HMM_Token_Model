i love this show. period. i haven't been watching very long, probably only about six months or so, actually, but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while. i love all of the characters, except i don't really care for donna. i'm not completely sure why. i just..don't find her funny, and i don't think laura prepon is a very good actress. other than her, i find the rest of the cast pretty good. kurtwood smith and debra joe rupp, who played erics parents, were extremely funny. topher grace is also a great actor. unlike a lot of fans, i did not completely hate the 8th season. i still watch it, and it does make me laugh. but, if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons, its..not good. randy is horrible. the finale was decent, nothing amazing, but good. =] i do think it would have been better to cancel the show after ashton and topher decided to leave, but oh well. i have the fourth season on dvd, and someday i hope to have all eight seasons on dvd. some of its most hilarious episodes, in my opinion, were 'dine&dash', 'grandmas dead', 'red&stacey', and 'streaking', but i love every episode i've seen so far, which is most of them, i think. =] 9/10 stars, i would definitely recommend it. =]
