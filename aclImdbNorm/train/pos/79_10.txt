i loved the real mc coys (1957-1963) it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear. she was excellent in the show. of course walter brennan was great as well as tony mart'inez. i loved it when he called amos se~nor grampa.i have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons 2-6.if only there would be more shows on television like this one, everything would be better. this show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared. god bless all the departed members of the cast and please,llydia reed, make yourself known again to the public. you are loved and respected. the real mc coys will live forever.
