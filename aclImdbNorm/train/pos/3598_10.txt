being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies, feeling they only focus on the boxing and not the characters themselves, this movie truly moved me. i loved being able to see the main character diana(michelle rodriguez) go through so many things in such a short while, it was amazing to me. michelle (rodriguez) did such a wonderful job playing diana especially since this was her first acting experience, she showed true emotion and portrayed diana wonderfully. all actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing. i highly recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
