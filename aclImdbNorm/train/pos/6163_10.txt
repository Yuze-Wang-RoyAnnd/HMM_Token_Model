this is one of the few films where i consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book. the story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional. i adored the cyclical rendition of 'the old home guard' and the charming 'portobello road', a great combination of early animation + real actors techniques which, though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece. the background of the second world war worked well and was not omitted as the film got under way, which so often happens in 'evacuee' stories.<br /><br />an often far too underrated film, it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages. the performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed. guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
