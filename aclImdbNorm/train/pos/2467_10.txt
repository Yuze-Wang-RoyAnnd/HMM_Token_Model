why didn't this pick up a bag full of oscars? it is an amazing interpretaion of an oft-filmed/performed piece. the visuals are breathtaking (especially in wide-screen...the pan & scan really kills this film's wonderful cinematography and sets). every frame is a painting. astounding. the play is almost completely intact, and branagh's passion for it is clear from the opening titles on. no zefferelli here, just great storytelling the way only film can, but rarely does. jacobi is especially perfect as hamlet's murderous uncle: he doesn't play him as a mustache- curling evil villian, but a charming politician, allowing us to see why only hamlet suspects foul play. branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between hamlet's fake/real madness and the burning revenge inside him. and the many cameos come off quite well, everyone from billy crystal and robin williams to gerard depardeu and charlton heston, unobtrusive if you are sucked into branagh's vision the way i was. a mesmerizing piece.
