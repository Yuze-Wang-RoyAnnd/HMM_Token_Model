pandro s. berman was "in charge of production" but that made him the so-called line producer. but who produced this epic, filmed not in arizona but in california's mohave desert where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants of the "gold temple", the thuggee huts, the british outpost at muri, the village of tantrapur, etc. the minor technical faults can and must be forgiven. what's unforgivable is the lack of an oscar for best music, although maybe the academy didn't offer such at the time. a single theme was played in various tempos including waltz, march and sweet, mood-setting. brilliant! one of the curious aspects of the production was the widow kipling's demands. an actor playing kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. in the initial release his scenes were cut, per mrs. kipling's demands. later they were included and lent a "connection" of kipling's immortal poem to ben hecht's screenplay. interestingly, this very typically and pro-british story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the british.
