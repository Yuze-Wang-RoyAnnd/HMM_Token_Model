this is a pretty decent example of film noir. the setting is the early 50's with the communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the us government.<br /><br />richard widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples. he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing a-list about him. the interesting thing was that he was not only an anti-hero but through most of the film, an unlikeable anti-hero. that is not very normal. jean peters gave a so-so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold. that great character actress thelma ritter shines as the stool-pigeon.<br /><br />the plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and tough talk. there is a fight scene near the end of the movie (in the subway station) that was pretty gritty and exciting.<br /><br />i think noir fans (like myself) will enjoy this film. for non-noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole commie thing a tad overdone.
