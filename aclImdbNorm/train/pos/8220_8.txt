the fourth in the "dirty harry" series, this film features one of the most despicable, ugliest, unlikable, profane, disgusting females i have ever seen on film: "ray perkins," played by audrie neenan. she is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945 "detour" character, "ann savage."<br /><br />her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up....and least some of her! then i could enjoy the rest of the movie.<br /><br />everywhere "harry callahan" (clint eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows.....within minutes! it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving, entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one.<br /><br />this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts.....and connects, sad to say. most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end, and who does it better than dirty harry?
