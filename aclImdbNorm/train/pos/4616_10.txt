the title of this film is taken from a party game called "seven minutes in heaven." the game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in brooklyn, ny, and he describes it as something like "spin-the-bottle," "lifesaver relay," and other preteen kissing games. according to the rules, a boy's name and a girl's would be drawn, and the chosen ones ordered to get into a dark closet together and to stay there for seven minutes. in the meantime, there would be speculation among party guests as to whether or not the two had the nerve to hold hands, embrace, and/or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet. at the end of seven minutes, the game leader would say, "time's up" or knock on the closet door, and the couple would emerge from the closet. after being quizzed by the other guests, the couple would have to admit what they had done during their "seven minutes in heaven." then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated. the couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winners of the game.<br /><br />such games have served as social "ice-breakers" for children and teens, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating to shy individuals. the film has been given this title because it deals with the teens' first experiences with crushes and romantic love.
