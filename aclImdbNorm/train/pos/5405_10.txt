my brother and i have pokemon 4ever on dvd. we watched it like a couple of times and it was the best. too bad it a new pokemon didn't talk this time. i'll get used to it.<br /><br />the iron masked marauder was pretty mean when he captured celebi with his dark ball. good thing ash and sam managed to snap him out of his control.<br /><br />there was only one song in the ending credits called cele-b-r-a-t-e performed by russell velazquez.<br /><br />pokemon 4ever became a success since the three previous films and people will always love that film.
