if you like star wars/trek, come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices. it's my top 2 favorite movies of all times, other-worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller. the intensity of the root material (shakespeare's "the tempest") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later lucas). and just because it was made in 1956, don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up. this was the first movie where you couldn't. miracle it was made at "a-movie" scale, economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it. and director wilcox's previous 'hit' was "lassie come home". until i looked him up, i assumed 'fred wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous, but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a "b" genre back then. this was either a very very visionary production, or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood.<br /><br />there are the massive-scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively. there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface'; "computers", as they've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works. star trek's 'transporter' is there, visually, almost unaltered by roddenberry 10 years later. and if the trek/wars technobabble turns you off, fp's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate, even today. the "ship" set is comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything 'trek' has done, for tv or film. we didn't get to spend as much time there as i would have liked.<br /><br />if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently, watching fp will explain all that. it's definitely not 'wagontrain to the stars'.
