in the hands of a more skilled director, this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece. despite michael "death wish" winner's merely passable direction, the movie is interesting, original and more than a little scary.<br /><br />the script bucks more than one horror clich'e off its back (several it can't shake) including chris sarandon as the heroine's boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down. burgess meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor. eva gardner is haunting with a young beverly d'angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover. john carradine does a heck-of-a job sitting in a chair. and watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown-at-the-time chris walken! this movie is creepy and creative. the plot twists are lovely, if a tad predictable. the climax, of which i will give no detail, is disturbing and quite impressive. again a better director could have done more with it, nonetheless it is quite satisfying - at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror.<br /><br />if you like modern overproduced body-counting torture-fantasy, you won't like this. there is almost no gore. the direction is quite spartan. the effects are few, although there's some delightful makeup near the end - most of which actually isn't makeup...but perhaps i've said too much already.<br /><br />i've rated this a little higher than its quality may justify, but i enjoyed it as much as any "8" film that i've seen.
