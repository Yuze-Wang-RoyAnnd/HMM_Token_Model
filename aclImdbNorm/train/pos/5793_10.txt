moonwalker by michael jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family!<br /><br />before the real story of the movie starts, we get a performance of the bad tour (man in the mirror), and it kicks off a great movie. after that we get a kind of a collage of michael carrier, as it was until moonwalker came out in 1988. after a few music videos also (speed demon, leave me alone, etc.) the story starts.<br /><br />the plot is basically that michael and his 3 friends (who are kids) are being chased by the bad guy of the story "mr. big", because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs. during the chase we see fantastic segments, fx. michaels video for smooth criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. but then one of the kids get kidnapped by mr. big, and michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict.<br /><br />during the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards, but also impressive today. for instance, see michael turning in to a robot/spaceship in order to protect his friends! it's so cool!<br /><br />the movie ends with a performance of come together (later published in michaels double-album of history), and you leave the movie with a magic feeling. amazing!<br /><br />i recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the tv. and now some parents might stand up and say: "but michael jackson is an alleged child abuser!" yeah, he is indeed, but, come on, we all know it isn't true! wait and see..
