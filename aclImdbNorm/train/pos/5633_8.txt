farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama, where she plays marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would-be rapist. well done to farrah for being a golden globe 'best actress' nominee.<br /><br />when her rapist joe (terrifically played by james russo) comes into her home, which she shares with her two roommates (who are conveniently out!), marjorie has to play along with joe's frightening demands. it does make for some disturbing and shocking images!<br /><br />when her roommates come home, they are astounded (to say the least) by marjorie's actions, and a great performance by alfre woodard who desperately tries to convince marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police, makes the film even more nail-biting.<br /><br />i do find diana scarwid quite irritating, but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all, it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed.<br /><br />overall, extremities is a brilliantly thought-out and well-acted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now! well done to everybody involved.
