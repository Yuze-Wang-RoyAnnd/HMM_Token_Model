at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple, but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film. basically forgetful ex-comedians willy clark (golden globe winner, and oscar and bafta nominated walter matthau) and al lewis (oscar winning, and golden glove nominated george burns) were a great comedy duo, and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a tv show. willy's nephew, ben clark (golden globe winning richard benjamin) is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other, how wrong he is. they cannot get on all the time, they are both forgetful, especially during conversation, but they do it eventually. also starring lee meredith as nurse in sketch (miss mcintosh), carol deluise as mrs. doris green, al's daughter, rosetta lenoire as odessa, willy's nurse and muppets from space's f. murray abraham as mechanic. i think the best line of the film is burns mentioning that matthau called him "a son of a bitch bastard". it was nominated the oscars for best art direction-set decoration and best writing, screenplay adapted from other material, it was nominated the bafta for best screenplay, and it won the golden globe best motion picture - musical/comedy, and it was nominated for best screenplay. very good!
