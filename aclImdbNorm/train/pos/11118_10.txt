the "gangster" genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody. in retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clich'es that have been utilized in it's genre, thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it. the sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it's content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance, humor and unvarnished violence. the key protagonist tony soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew ,however, tony is of two persona's one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent. with out any inhibitions or contradictions i still adamantly believe that the sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory. all things considered i could make an elaborate statement on the series, but i won't. if ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital, ambiguous, unrelenting, epic, uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you.
