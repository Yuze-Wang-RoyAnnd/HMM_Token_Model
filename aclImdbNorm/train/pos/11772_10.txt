in another one of bugs bunny's hare-raisingly wacky shorts, the famous leporid* works in a department store display case, when owner gildersleeve decides to stuff him. of course, this proves nearly impossible, as bugs apparently knows the store better than gildersleeve (and knows when to cross-dress). as always, they keep everything coming at top speed, and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first debuted! among other things, "hare conditioned" is a fine example of how the looney tunes looked in the '40s before the termite terrace crowd polished them. but don't get me wrong, the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms arrived.<br /><br />anyway, this is a great one.<br /><br />*leporids are rabbits and hares.
