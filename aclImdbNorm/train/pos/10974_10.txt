why should you watch this? there are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it! superbly and amusingly directed by albert and david maysles, grey gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of east hampton, but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two edith bouvier beales, the aunt and cousin of jacqueline kennedy onassis. their life was certainly an amusing one (edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas, edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats, one was named ted z. kennedy) the film is interesting because it is both funny and sad - edith died shortly after the film was released (in february 1977) aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and edie received after the film (she danced and sang in a nightclub edie beale jr was born in 1925 and is still living in miami beach.this film is both engaging and spellbounding.
