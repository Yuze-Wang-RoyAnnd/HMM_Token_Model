this is not only one of the greatest jackie chan films, but also one of the greatest kung-fu movies of all time.<br /><br />we've come to expect crazy stunts, and fast, creative action in chan's movies, and this one set the benchmark for others to follow. it's two hours of pure entertainment, that impresses all the way through.<br /><br />as well as the superb action, we have a viable storyline and believable characters, with chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to the writing, mixing eastern resolution methods (ie kicking ass).<br /><br />overall, it's funny, serious, entertaining and groundbreaking. a must for any kung-fu fan, whilst at the same time remaining accessible to the wider reaches of the film community.
