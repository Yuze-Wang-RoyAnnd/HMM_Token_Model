i don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here. i only saw it when it came onto cable. the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines. specifically one person, the way he gets replaced and dumped (literally) into an off-world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels.<br /><br />seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space, and would have been happy if it was.<br /><br />i'm certainly happy it was'nt - kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple. the scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment.<br /><br />this is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner, alien, silent running, logan's run or thx1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest i've seen to it in a long time.<br /><br />he changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack arnie one liners, he does'nt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy ending.<br /><br />that's why this film did'nt do well. it did'nt follow formula, and among a 18-25 year old target american audience, that's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see.<br /><br />fear and discipline.<br /><br />always.
