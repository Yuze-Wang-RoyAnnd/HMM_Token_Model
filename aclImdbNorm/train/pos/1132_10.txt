its hollywood imitating daytiem soap operas at its finest! its the fun that we never see. great characters and great lines. whoopi is hilarious.....sally field is so over the top....gary marshalls lines are a riot....this is what i love about good comedies. never afraid to poke fun at themselves!!!!!!the sets were great....wardrobe was on point and the backstabbing "montana morehead" was a devilish delight. terri hatcher as "dr. monica demonico" didn't have enough lines but none the less still gorgeous and fun when on screen. i would love to know how the idea for this movie came up. never have i seen a cast of people have so much fun in making comedy work! soapdish is a must have and i am waiting for the dvd!!!
