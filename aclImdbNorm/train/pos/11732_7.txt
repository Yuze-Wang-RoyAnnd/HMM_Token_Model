ok, i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i don't know why. i haven't seen it since, but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film - again i don't know why. but the fact that i remember it speaks volumes.<br /><br />comedy is hard - much harder than any drama. doing it right makes it seem easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? steve martin, pay attention, you are falling in this category again for some reason.<br /><br />elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly. done at a quick pace, with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn't the philedelphia story, it entertains from start to finish. brain donors is another that fits right in this category (sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes).<br /><br />one point of contention - the ending. it seems the writers/director had no idea how to finish a comedy. the ending tries to be a love story, somewhat undermining the quirky fast-paced dialogue up to that point. then there is the "tassle" scene. whereas this has to be seen (male opinion), it is so over the top and out of place it's like a shock. one more rewrite for the ending was needed.<br /><br />this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail. but if you don't try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you, you'll laugh, i guarantee it.
