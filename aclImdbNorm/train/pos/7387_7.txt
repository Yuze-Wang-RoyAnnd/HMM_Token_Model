the events of the 11th of september 2001 cast its shadow on this oscar award ceremony with a one minute silence before the in memoriam montage and there was little in the way of the all singing all dancing comedy extravaganza that we`d come to expect of this award show but this was by no means a bad thing . entertainment was more or less curtailed to a lotr send up with ben stiller and owen wilson and that was it . the rest of the show was taken up with clips from the nominations and i have to admit this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance numbers we`ve seen over the years and whoopi goldberg was by no means a bad presenter unlike the very esoteric david letterman from a few years ago and the one minute silence for the victims of 9/11 was haunting and dignified <br /><br />as for the awards new zealand was absolutely robbed . fellowship of the ring went home with four minor awards while a beautiful mind undeservingly picked up most of the major prizes except for best actor which should have gone to a tough guy new zealander but went to an an all american nice guy instead . the only oscar awards i agreed with apart from the ones presented to fellowship were the awards for best supporting actress and best supporting actor , both correct calls .
