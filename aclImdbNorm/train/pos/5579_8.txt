i had never heard of this film until i came across it by accident when browsing imdb. i saw it had gotten many awful reviews containing very colorful expletives on how much it stunk. of course this meant i had to see it. i was pleasantly surprised as whipped is actually rather a good movie. i watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had at many recent highly acclaimed hollywood fluff comedies. this is an independent film and as such portrays its subject matter (sex and dating) without the usual hollywood fakery. i distinctly suspect that people's opinion of this film will depend very much on their experience of life. if you've never dated or partied much you won't get this movie because you won't have met people like these characters. if you have, you'll recognize many of the situations that portrayed here in comedic fashion. the ending was also good, as it did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virginal romantics in contrast to many hollywood movies.
