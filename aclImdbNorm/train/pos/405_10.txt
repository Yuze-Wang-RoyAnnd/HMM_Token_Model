i've been a fan of xu ke (hark tsui) for many year since school. this film is the best fantasy movie in years. i dont think "action" is the right genre, though there're lot of action and kongfu scenese. wait, did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy moive? please, keep in mind that do not use hollywood formula to rate this film. and for the guy who "poo" around, i don't blame you, 'cause you still young and need to know more about "culture".
