of those comments here before mine, i mostly agree with edyarb's. the story and the script apparently had potential to be funny, but though managing at some points, in other places it failed. you could see them wanting to make a joke, but no one in the audience laughed. (also agree with edyarb's view on the end credits: leave it normal or make it cool, but not what they've done now.) <br /><br />ok, that gives a more negative feeling than what i actually had watching the movie. i enjoyed it; it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely didn't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket. the best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature, like luke wilson's character matt asking the super chick "p*nis or bed?" when she told him she'd "get him a new one" after a wild night in bed, ending up breaking the bed and leaving matt sore.<br /><br />i cannot, however, agree with bgs1614,who says that the film could earn an 'r' rating - there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that. some sexual acts yes, but nothing explicit, only humorous, and no nudity whatsoever. (maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more...?) i'd like to compare this to two recent films i went to see with no expectations whatsoever: superman returns and click. i didn't really expect anything from either one - i was a big fan of the original superman films and the trailer for click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic (which i wouldn't oppose) film. superman surprised me with actually having me feel good(goosebumps!) about seeing his first heroic deed, like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it. but for the rest of the story i'd rather watch my super ex-girlfriend, at least it offers some surprises. click again was a total surprise, much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie. the jokes also work much better than in ex-girlfriend, both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones.<br /><br />anyway, the only reason i compared these three films is that they are the three last ones i've seen, within a very short period, and also because i went to all of these with basically no expectations at all. i'd rank them click, girlfriend, superman.
