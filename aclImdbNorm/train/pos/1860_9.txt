i went to see antone fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised. the acting job by derek luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent. of course denzel washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing. it makes you realized that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this. don't miss this one.
