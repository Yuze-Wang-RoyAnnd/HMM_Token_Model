i'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum, and many of the reviews. i think tony scott made a good movie here. yes, it is highly stylized, flashy and over the top, but it is very entertaining. i'm glad at least ebert and roeper agrees with me :) <br /><br />this movie may not be for anyone, but if you like over-the-top, dark humor, cool action and dialog, you should see it. <br /><br />i've previously seen scott's man on fire, crimson tide and enemy of the state - all good movies, but i like this one more. it's like a roller-coaster ride, with great soundtrack selections, visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13, it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity, gory violence, and have explicit dialog.<br /><br />it doesn't hurt that keira is super-hot, and even shows nipples in this one, either...
