it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series, from one to seven. and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain. plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didn't see and i what to see it so badly like part two. it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans, which is cool, and showed the return of the puppet master from part one. it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool, it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did.so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit.
