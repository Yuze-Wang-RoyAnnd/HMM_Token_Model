i watched, entranced and mesmerized, by the vocal and physical acting. the roles each character played were done with excellence.the lyrics,the words, every gesture, the sunrise, told it all.the movie spoke to me. it enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in mankind. who believes in peace and gentle behavior. i was also held in disbelieve, by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed. power without grace, is demented and without feelings. to want power at the cost of mankind, is so unbelievable. this movie made me so afraid for the people who are no longer in this world. and, it is with sadness that i think of them. i like this movie for the conversations and face expressions to it all. may this movie be blessed.
