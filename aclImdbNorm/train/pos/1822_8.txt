an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of nimh and the land before time, this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon. i remember this very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. well it starts out a bit dark, a dog who escaped the pound, and gets killed by an old friend, ends up in heaven, and comes back. but it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons, like the dream sequence of charlie, but everything else was okay,and the songs were fair. a memorable role of burt reynolds and dom deluise, i just love that guy, ahehehe. and judith barsi of jaws the revenge, may god rest her soul, poor girl, she didn't deserve to die, but she is in heaven now, all good people go to heaven. overall this is a very good animated movie, a don bluth classic enough to put anime and disney to shame. recommended for the whole family. and know this, if you have the original video of this, you'll find after the movie, dom deluise has a very important and special message, gotta love that guy, ahehehe.
