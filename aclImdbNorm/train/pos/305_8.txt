screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city. peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture--he reveres them--yet audrey hepburn is (naturally) put a notch above the others because, after all, she's the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior. he shoots her in loving close-ups, gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled ben gazzara, and allows her room to sparkle throughout. the love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing, though i did tire of john ritter's tv-styled klutziness. colleen camp, dorothy stratten, and the grounded, earthy-sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch. but it's really hepburn's valentine and she absolutely glows. *** from ****
