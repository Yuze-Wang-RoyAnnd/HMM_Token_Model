overshadowed by "braveheart" released the same year, the two costume dramas beg comparison. i admit my bias against mel gibson, yet i maintain a rational preference for "rob roy." both "braveheart" and "rob roy" compellingly depict scots history in bloody, romantic fashion. "braveheart" is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. it's also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. note its cornball usage of slow motion filming. its violence is both ugly and glorious. it is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset. while "braveheart" surpasses "rob roy" in sheer levels of carnage (not to mention its indulgent running time), the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. its action is more understated, yet more surprising and clever. its sex is less showy, yet more erotic. "rob roy" also has a better realized romantic interest. its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period. its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era. and tim roth is a superlative villain. also recommended: "the last of the mohicans" and "the patriot." you may find the latter more akin to "braveheart" with its emphasis on blood lust, with the former more similar to "rob roy" in tone. all the of the aforementioned movies merit their r ratings for violence.
