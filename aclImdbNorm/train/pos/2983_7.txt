baseketball is indeed a really funny movie. david zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again, in a really silly, but many times smart, comedy.<br /><br />the 2 creators of south park, the main actors in this film, play very good, surprisingly good actually, but this is the first time i see them as actors. the movie oftenly reminded me of south park - one of my fav shows.<br /><br />it's a really good and funny film, so don't miss it.<br /><br />vote: 7.5 out of 10.
