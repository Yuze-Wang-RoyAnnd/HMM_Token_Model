not since the simpsons made it's debut has there been a sitcom that i didn't want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes. it has of course been said that the simpsons killed the sitcom. not this one though.<br /><br />the first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became. they even went to school sometimes. the following seasons the character where fledged out. eric, the sarcastic twit, donna, his levelheaded girlfriend, kelso, the dim bulb, hyde, the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, fez, the pervert exchange student and finally jackie, the spoiled rich floozy. as for the adult characters there was eric's mom, the "can you believe she is so ditzy" suburban mom, eric's dad, the straight arrow who of course wasn't such a hard ass as he seemed, donna's goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom. everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to kurtwood smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his red forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness.<br /><br />topher grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good. it's a tough character to play because it doesn't allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting like the kelso character, played competently by ashton kutcher. i enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different.<br /><br />hyde's character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time, although i will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons.<br /><br />jackie, played by family guy voice artist mila kunis is hilarious and she has a nails on a chalkboard type voice, which actually fits her character. the only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with her and eric because they were f...... hilarious together. too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in spades with eric and donna.<br /><br />last i will say that the casting of guest actors were always great. a few favorites: fez' humongous girlfriend in the mid-seasons, pastor dan, the totally awesome leo played by the equally awesome thomas chong, another one of fez' girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance by the teenage witch sabrina as a slutty catholic girl.<br /><br />coming up next on fox, whatever.
