i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid. i cried every time i watched it. it wasn't weird to me. i totally identified with the characters. i would love to see it again (and hope i wont be disappointed!). pufnstuf rocks!!!! i was really drawn in to the fantasy world. and to me the movie was loooong. i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them? the acting i thought was strong. i loved jack wilde. he was so dreamy to an 10 year old (when i first saw the movie, not in 1970. i can still remember the characters vividly. the flute was totally believable and i can still 'feel' the evil woods. witchy poo was scary - i wouldn't want to cross her path.
