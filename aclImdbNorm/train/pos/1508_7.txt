this movie is good for what it is, and unpretentious; i wouldn't watch it twice, however: i am a peter cushing completist and that's why i watched it. the best asset of this movie is: brevity and effectiveness. compared to other similar movies, it does not drag its feet forever as each of the four (plus one) segments lasts under 30 minutes, with the last under 10. good uncanny vibes. in the first segment, horror writer suffering from 'writer's block' relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration. he finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen. plot contrivance similar to premature burial. good use of the point-of-view twist: is the writer getting mentally ill...or (as the ending shows) his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband's phobias to drive him mad & secure his estates...yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan?<br /><br />in the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth, which had once separated them. from the gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer...or was she?<br /><br />the third segment was the less interesting to me.<br /><br />the fourth shows a horror movies actor -who thinks he's the best of all- sunken to the depths of low budget c movies. seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire, he gets the real deal. this segment also lacks the solidity of the first two.<br /><br />acting is fair, with the 2 initial segments contributing the bulk of it. good movie, taken with a grain of salt. not the best cushing, nor lee...but worth watching.
