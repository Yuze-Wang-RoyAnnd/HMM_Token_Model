i'm no big fan of martial arts movies, but the video shop was nearly empty and jet li was in lethal weapon 4 and i got it free when the other films i'd rented, either way i rented it. i absolutely loved it, my flatmate and myself (22 year old biochemistry and accountancy students) spent the half hour after the film making strange kung fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other. i can't explain it (well maybe a little tequila). i never enjoyed bruce lee, skinny bloke kicking big bloke, beating him, kicking bigger bloke etc film ends. think jackie chan with a little less comedy and more action.
