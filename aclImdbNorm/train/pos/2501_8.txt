i'm a fan of both actors/singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer,i just think this is a silly one.after a long waiting time,i watched it at last and here's my comment...<br /><br />i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it,instead of it my first applause goes to acting,generally that japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting.yet in moonchild's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it,especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well,i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones,as for hyde part,his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor,respectively as his character do,throughout the movie.i didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget,it still has brilliant moments,but the real jewel of the film is story.it has some cheesy moments but it's ok for me,and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes,on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals.an interesting note aside,this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome,beautiful)actors of american cinema,actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew,yet original on it's own.only problem that moonchild is it's a bit slow sometimes,i'm a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it's not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters.but all in all;this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes,as for actors/singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future,and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 8/10
