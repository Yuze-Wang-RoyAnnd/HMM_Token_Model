evidently, not many people have seen this movie, because no one is posting any more comments. this is not a movie to be missed. after all, it has won the george peabody award as well as the humanitas award. paul winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie. eugene logan who was a co-writer on this made for tv movie also was part of another movie on humanity, or loss of it, by being a technical adviser to truman capote's movie the glass house. this movie is now available on dvd. if anyone is interested, i will post another letter telling how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical adviser to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote. thanks for reading this and i hope you will find a way to view these two movies.
