this will be a different kind of review. i've seen this movie twice on tv and would like to have a copy because it talks about panama city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there. it was the first movie i'd seen by ashley judd and she was great and i've enjoyed every other thing i've seen her in. sundance's reaction made an impression on me too, as did the director, victor nunez, who has directed and written several movies about florida. this movie speaks to me and i've seen nothing with which to compare it. the plot speaks less to me than the surroundings. well, i told you it would be a different kind of review.
