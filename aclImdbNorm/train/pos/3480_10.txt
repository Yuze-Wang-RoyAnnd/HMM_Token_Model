this is best comedy i ever seen! but not all can understand this you must be from georgia to understand this amazing movie! :) overall one of best film i ever seen......... vachtangi(benjamin) and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of kote daoshvili (father germogel) is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films :)) in this movie playing many georgian stars like ipolite xvichia,sergo zakariadze,sofiko chiaureli,verikoan djafaridze,sesilia takaishvili,dodo abashidze.... they all are stars in georgian cinematography :) plus in this movie is playing great russian star evgeni leonov and of course director of the film georgy danelia is one of the best...... i recommending this movie for everyone but remember you must know good russian language to watch this movie
