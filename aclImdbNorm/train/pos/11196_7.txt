'one-round' jack sander is called that because he's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience. if they can last one round, they win a prize--a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago. jack is in love with the ticket girl, mabel, though her head is quickly turned when bob corby enters the ring to try his chances with jack. what no one at the fight knows is that bob is the champ, so he's able to beat jack--though it takes him some work. as a result, bob asks jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit. later, jack improves so much that he, too, becomes a legitimate boxer. slowly, he works his way up the rankings until he's nearly ready to take on the champ.<br /><br />in the meantime, the champ and mabel start running around behind jack's back--even though by now mabel has married jack. so, when the final fight occurs between jack and bob, it's very personal and jack is ready to kill him. is he good enough? will rise justifiable rage against bob help or hinder his performance? tune in and see.<br /><br />this film was directed by alfred hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery-suspense films, back in the 1920s, hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote (he did both for this film). in fact, in many ways this film is more indicative of hitchcock's silent style, as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents, the manxman (also starring carl brisson as the wronged husband). so, while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director--even with its rather formulaic ending.<br /><br />overall, while a bit predictable and having ian hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly, the film works well. while far from a perfect silent, it's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch.
