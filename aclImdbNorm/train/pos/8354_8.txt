i originally saw this film years ago during cinemax friday after dark series(back when the cable box was built like a keyboard),and it intrigued me. even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted.the performances of depardieu & dewaere are very enjoyable.they have a good chemistry together & miou-miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking.a movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times(at least not in the us), since it seems to sensationalize things like violence,robbery,& casual sex. this movie proves that with a talented cast & also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject.it saddened me to find out patrick dewaere committed suicide & in the near future i,ll will check him out with depardieu & miou-miou in get out your hankerchief.
