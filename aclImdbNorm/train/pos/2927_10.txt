this video is so hilariously funny, it makes everything else<br /><br />by eddie murphy seem very disappointing (even beverly hills cop and the nutty professor, which just goes to show you how good this really is). to be honest, i don't think that i've ever<br /><br />laughed at something as much as this, including naked gun and the rarely seen bargearse. this show is amazing, although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with f that is four letters long (plus its extended version beginning with m) but it didn't bother me. see it, the funniest thing i've ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too.
