this is one of my all-time favorite films, and while it may move too slowly for some, it's well worth seeing. a corporate lawyer (richard chamberlain) is dragged into a case involving "city" aborigines, and this is no ordinary case. ok, a man has died but it wasn't exactly a normal killing. there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately, and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive. the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans. this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about "city" vs. "tribal" aborigines, and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways. uh huh. chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what's happening, although no matter how many times i've seen this i can't quite grasp the exact connection. this is a very eerie and creepy film, and is a fine example of peter weir's ability to create tension out of nothing. the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally, it's the easiest way out and the scariest. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
