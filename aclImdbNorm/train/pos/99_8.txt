a christmas together actually came before my time, but i've been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family's christmas music. for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas. a few years ago, i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay, so after listening to all the music for some 21 years, i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself. if you ever get the chance, it's a lot of fun--great music, heart-warming and cheesy. it's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this--i guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the muppets, but i'm glad he did. even if you can't track down the video, the soundtrack is worth it too. it has some muppified traditional favorites, but also some original denver tunes as well.
