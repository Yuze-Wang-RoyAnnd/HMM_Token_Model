elvira, mistress of the dark (1988)<br /><br />directed by: james signorelli<br /><br />starring: cassandra peterson, w. morgan sheppard, daniel greene, and edie mcclurg<br /><br />plot: elvira (cassandra peterson) quits her tv show and heads to the small christian town fallwell, massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt's inheritance, hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in vegas. unfortunately for her, all she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle, and a magic cookbook. while in fallwell, elvira tries to make money, breathe some life into the teenagers, win the heart of a stud (daniel greene), avoid being burned at the stake, and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (w. morgan sheppard), who is planning to use the book to end the world.<br /><br />my thoughts: i love both cassandra peterson and her alter-ego elvira. she is a very successful, beautiful, and funny woman and as elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive, not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. in this movie, her charms are put to good use.<br /><br />i loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film. you got elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her enormous 'twins', and she's in a christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup. this also makes her love story with bob (daniel greene) a lot more entertaining.<br /><br />w. morgan sheppard is equally great as elvira's uncle/nemesis vincent, out to steal the book to use it for evil. he has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from elvira.<br /><br />what really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes. everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a scary movie sequel. i hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film, and any fan of roger corman b-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film.<br /><br />if you love elvira, you will love this flick. also check out elvira's haunted hills.
