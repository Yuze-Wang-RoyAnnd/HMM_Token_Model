having heard of modesty blaise before, but never having read a novel or a comic strip, my wife and i liked the film a lot. it delivered, in a captivating way, a good introduction to the character and her background.<br /><br />although it has some action flick elements, it is much more an intimate play, excellently written. sadly, this is also, where a major drawback of the movie is revealed. an intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered. while alexandra staden did an excellent job as modesty blaise, her counterpart nikolaj coaster-waldau - as the villain miklos - did not. smiling his way through the plot as if it is an extend toothpaste commercial, he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece. the supporting cast is somehow similar, from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from fred pearson as professor lob and eugenia yuan as irina.
