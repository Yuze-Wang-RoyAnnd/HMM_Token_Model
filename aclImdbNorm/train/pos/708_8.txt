an ok movie about downs syndrome. a mother has twins one is very sick the other is good but he has downs. the mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs! the mom does not like this & she thinks he should be with his family ( i agree too ) so they take it to court & the family gets broken up & the grandparents lose, it never really says if the mom & daughter makeup? i think this movie's good but the plot is familiar, it's still good & has a few unintentional laughs!
