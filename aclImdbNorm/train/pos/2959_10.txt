it was a saturday night and a movie called baseketball was on tv. i had always wanted to watch it but never got around to it when it was in the cinema. boy was i mistaken. words cannot describe how funny this film is, starring the creators of south park, who share a natural on screen chemistry when being funny. i taped the replay the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time, i have seen it 7 times!!. im obsessed with it, and i know anyone who appreciates trey and matts work will appreciate this movie. a must see, this is my #1 comedy of all time
