this is one of the weirder movies i have recently watched. that's because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film. kurasawa's experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences. not every episode is depressing and harsh, but overall this is definitely the tone. let's see,...we have a case of incest/rape, attempted murder, wife swapping, alcoholism, infidelity, death of a little boy after eating tainted fish, a man with severe depression (he never talks during the movie and looks very scary), a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments "driving" his street car through paths among the garbage piles, a man married to a total shrew (i think i liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist!), etc., etc. in fact, it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an ingmar bergman movie set in japan, as bergman made many movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life. is it any wonder that after making this film kurasawa tried to kill himself?! so, did i like it? no. it was not a fun experience. but, it was a very well-made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result, i really wanted to see what happened to these people. it was sort of like watching a train wreck--you don't want to see all the carnage but you can't help but watch! of all the vignettes, i think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who didn't really seem to fit in (he was too well-adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump) was perhaps meant to represent kurasawa himself. maybe. i dunno.<br /><br />if you've seen a variety of kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films, give this one a watch. however, do not make this your first experience watching his movies--it's sure to scare away many viewers!
