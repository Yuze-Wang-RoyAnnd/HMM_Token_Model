people are being too hard on the film. sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to "review" it.<br /><br />the whole thing comes together when hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down. then the fun begins as everyone about him also "go down".<br /><br />just think jfk and all the people associated in any way with his assassination, who's lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you'll appreciate what is implied in this film.<br /><br />i think it's an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred. though the exact story line my not have been followed (hindsight here after reading jim maars "crossfire") but it's what is implied that is of interest.<br /><br />i'd love to get a copy of it to view it again. in light of what is known today, the domino principle is right on.
