just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative (though exceedingly predictable) writing. sean connery is an anti-death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man (blair underwood) from the ultimate penalty. to set things right, connery ventures to the scene of the crime, where he must contend not only with the passage of time, but a meddling sheriff (laurence fishbourne). twists and turns and role reversals abound -- some surprising, some not -- as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery. the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous, but just cause is worth a look on a slow night.
