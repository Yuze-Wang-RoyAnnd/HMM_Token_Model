so we compromised. this was a fairly charming film, i liked the art direction (it felt far more "real" than most kids movies), and the costumes weren't too cutesy. the child actors were not bad to watch (the adult performances trended toward cheesy). it was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullying.<br /><br />i don't know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves, but it's a great film to take a kid to. and since "barnyard" was apparently attended by 100+ kids at the same time, i'm really glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of "worms" instead.
