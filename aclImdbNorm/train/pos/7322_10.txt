halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep! it is in my opinion, the scariest movie of all time. michael myers is the best boogeyman ever! he was just so terrifying! what makes halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is, this was on a low budget and had a one note score, yet managed to scare the hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78.<br /><br />it's about a boy michael myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution. dr. sam loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back, since he describes michael as "...pure evil. the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes". michael is on a mission though, to kill his other sister, laurie, played by a new jamie lee curtis. she has to babysit on halloween, while her friends are out partying and of course, we know the rules, they get it! but laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin. ;d <br /><br />halloween pays many homages to psycho, we have another character named sam loomis and jamie lee curis, the daughter of janet leigh. halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors, bolt your windows, and turn off the lights! "they're gonna get you! they're gonna get you!". halloween, the ultimate horror film! <br /><br />10/10
