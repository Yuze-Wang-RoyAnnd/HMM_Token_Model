i saw this movie when it came out when i was 17 years old and into classic rock (still am)... <br /><br />i never liked opera before because i hate soprano voices, but he changed all that. he was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice. <br /><br />i heard on cnn that he died tonight at home of pancreatic cancer, he will be missed, and he definitely left his mark on this world.<br /><br />i hope to buy this movie if i can find it, watch and enjoy. *smile* maybe i should head over to amazon.com and have a look before it's sold out.
