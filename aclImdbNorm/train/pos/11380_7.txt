although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe gene kelly, and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff, you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show. in american in paris, he choreographs some outstanding numbers, some which stall the plot, but are nonetheless amazing to look at. (check out gene kelly's "getting out of bed routine" for starters)<br /><br />gene kelly stars as a gi who is based out of paris, he stayed there to paint, soon he is a rich woman's gigolo, but he really loves someone else! hoary story sure, but the musical numbers save the show here! i really loved georges gu"|tary's voice work in this one. his 'stairway to paradise' and his duet with le gene on 's wonderful' is 's marvelous'. oscar levant and leslie caron i can take or leave. all in all, a pretty good, but not dynamite movie.
