it's been quite some time since i've watched this lotr. i am currently hunting for a copy to purchase. bakshi's work is quite true to the original work. the visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting.<br /><br />drawbacks? occasionally, the movie is confusing or muddled. there are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl. but, overall -- buy this movie. it's great for kids, adults and collectors.
