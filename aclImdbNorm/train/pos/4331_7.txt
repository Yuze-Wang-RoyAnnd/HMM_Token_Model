murder in mesopotamia, i have always considered one of the better poirot books, as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending. there is no doubt that the tv adaptation is visually striking, with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score. as always david suchet is impeccable as hercule poirot, the comedic highlight of the episode being poirot's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and hugh fraser is good as the rather naive captain hastings. the remainder of the cast turn in decent performances, but are careful not to overshadow the two leads, a danger in some christie adaptations. some of the episode was quite creepy, a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as five little pigs, an episode that i enjoyed a lot more than this one. what made it creepy in particular, putting aside the music was when louise leidner sees the ghostly face through the window. about the adaptation, it was fairly faithful to the book, but i will say that there were three things i didn't like. the main problem was the pacing, it is rather slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens. i didn't like the fact also that they made joseph mercado a murderer. in the book, i see him as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer, and under-developing that, made him a less appealing character, though i am glad they didn't miss his drug addiction. (i also noticed that the writers left out the fact that mrs mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer's next victim.) the other thing that wasn't so impressive was that i felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of amy leatheran, like it was in the book, amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation. on the whole, despite some misjudgements on the writers' behalf, i liked murder in mesopotamia. 7/10 bethany cox.
