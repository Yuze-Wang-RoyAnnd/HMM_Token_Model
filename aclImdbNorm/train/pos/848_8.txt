the turning point in "the matador" comes about half through the movie when danny, an unsophisticated man from denver, is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel, enjoying a quiet moment. someone knocks on his door, and knowing it's julian, the paid assassin, he refuses to answer. but did he really? <br /><br />richard shephard, the director of "the matador", presents us with a character, julian noble, who shows no redeemable qualities. in fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. when julian meets danny at the bar of the camino real in mexico city, he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living.<br /><br />danny, who has come to sell his program to a mexican company, but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract. danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter julian. it's not until some time later, on a cold winter night that the killer appears at danny's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to tucson. it's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way.<br /><br />pierce brosnan, acting against type, makes a great contribution with his irreverent julian noble. just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character. greg kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this odd couple. hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn't she stay longer. philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignments.<br /><br />richard shephard directs with style working with his own material. the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything.
