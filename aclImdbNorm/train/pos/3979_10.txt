i would just like all of the fans of this documentary to know that martin torgoff is my uncle and i am so darn proud of him. this mini-series that in shown on vh1 is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it. the amount of time and effort that i have watched him put into this documentary and the book that started it all (can't find my way home) makes it that much better to watch him on tv. i know that he loves what he does and he does it well. his eloquence is shown in the interviews, which he did himself, and the amazing additions that he himself adds to the commentary. from the music to the videos and everything in between, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it. i appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it (or didn't) and would love to hear from fans! three cheers for uncle martin!!!
