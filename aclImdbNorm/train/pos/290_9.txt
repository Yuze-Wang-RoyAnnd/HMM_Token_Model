edmund burke said that "all evil needs is for good me to do nothing." hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films. this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith. it had no violence, no lewdness, and did not deserve a pg rating. the western scenery was filmed well, and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking. actors were a bit young for their parts, but otherwise believable and talented. music score was too loud, and in some places drowned out the dialog completely. i'm seldom surprised by movie endings any more, but i was pleasantly surprised by this one. sometimes the good guys do win, and they win by honest efforts. we liked the movie and the message, and would recommend it for the entire family.
