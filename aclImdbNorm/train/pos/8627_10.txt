my god ! buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies i've ever seen. closer to peter greenaway and jean-luc godard's movies, this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks. all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive, in spite of the lack of money (see the "bridge" sketch). highly highly recommended !
