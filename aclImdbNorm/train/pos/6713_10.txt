i liked this tv show because it was it's own thing a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and her she lives with her aunties in the house and they are both witches as well. well this took her about a few weeks of getting used to. when she used her powers for the first time it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. she had to turn back time and repeat a day. this series is really cool and it is a typical teenage series but it wore thin when she moved out of her house and to an apartment with her fellow college friends and then it got boring and i stopped watching.i loved her aunties they were so funny and the other one was really ditzy. i loved valerie and i hated sabrina's enemy libby she was ugly.
