guns blasting, buildings exploding, cars crashing, and that's just the first ten minutes. <br /><br />this action-packed film involving a rogue ex-cia mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. <br /><br />tough and toothy gary busey, usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks, has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued: after all he's carrying the entire show. which doesn't mean there isn't a lot of terrific supporting roles including william smith, luke askew, mills watson, r.g. armstrong, henry silva, lincoln kirkpatrick, thalmus rasulala, and several other "forgotten" character-actors. <br /><br />there's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story: busey has to free a group of "kidnapped" american military elites and return a high-tech "supertank" (a normal tank with a cheesy add-on pasted to the top) back to the states. <br /><br />but does america deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys? this question is asked, of course, like in any film centering on the cia... but without getting preachy.
