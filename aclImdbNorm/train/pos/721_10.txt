rock n roll high school holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the ramones. i was too young during the band's mid-70s heyday to be very aware of them, although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. i finally saw rnrhs on television one afternoon in the mid-80s when i was about fifteen years old, and laughed all the way through it. (isn't it every high school kid's dream to trash his school and blow it up, all set to a rockin' soundtrack?) i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again, thinking "man, these guys kick ass! i have to check out some of their albums!" the rest is history. twenty years, umpteen ramones lps/cassettes/cds, and three ramones shows later, they're still one of my all time favorite bands and rnrhs still cracks me up every time i watch it. now that joey, dee dee and johnny have left us (r.i.p. all)at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by.
