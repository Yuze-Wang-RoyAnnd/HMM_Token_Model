i'm a bit conflicted over this. the show is on one hand awful, the acting is terrible (even when we get actual name actors like brad pitt and bill moseley in one episode), the dialogue is moronic and the premise/moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short. there's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes, and robert englund's cameos are short, pointless and corny in a sort of a bob saget on america's funniest home videos kind of way.<br /><br />on the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television. the 80s fashions, the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of the view at all times, the premises lend the material more to self-parody than scares, so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his sat's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him, another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a substandard mom (her husband is played by brad pit), another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home, another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially-retarded twin, another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step-dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house. the list goes on and on.<br /><br />being that these are dreams i suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices, but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience. you have characters dressed like something out of a 80s-themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point (typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it).<br /><br />if you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away. if you're looking, on the other hand, for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever. watch it.<br /><br />its been showing on chiller tv lately (pretty much every day) and i've been watching, earlier out of morbid curiosity, and now just so i can get a good laugh in each day. with arrested development and extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now.
