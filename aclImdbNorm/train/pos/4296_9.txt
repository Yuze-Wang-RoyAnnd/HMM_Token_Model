this would have been my number one movie of the year for 1991, except it got beat out by the brilliant jfk. this is such a wonderful movie! i loved it. i love stories where different characters' lives intersect with others and how deal with their lives. kevin kline is good here, but is outshined by danny glover and, especially, steve martin. i've never much like martin or his style, but here he is great. i loved the whole speech he gave to kline near the end about the grand canyon. the writing was excellent. larry kasdan is, imo, a great dialogue writer, along the ways of kevin smith and quentin tarantino. here, he has formed several three-dimensional characters and well thought out storylines, and messages that give a positive feel to our lives. a truly excellent film. 4 out of 4 stars
