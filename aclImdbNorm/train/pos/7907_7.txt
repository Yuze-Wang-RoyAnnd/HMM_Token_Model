i could not agree less with the rating that was given to this movie, and i believe this is a sample of how short minded most of spectators are all over the world. really... are you forgetting that cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it only entertainment? this movie is not entertainment, at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like titanic or gladiator. it has style, it is different, it is shocking... that's why most of you have hated it so much: because it does not try to be pleasing to you. it's just a story, a very weird one i admit, but after all, only a weird story. it is not a great story, not even a great cinema work, but i believe it is worth a 7-stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience, thus selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer. this movie is, for me, european-artistic-like movie made in the us, and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect. be it for the courage, or be it for the unique sense of humor.
