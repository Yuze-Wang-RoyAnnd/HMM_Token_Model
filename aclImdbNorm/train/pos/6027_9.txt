i was told it was one of those "either you love it or you hate it" movies. well, i loved it. obvious hippie-era, dated and easy symbolism and all. so, i probably have no taste at all when it comes to antonioni, but this and la notte (made exactly a decade earlier) are my favourites among his movies so far. made two years before i was born, zabriskie point was supposed to have been michelangelo's great american epic. but apparently, it turned out to be a flop. i really can't see why. before watching it i'd read that it was rather boring, so i braced myself for a very slow movie - though i love me a slow movie. for my taste, zabriskie didn't have a tedious minute in it. while watching it, i made a mental note of how european it was on the director's part to make such frequent use of advertisement billboards in almost every urban scene, enormous billboards dwarfing any human form in sight. this recurrent visual element is obviously there to underline the way that consumerism crushes the individual in american society. but then i watched l'eclisse straight afterwards, which is set in rome in the early 60s, and noticed that antonioni often included billboards in it as well. after all, the masterful use of landscapes, architecture and inanimate objects in each frame with or without human beings is an antonioni trademark
