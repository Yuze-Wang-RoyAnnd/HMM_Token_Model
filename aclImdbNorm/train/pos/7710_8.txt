when one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white b films that were parodied on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show. yet, while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films, the 1950s did have some very good, if not great, science fiction films like the day the earth stood still, the incredible shrinking man, invasion of the body snatchers, war of the worlds, and the thing from another world. yet, the best of the bunch, for its literacy and production values, was undoubtedly mgm's first big foray into a level science fiction, forbidden planet, released in 1956. it was a 98 minute color film, directed by fred m. wilcox, that featured then state of the art special effects, and was endowed with a very good screenplay by cyril hume, from a screen treatment called fatal planet, by irving block and allen adler, who adapted aspects of william shakespeare's the tempest into it.<br /><br />the film drew raves when it was released, for its oscar nominated special effects, its all electronic music score, by louis and bebe barron (although credited as electronic tonalities, to avoid music guild fees), vivid matte paintings- inspired by chesley bonestell, and the famed monster of the id (moti), which was animated by an animator, joshua meador, on loan from the walt disney studio. even more famous was the appearance of robby the robot, in his first role in either film or television. later he would appear in the film the invisible boy- included in this dvd as a bonus, as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone, night gallery, and lost in space- with whose own robot he is often confused, and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film gremlins.<br /><br />the tale is simple, but elegantly constructed, and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced 'love story' aspect in the film. in the 23rd century, the united planets cruiser c-57d- a flying saucer, led by commander j.j. adams (leslie nielsen- yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days), is en route to the planet altair iv, to investigate what happened to the crew of the bellerophon, sent to the planet twenty years earlier. after a year's journey, there they encounter the lone survivor of the party, doctor edward morbius (walter pidgeon), the prospero stand-in- a philologist, his gorgeous blond daughter altaira (anne francis)- the miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt, and robby the robot, the domestic servant who is the calibanian counterpart. morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the bellerophon party in their first year, yet he was immune to it
