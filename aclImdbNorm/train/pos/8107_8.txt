with such actors as ralph richardson, raymond massey, cedrick hardwicke, and margaretta scott, how can you go wrong. very unusual scenics, especially the modern ones. the realization of the modern machinery is very effective. here you have ray-gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area, so new structures can be made. although she's much younger in this film, it's not very hard to figure out who the future mrs. pumphrey from the bbc series, all creatures great and small is going to be! really effective "reappearance" of both raymond massey and ralph richardson. the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer, artur honegger and it is also unusual. for the time (1936) it looks like they used really, large sets or the effects make it seem that way. lastly, it's a really good story.
