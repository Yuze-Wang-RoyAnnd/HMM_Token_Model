i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. for instance, the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could "hollywood" just throw in a token gay character in the movie. and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great. one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top. and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters. for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible. but i guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad. but if you're more open-minded and i don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film.
