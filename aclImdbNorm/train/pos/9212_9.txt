yesterday, i went alone to the cinema, because here in mexico, most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called "cam'ara alternativa" (alternative camera). but after i saw this movie, i realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative. afortunately, this is a good a example. but i have to said that i enjoyed so much this movie.. that at the end i was happy.. this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days. and the main lesson for me.. is that at the end of the day...the love is main force behind us. this is a good option to see a good movie in spanish...and i have to mention the good music.. specially the main song of the movie.. cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena.... excellent song!!!
