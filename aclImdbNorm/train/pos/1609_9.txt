"moonstruck" is a movie that i liked the first time i watched it. i really liked it the second time. i loved it the third time. now it is one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />the humor is subtle but really good. the film offers a lot of warmth humor. the story takes place in a old school italian neighborhood in nyc. cher's search for love is enjoyable to watch. this film is, by far, the best job nicholas cage has done on film. the old man character is fantastic. he lights up the screen without saying a word. the scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic. but, perhaps the best character is the one played by olympia dukakis.<br /><br />the film's climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen. exceptional direction and wrap up.
