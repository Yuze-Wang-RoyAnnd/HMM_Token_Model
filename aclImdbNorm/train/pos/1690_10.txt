i found the memorable quotes searching for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites...<br /><br />old person 1: you know, i remember the first time they played that thing. <br /><br />old person 2: you remember pterodactyls. <br /><br />old person 1: and i can remember you fell for that, hook line and sinker. <br /><br />old person 2: oh, i did not. <br /><br />old lady: you did so. you put a big bucket on your head and took off with them army boys to fight martians. <br /><br />old person 2: ain't you dead yet?
