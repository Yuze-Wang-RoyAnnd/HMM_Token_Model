i remember this film from many years ago. certainly the best film on the subject in my experience. the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact. <br /><br />it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier. but they were nonetheless very powerful.<br /><br />this subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years. and it was most effectively treated here, with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism.<br /><br />i wish it would be shown on tv at least once. or at least be available on tape or dvd. or is it? is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it??
