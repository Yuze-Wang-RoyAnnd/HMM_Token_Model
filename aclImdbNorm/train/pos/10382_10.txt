as with all the other reviewers, this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story. i even wrote to the pbs station for more information. despite all this, all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s.<br /><br />fastward to 2002, after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was, a vhs copy of the movie. there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie. the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her. despite owning a copy, i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie. you can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/harvey%20perr/war%20widow/war_widow.html
