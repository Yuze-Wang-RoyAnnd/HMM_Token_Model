i happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels. my expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie.in 'a guy thing', jason lee plays paul, a straight-laced, seattle-based fellow who is about to marry his fianc'ee karen (selma blair) and settle down to an unchallenging life of middle-class domesticity. we first meet paul at his bachelor party, where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his (surprisingly few) buddies encourage, in case he's a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and strife. of course, the next thing paul knows, it's the morning after the night before, he's in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother-in-law phones to inform him that karen is on her way over. oh, and the hula dancer is karen's cousin becky (julia stiles).<br /><br />from this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune, as paul scrabbles from misadventure to misadventure, trying to cover up what he's done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a dutiful, family-oriented good guy, who's super-excited about his forthcoming nuptials. his efforts to ensure karen remains none the wiser about any potential wrong-doing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the fun-loving becky, forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been mapped out for him. the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance. definitely worth a watch.
