robert taylor and stewart granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in "all the brothers were valiant". taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad-guy role but granger plays his part perfectly. however the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest. the film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given. the direction is taut and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment it is, to my way of thinking a major film, unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti.
