yep, you read that right, kids. michael bay should've studied this film before making either of his over hyped, overlong, overly pointless "transformers" movies. "robot jox" is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the "transformers" crew spent on megan fox's personal trainer.<br /><br />thankfully, this little robotic gem, initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert band's empire pictures studio, seems to have developed a cult following over the years. i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the cold war-era politics/stereotypes were already out of date by that time (just the bands' luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released, eh?), it's still a pretty damn cool little b-movie. they really don't make'em like this anymore, or if they do, they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportions.<br /><br />for those who are unfamiliar, here's the robo-scoop: we're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust, large scale "wars" have been outlawed. disputes between nations are now settled mano-a-mano (or perhaps that should be machine-o-machine-o) by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots. whichever 'bot walks away from the fight wins for "his" side. gary graham (who would later go on to play detective sykes in the "alien nation" tv series), plays "achilles," the greatest robot jock in marketplace (a.k.a. the good guys) history. achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts (ten being the maximum number of battles before a "jock" is retired) and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the "confederation" (i.e. the russkies!), the psychotic alexander (who is the most over the top "evil russian" stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgren's infamous turn as ivan drago in "rocky iv"). the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles, but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain. a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout, but achilles simply wants to bow out, hang up his helmet and move on with his life. rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more, i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns, behind the scenes skullduggery, and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow "jox" before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale.<br /><br />i hope i'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction, because it isn't. "robot jox" is just plain fun. i'll grant that it is a bit higher-concept than your average b-grade sci-fi movie, and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known (especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green-screen trickery), it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empire/full moon pictures factory. the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion/model techniques, and the sets and costumes don't look half-assed in the slightest. empire pictures and director stuart ("re-animator") gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture. unfortunately it didn't quite pan out for them (or the studio) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal. bottom line: if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2+ hours, feel free to rent a "transformers" movie. by the end you're likely to feel like you've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game. if you want to have a rock'em, sock'em robot good time, pick up robot jox instead.
