let's start this review out on a positive note -- i am very glad they didn't decide to wimp out with tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were rumoring. actually, creator and writer of this episode david chase did quite the opposite. we don't actually know if tony will live or die. he's in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none. this episode seemed to move very slow, and the coma induced dream tony was in involving mistaken identity and robed asian monks slapping the sh*t out of him was absolutely, flat-out weird. after 45-minutes i got a little sick of everyone grieving, but that shouldn' t be a reason to slam this episode. it was a weird and unpredictable episode, but it was still well-written and intense. edie falco gave an astounding career-defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husband's could-be demise. i also found it interesting aj dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against junior, which aj most likely won't have the balls to pull off. silvio is now acting-boss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes. there were a lot of great quips in this episode, also, and i think vito 'pole-smoker' spadafore may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy s.o.b.<br /><br />this wasn't a great episode and disappointed only because even though tony kills people, we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show. this was a necessary episode for the series, even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion. kudos to edie falco's performance, and david chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist. this is the only season of 'the sopranos' where i haven't a f*cking clue where it is going to go. i can't wait for next week's episode. my rating: 7.5/10 <br /><br />best line of the episode: (paulie to aj): "let's go, van helsing!"
