well no, i tell a lie, this is in fact not the best movie of all time, but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody i know has seen.<br /><br />it's a buddy cop movie starring jay leno and pat morita(mr miyagi) with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something, but that doesn't matter. the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads, who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends. the whole culture difference thing is done quite well,in that it's fun to watch, it's completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way. the soundtrack is cool,once again in a cheesy 80's kind of way, it suits the movie, i've been trying to find one of the songs for ages, but as i'm working from memory of what i think a few of the words were i can't seem to find it.<br /><br />another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever, but i won't give that one away, oh no! in conclusion i'd take this movie over 48 hours\most of eddie murphys output including beverly hills cop, and whatever buddy junk jackie chan or martin lawrence have to their names. if you're looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with "straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop" give this a shot. you might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with "straight japanese cop meets zany streetwise white cop".<br /><br />i'm giving this 7. to be honest i like it more than that. i'd rather watch this than a lot of stuff i'd give 8. but i guess i know deep down that it's some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie.
