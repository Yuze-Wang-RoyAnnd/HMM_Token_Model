this is the most confronting documentary i have ever seen. it was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of china, edward burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore.<br /><br />taking no political sides, this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about - the by-products of economical growth, the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser-developed communities, the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer lifestyles.<br /><br />amazing, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore. this is a challenging journey but one worth taking - please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues. 10/10 definitely!
