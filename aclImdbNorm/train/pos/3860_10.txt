in holland a gay writer gerard (jeroen krabbe) gives a lecture. he stays overnight with a beautiful woman christine (renee soutendijk) and has sex with her (by imagining she's a boy). he plans to leave the next day, but gets a look at a picture of christine's hunky boyfriend herman (thom hoffman) and decides to stay to have a try at him. then things get strange.<br /><br />a big x-rated art house hit in the us in 1983. why was it x rated? let's see...there's strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!! paul verhoeven made this after "spetters". "spetters" was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash. so, verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it. he was right! critics loved the film not realizing that verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. still, it's a great film. <br /><br />it's beautifully shot by jan de bont (now a director himself) and there's so much symbolism and obvious "hidden" layers in the dialogue that you're never bored. all the acting is great--krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but (somehow) has you rooting for him; soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection--the little smile she gives when gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body--he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with krabbe in the crypt.<br /><br />this is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart, but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! a 10 all the way.
