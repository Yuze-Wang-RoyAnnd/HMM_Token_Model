i had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night, with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing. i suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death. i have had many such losses, and this movie spoke to me. one of the major themes is how we don't deal with questions/issues/stories with our loved ones until it's too late--they're too incapacitated or dead before that happens. talk to your loved ones, listen to and record their stories, tell people you love them, resolve differences. i loved the message that there are no mistakes. i love the director's portrayal of the relationship of the two daughters--as one of six siblings, it's clear to me he understood how complex those relationships are. his history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear--what a beautiful movie! the casting is outstanding--a film not to be missed!
