i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out.<br /><br />since i had already seen the original, when i saw this on sci fi channel- i don't know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi - i knew what it was within the first few minutes. since i like richard burgi as a character actor, i wanted to see how he would pull it off.<br /><br />the writers/producers etc, modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the "aliens" (they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help) using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90's. maybe it added a bit of polish to the film, or not.<br /><br />this film. film? this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did- the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place, although no resolution of the alien's problem.<br /><br />i sort of remember that in this remake, the woman became rather hostile towards the burgi/alien- i think it could have ended better. but the ending is just the ending, and the yarn is a swell yarn, being of the basic 1958 science fiction pulp stock. many great science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some of them even made it to film.<br /><br />this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something. i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50's sci fi, this one came off well. i actually enjoyed this quite a bit.<br /><br />but if anyone really wants to see this story told well, i suggest the original 1958 version with tom tyron and gloria talbott, directed by gene fowler jr.
