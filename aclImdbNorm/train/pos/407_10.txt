o my gosh... just give me a minute to breath. this movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesn't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending. this is the the movie for fans of stormriders and such. legend of zu was beautifully created, although i didn't like a few things, they used alot of stand ins. i wanted to see the real person fight but, oh well... a few small let downs,and i didn't really like it a lot until i watched it again, when you understand it more it totally kicks a**! i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie, to see this movie. i give this movie one of my highest ratings.go and see it when it comes out in america!!!
