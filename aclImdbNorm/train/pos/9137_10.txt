this is the only movie i've seen prince in but it don't matter. and i thought he was only great at singing boy was i wrong. this is probably his best performance. the music is great. thats why it won the oscar in 1984 for best music to a movie (or something like that). now he has an oscar and grammies under his belt. although the cursing gets in the way with the film (just make sure no little kids or in the room). there isn't to much to say without revealing the plot. you should really go out and get this movie your collection isn't complete unless you got this movie in it. what else could i possibly say except for go and get this movie now!
