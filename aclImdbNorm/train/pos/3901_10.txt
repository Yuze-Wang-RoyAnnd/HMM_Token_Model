this video rocked! eddie is one of the funniest comics i have ever seen. not only does he have class, he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that i have ever seen. eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic i've seen in a very long time. tell all those other stand-ups to get off the stage and let this "executive" reign!
