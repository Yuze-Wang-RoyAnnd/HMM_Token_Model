after playing a nymphomaniac in written on the wind, dorothy malone finally said good-bye to her sweet sister/wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them. she and gloria grahame played the same sort of tramps--and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role, malone won a best supporting actress oscar.<br /><br />the film she's in is not quite up to oscar standards, but it is a strong enough melodrama under douglas sirk's capable hands. there's an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has rock hudson, lauren bacall, robert stack and dorothy malone as its headliners.<br /><br />domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama, with the accent on the strong supporting players, stack and malone. both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and stack, too, should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak, alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives.<br /><br />the nominal stars have less impressive work to do, but do it with their usual skill and conviction--hudson and bacall. they play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding.<br /><br />the use of color is particularly striking (as it usually is in a sirk film) and yet it doesn't preclude me from thinking of the film as a technicolor film noir in the vein of leave her to heaven.<br /><br />well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast.
