i'm giving ten out of ten it's one of the best movies ever. absolutely smashed, stunned and dazed by the whole picture, marvellous playing of jason statham, ray liotta and all the crew, amazing plot... just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit-it touched your soul, because it's strange, but there are all the answers you've been ever looking for... the very best, mr. ritchie! the very best ever. those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed. but there are lots of shallow movies in hollywood nowadays, you can't remember what it was about the next day you had seen it. on the contrary, revolver is unique, i could have hardly expected it's possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself, of everyone who was to watch it. absolutely unsurpassed, astounding, dazzling... one can get insight watching this, i have no doubt about that. actually, no words can express my admiration... i'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy hollywood rubbish we had been watching. thank you from all heart, it's simply the best.
