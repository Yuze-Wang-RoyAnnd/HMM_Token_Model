this film is one of tom cruise's finest films. he captures the audiences imaginations with his role of david aames. his character can relate to us all in some way.the story line is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film. i never really watched cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent. my favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth. if you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try. it's one of those films that once you've started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it. my opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk thats what i did and it became one of my favourite films of all time. it's a* 10/10 i promise once you watch it, it will stick with you and you will like it forever.
