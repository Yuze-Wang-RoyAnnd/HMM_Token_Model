i went and saw rivers and tides again today. it's the second time in two days and yes, i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary. yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthy's works. this morning when i threw the coins i received #29 the abysmal (water). goldsworthy has an affinity with water, hence the title. i received the 5th line changing which moved to #7 the army. to blake art was a war. anyway, i knew i had to see the film again.<br /><br />i read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner. the critic loved the film but said goldsworthy's comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film. he'd rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack. so i was aware of that as i watched this second time.<br /><br />yesterday i thought that i'd vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world. well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say. could i enjoy the film without his comments? what he is doing, what he is saying goes way beyond "art". his understanding of water, time, stone, change, and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar. some of his work/words are zen like. his knowledge...<br /><br />anyway, the film is only (apparently) being shown here in the bay area. be a trend setter. go to your local cinema and tell them, no insist that they have to book a film you've heard about from the hinter lands. it's called rivers and tides.<br /><br />
