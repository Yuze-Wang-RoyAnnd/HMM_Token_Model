a number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak. she was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. i think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like vertigo, but it does matter for a romantic comedy. we can easily understand, that is, why his character would be attracted to hers, but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his.<br /><br />still, the movie works as a light romantic fantasy. the scene where she stares at him across the cat's head, with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring, is true magic. it's a little jarring, therefore, when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building, and we see the age difference very sharply. as he embraces her, she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair, but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee.
