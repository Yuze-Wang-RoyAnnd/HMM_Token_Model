reviewed at the world premiere screening sept. 9, 2006 at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival (tiff).<br /><br />this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.<br /><br />the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship. still, what was there was interesting. the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking. the opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well. scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khang-je films at tiff (the feature still life/sanxia haoren & the documentary dong) which were also built around that subject.<br /><br />director jennifer baichwal, producer nick de pencier, cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a q&a after the world premiere. producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself.
