i don't see how you can say that freddy's nightmares is cheesy and a rip-off. you obviously don't know good tv when you see it. the episodes are packed with drama and blood. freddy is creative in the way he kills people. i love freddy's nightmares and i hope to get all 44 episodes on dvd. the best episodes are: saturday night special,school daze, and love stinks. if you think this series sucked then you're entitled to your opinion but remember it's only your opinion and it means nothing. freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you'll come to accept that fact soon enough. if you don't like it then don't watch it but don't deny it's brilliance.
