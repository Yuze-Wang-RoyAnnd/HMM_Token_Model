the melting man...a tragic victim of the space race, he perished melting...never comprehending the race had long gone by...!<br /><br />a man (burr debenning) burns his hand on the kitchen stove. but instead of screaming something a normal person would scream, he shouts something that sounds like "aaaaatch-kah!!" this movie you've popped in...isn't a normal movie. you've just taken your first step into the incredible melting man, the famous late-70's gore film featuring rick baker's wonderful makeup effects. baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar, and did this at the same time as his famous "cantina aliens" in star wars. for some strange reason, star wars became a household name, and incredible melting man did not. <br /><br />it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind-numbingly awful. from the opening credits ("starring alex rebar as the incredible melting man"...that's really what it says!), to the chubby nurse running through a glass door, to the fisherman's head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks, this film provides many, many moments of sheer incomprehensibility. "why did they...but how come he...why are they...?" after a while, you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is--a very entertaining piece of garbage.<br /><br />an astronaut returns to earth in a melting, radioactive condition; he escapes and, his mind disintegrating as well as his body, begins a mad melting killing spree. the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped, but (probably not wanting to "cause a panic") want him captured as quietly as possible. so they send one guy with a geiger counter after him. wow.<br /><br />storywise, surprisingly little happens during the movie. the melting guy wanders around killing people. a doctor searches for him with a geiger counter. various characters are introduced, ask questions, and leave. eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man, but is shot by a security guard for no reason, after he explains that he's "dr. ted nelson." the melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo. the end.<br /><br />it's so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun, despite a fairly downbeat ending. supposedly, a widescreen dvd release is planned. a very special movie.
