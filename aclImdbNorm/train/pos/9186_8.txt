troubled men's magazine photographer adrien wilde (well played with considerable intensity by michael callan) has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models. when the lovely ladies start turning up dead for real, adrien worries that he might be the killer. writer/director william byron hillman relates the engrossing story at a steady pace, builds a reasonable amount of tension, delivers a few gruesomely effective moments of savage misogynistic violence (one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake in it placed over her head rates as the definite squirm-inducing highlight), puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn and engaging true-to-life characters, further grounds everything in a plausible everyday world, and tops things off with a nice smattering of tasty female nudity. the fine acting from an excellent cast helps matters a whole lot: joanna pettet as sunny, charming love interest mindy jordache, james stacy as adrien's macho double amputee brother b.j., seymour cassel as adrien's concerned psychiatrist dr. frank curtis, don potter as adrien's feisty gay assistant louis, pamela hensley as gutsy homicide detective sergeant fountain, cleavon little as a hard-nosed police chief, and misty rowe as sweet, bubbly model bambi. r. michael stringer's polished cinematography makes impressive occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots. jack goga's ominous rattling score likewise does the trick. popping up in cool bit parts are robert tessier as a gruff bartender, sally kirkland as a saucy hooker, kathy shower as a fierce female wrestler b.j. grapples with in the ring, and frances bay in one of her standard old woman roles. a solid and enjoyable picture.
