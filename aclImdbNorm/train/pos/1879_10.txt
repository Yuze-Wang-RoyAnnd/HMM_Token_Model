i was too young to remmeber when i first saw this movie. but i saw it for like the second time about 7 years ago. my sister told me i had to see it. now my whole family has it memorized. we quote it at least once a day. i absolutly love this movie.i still laugh after all this time. sure, it's about a really, really drunk millionare that is irresponsible. the whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie. and that he is willing to give it all up for love. i highly recomend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. a lot of laughs. its hallarious, sweet, and if your a movie buff, it will truely change your idea of "funny". watch it with a group of your friends or your family and i promise, you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some authur lines in your head. it will make you laugh for years to come.<br /><br />it is really hard, in my family, to find a movie that everyone likes. but this movie, i feel, made us closer. and i know it will do the same for you!!
