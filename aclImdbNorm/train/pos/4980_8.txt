while browsing the internet for previous sale prices, i ran across these comments. why are they all so serious? it's just a movie and it's not pornographic. i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it. i've shown it to many of my friends & they all loved it too. i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known. after reading the other comments, i agree that the film is "racy". big deal! i only wish it was longer. it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals, for sale at least, so i wonder how much it's worth?
