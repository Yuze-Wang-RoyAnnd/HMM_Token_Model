a chinese ghost story stars the late, great leslie cheung as ling choi sin, a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted temple, where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called tsing (joey wang). when ling discovers that tsing is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil tree spirit who feeds on 'chi' (life force), he decides to try and free the girl by giving her remains a proper burial. enlisting the help of swordsman yin (wu ma), a crazy taoist monk, ling successfully defeats the tree spirit, but must also do battle in hell against the evil lord black, to whom tsing is due to be wed.<br /><br />the first hong kong film that i saw which wasn't purely martial arts action, a chinese ghost story opened my eyes to the incredible world of asian fantasy horror, a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts, bumbling innocent heroes, sword wielding taoist monks, monstrous spirits, and dark lords of the underworld; i instantly fell in love with the film's exuberance, energy, humour, inventiveness and visual excellence.<br /><br />two decades later, and this amazing movie still remains one of the finest examples of its genre that i have seen
