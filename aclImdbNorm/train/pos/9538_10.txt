why aren't more films (especially american) more like meatball machine? <br /><br />this is my first official on-line review and i am charged with "electrical ecstasy" after having chosen "meatball machine" as my first endeavor. this is a review, so i'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion.<br /><br />i mean, this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic tetsuo! so what if it's not all original? i own both of these films and though tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch, meatball machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance. meatball machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore. thank you jesus for japanese cinema!<br /><br />simply put, the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching nightmare on elm street when i was 7 or so. i could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end. this time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring.<br /><br />in this film human bodies are host to aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood. humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!! there's more!!! fight scenes!! great music!! great point-of-view shots! decent acting by the woman cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). the fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times.<br /><br />oh, and did i forget to mention it's a love story! wow, i hate love stories but this takes the cake!<br /><br />i can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces. sadly, i took time to write this review because i'm afraid most friends and family wont understand meatball machine. the truth is america as a whole is not prepared for meatball machine.<br /><br />lastly, my wife walked in while i was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless. normally she says something like "why are you watching that junk?" this time she had nothing to say. i was glad! <br /><br />this is not junk. this isn't just splatter (splatter for the sake of splatter is also great). this is art my friends. art.<br /><br />chacho
