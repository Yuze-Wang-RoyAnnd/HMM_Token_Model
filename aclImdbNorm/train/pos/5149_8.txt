this is a tepid docu-drama that covers no new ground, reworks all the cliches and is sloppy with facts. for example, munich is a very flat city. so why is it hilly in the movie? for example, the end of the great war in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice. yet it is announced as a surrender. for example, european news vendors did not (and do not) shout headlines as they hawk their papers. yet this strictly american custom is employed in the film. for example, the nazis did not adopt the german eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the lectern as hitler delivers one of his stem winders. indeed, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than hitlerian oratory. the movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the munich hoffbrauhaus. it was not. robert carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject. but his supporting cast is adequate at best and very often not even that. these comments are based on the first episode only. one only can hope the second will be better but don't bet on it.
