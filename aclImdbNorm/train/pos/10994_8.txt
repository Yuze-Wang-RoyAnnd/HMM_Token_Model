this is my first comment! this is a fantastic movie! i watched it all by luck one night on tv. at first 5 minutes i thought it was a b movie, but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was.<br /><br />i suggested to some friends to see the movie, only to tell me that it was a bad b movie. how wrong. superficial critiques.<br /><br />i think that the movie is almost a product of genius! the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time.
