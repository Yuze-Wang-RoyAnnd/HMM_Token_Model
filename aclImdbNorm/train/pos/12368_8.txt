i had the tv on for a white noise companion and heard" $400 for a fully furnished apartment" so i ran into the tv room expecting another 70's flick and got much more. luckily, i could rewind to the beginning (dvr buffer) and hit the record button to watch it entirely.(cinemax uncut and in hd no less!) aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog/events, this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. pretty creepy and progressive at times: beverly d'angelo's character masturbates in front of alison parker, played adroitly by cristina raines, parker stabs, in very gory fashion, her father, an explicit menage a trios scene.( don't let the kids watch) the film is totally 70's full of bad clothes(polyester suits and tacky ascots) and decor, bad hair,over bloated music score, and familiar looking cinematography. the cast is excellent, take a second on this film's home page to check it out.it was a surprise to see christopher walken, jerry orbach and jeff goldblum so young. sylvia miles- always wonderfully creepy! enjoy!
