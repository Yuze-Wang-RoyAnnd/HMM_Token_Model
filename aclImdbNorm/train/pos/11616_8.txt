i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well: viewed from an israeli perspective, i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie. what i would like to say is that 'distortion' was shown at a film festival in geneva in november 2005 (festival 'cin'ema tout 'ecran') where it won the award of the audience ('prix du public'in french). for what affects me, i liked the 'nervous camera' work of mr bouzaglo, who, in my opinion, portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well, and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie. this perspective, however, might seem totally 'alien' to an israeli viewer, but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers, because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack. it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in geneva judged this film with a much more 'detached' perspective.i would also like to quote what mr bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a geneva newspaper (i'm translating from french): ''after 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence, we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal.we might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living. we are like the characters in my movie,''on the edge of the edge''. this is the reason why the private detective, who is somehow ''voyeur'' is the happiest character in the movie, because he earns a living thanks to the system, he takes advantage of this situation'' this is, in substance, the main thing that i and the swiss public, in my opinion, pointed out in this movie, and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor. so, to sum up, different country=different perspective, but i think that this is somehow great, because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema, that is to say that it well never be subject to a 'unique' of 'formatted' way of thinking.
