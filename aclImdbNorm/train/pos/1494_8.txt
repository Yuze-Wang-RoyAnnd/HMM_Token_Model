a classy offering from amicus, producer milton subotsky and director peter duffell ('the far pavillions' etc) turn in a classy, intelligent 'four-hander' with a strong cast (peter cushing, christopher lee, jon pertwee, ingrid pitt etc) all giving stylish performances, despite a low budget which results in a few 'un-special effects'. the most outstanding contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old chloe franks who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold. only spoilt by the lurid title wished on the film by its distributors, this underrated release, a cut above the run-of-the-mill 'blood 'n' guts' shocker movie, is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror.
