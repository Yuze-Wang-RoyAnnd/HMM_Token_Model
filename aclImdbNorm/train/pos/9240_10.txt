found this flick in a videostore, it cost $2 to buy. the whole movie stinks really bad! the so-called colonel, who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted, must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk. he nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world. then the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense given the old man's inability to do anything worth mentioning, a now two terrifyingly eighties-looking guys take over, in what must have been some sort of story. i got lost a hundred times but didn't mind, because the movie is so bad, it's real fun to watch. zero-budget trash with actors not deserving that name. go check it out!
