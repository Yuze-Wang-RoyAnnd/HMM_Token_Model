this film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. it -is- sad, because aids in the early '90s -was- sad. but its real message is one of love and perseverance.<br /><br />mark and tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of aids escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming.<br /><br />when "silverlake life" was originally released, i was deeply involved in hiv/aids education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an hiv/aids clinic. the film spoke to me like no other aids film of its day could, because mark and tom were real people, living the very experiences that i saw on a daily basis in real life. i knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch aids eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to mark and tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. it touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.
