"the odd couple" is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation. people all know it, they hum the theme song, they complain of living with a sloppy "oscar" or a fastidious "felix"...but they're under-selling the film without knowing it. this isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy; it's a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce. it's also damn funny from start to finish, but it's the kind of comedy that arises from realistic, stressful, and just plain awful situations. so, some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable, but i think its verisimilitude is its strength. besides, matthau's bulldog face just cracks me up! my favorite comedy, by a country mile.
