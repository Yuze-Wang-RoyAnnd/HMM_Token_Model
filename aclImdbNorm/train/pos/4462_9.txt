one of the first of the best musicals, anchors aweigh features several memorable musical sequences, such as kelly dancing with jerry the mouse, kelly dancing with 7-year-old sharon mcmanus, sinatra singing with jose iturbi playing piano, kathryn grayson singing with iturbi conducting, and much more. the technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath, through transparent keys, and grayson singing, seen through the finder of another camera. the plot is thin, but you get involved from kelly's & sinatra's enthusiasm. sailor's on leave, they have to take home a runaway boy (dean stockwell) and sinatra falls for his aunt. to set him up with the aunt (grayson), kelly suggests that sinatra can get her an audition with jose iturbi. but sinatra's young and naive in this one, and in his own sung words falls in love too fast. while they're trying to contact iturbi, who's never available, he starts to fall for another girl (barbara britton); but kelly's now falling love with grayson. anchors aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live-action / cartoon sequence with tom and jerry, but there's a lot more here that's worth a look. i'm giving it nine stars because, while it's not quite as good as the best musicals - singin' in the rain, the music man, oklahoma - it is one of the first of their class of technicolor big productions (perhaps meet me in st. louis was the first), and better than most others.
