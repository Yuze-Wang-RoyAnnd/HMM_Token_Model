there's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece greystoke. once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly dull, tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor, and romance. maureen o'sullivan is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie. weismuller is solid as well. highly recommended.
