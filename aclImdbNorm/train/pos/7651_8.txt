an interesting tv movie based on true fact, betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters, that of a prisoner. giovanni ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for his brother's death penalty. but when he goes to visit him and enters elias koteas, the problem starts. it has nothing to do with koteas' acting ability. he just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to "g.q." magazine, with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. this realization came to me after meeting again an old friend, whom i had not seen for almost 15 years, which he spent in several panamanian jails. the young man i used to know is gone, not only because he is older, but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the penal system. there are jails and there are jails, one must say, but this one prisoner in "shot in the heart" is definitely out of this world.
