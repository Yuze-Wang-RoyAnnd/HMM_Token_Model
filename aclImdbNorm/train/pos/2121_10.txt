this is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players. it will make you laugh and it will make you cry. the very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time. if you want to see a great movie, this is it. jimmy stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and frank morgan as mr. matuschek is spellbinding. morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing. william tracy as pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances. felix bressart delivers a fantastic performance as perovitch, a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with. it is a simple story of how close co-workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances.
