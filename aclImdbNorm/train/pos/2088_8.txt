from the upper shelf of great classic books, comes this masterful story written by pearl buck. the book like the movie is called " the good earth." it relates the story of wang lung (paul muni) a simple chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the 'great house' where he has taken a slave woman called o-lan (luise rainer) and made her his wife. almost from the beginning, she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. during the following years, o-lan proves her worth by steadfastly sharing her husband's toil, troubles and changing fortunes. through the passing years, they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and famine. indeed, it's at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of companionship, loyalty and love. with the changing times, their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives, like their uncle (walter connolly) who is a scoundrel and charlatan, but is compassionately tolerated. wang has his 'old father' (charley grapewin) to advise and remind him of life's fragile and fickle nature. two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are keye luke who plays wang's elder son and phillip ahn who plays a nationalist soldier. the film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel. highly recommended for all audiences. ****
