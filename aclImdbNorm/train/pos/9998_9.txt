seeing as the vote average was pretty low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was "just ok", i didn't have much expectations when renting this film.<br /><br />but contrary to the above, i enjoyed it a lot. this is a charming movie. it didn't need to grow on me, i enjoyed it from the beginning. mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character, i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies.<br /><br />there's not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that, but there are some rather hilarious scenes, and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film.<br /><br />very recommended.
