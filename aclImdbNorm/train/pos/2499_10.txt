this film was amazing. it had an original concept (that of a vampire movie meets yakuza mob film). it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship, love, immortality, death, and happiness, and comments subtelly on society. on the part of gackt camui, the role of sho was excellently delivered, and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire, kei. i also laughed and cried at the happy-go-lucky character, toshi, who grew up with sho. i loved each and every second of this this film, especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene, the fighting scenes, and most of all, the heartrenching ending.
