"homeward bound: the incredible journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets. deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general, together with other animal movies like "old yeller", "napoleon", "fluke" and "air bud". this means it is more than just a movie about pets.<br /><br />can this possibly be just a "remake"? it is too good to be a "remake"! i know this one by heart, since my early teen years (when i was 12).<br /><br />it's a family movie to treasure. it's emotional, thrilling, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, heartwarming and sometimes dramatic. it's one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films.<br /><br />this movie does not lack qualities. it has a well thought story, enjoyable characters, excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, dazzling sceneries/landscapes of the magnificent sierra mountains (in oregon). speaking of the vistas, it's not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets... in conclusion, all of pure nature's wonders - truly a full panorama. <br /><br />the main human characters are nice, well developed and well portrayed by respective actors. robert hays is awesome as the kind-hearted dad, bob seaver. kim greist is good as laura burnford. veronica lauren is equally good as hope. kevin chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother jamie (his appearance actually reminds me very much of kevin corcoran in "old yeller"). benj thall is great as peter burnford.<br /><br />when it comes to our quadruped pals, shadow is my favorite. shadow is the loyal, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old golden retriever (brilliantly voiced by don ameche). chance, the american bulldog, is the opposite of shadow. he is carefree, silly, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play (voiced by the talented michael j. fox). chance just can't stand still. sassy is the epitome of cats's image: elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm. sassy is a seal point himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. sassy is voiced by sally field, who also does a good job.<br /><br />our four-legged friends are, themselves, great "actors" by nature: ben as shadow, rattler as chance and tiki as sassy.<br /><br />it's an underrated movie, but a classic by its own right. its sequel is clearly inferior.<br /><br />this should definitely be on top 250.
