if you have any kind of heart and compassion for people, this is a tough movie to watch, at least in the second half of it. <br /><br />it's in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded (mentally- challenged) man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child. it's not pleasant material.<br /><br />however, it's a good movie and the acting is good, too. the story will sit with you awhile.<br /><br />"dominick" is the mentally-disabled guy and is played by tom hulce. i think this might be hulce's best role ever. he's looked after by a med student, "eugene," played by ray liotta, who became a star the following year with kevin costner's "field of dreams."<br /><br />dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads "hulk" comic books and loves wrestling. he's the type of "slow" guy that you can't help but love and root for to live a happy life. when he freaks out, it's for several good reasons and...well, see the film for the whole story. it's worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see.
