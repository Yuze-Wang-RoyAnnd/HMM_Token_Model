los debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who have moved to santiago from the south after their mother dies. the confident and streetwise silvio, the elder brother, gets a job working for a sleazy strip club's owner after taking the naive victor there for his 17th birthday.<br /><br />as silvio blossoms under his boss's tutelage, both brothers get involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress, gracia. as the film unfolds, characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and overt ways that each one manipulates the next.<br /><br />the film is well made, with good cinematography and fast pacing. it's also pretty sexy, with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes. it uses the now-popular technique of layering different scenes from different points of view, out of chronological sequence. many people hate movies like this because they don't understand what's going on - memento, pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, and many other good films use this device. the plot itself is really nothing new, there are elements of body heat, pulp fiction, and many other good film noir.<br /><br />as the different layers are revealed, our understandings of the characters and their motivations evolve. while the plot may be somewhat clich'e, it is also clever and entertaining.<br /><br />i would call it an enjoyable movie, worth watching, but nothing memorable. i haven't seen many films from chile, and it's always interesting to see film noir from other countries. other than that, rent it if it's available but don't lose any sleep if it isn't.
