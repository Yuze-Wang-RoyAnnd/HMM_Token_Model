the performance of every actor and actress (in the film) are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again. however, i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors' and director, attenborough's credits that puzzles me: aren't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent, long lasting film for the audience? i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one (possibly one of the "knowledgeable" personnel (insider) of the film.
