yesterday i watched this movie for the third time. it was recommended to me by a fried several weeks ago. i never watched or even noticed it before, because it falls (so typically) in the category "swedish movie" and those who rose up (like me) with hollywood productions tend to be sceptical of any foreign movies. hell what a paradigm shift! the film touches me, because it just keeps up my hope, that mankind can change to a better way. the swedish village is just a pattern for all areas on earth where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, disguised brutality, but also the ability to have fun, to meet, to sing... it takes a trigger from outside to rip off the masks of everyone (who keeps one) and to let them feel that we all are just human beings with the desire to live our own lives. i can never stop to see stories like this, because, that keeps up my hope as described above. the five minutes containing the story of gabriella's song including her performance is one of my movie-highlights ever! thank you kay pollak just for these 5 minutes, which made me happy!
