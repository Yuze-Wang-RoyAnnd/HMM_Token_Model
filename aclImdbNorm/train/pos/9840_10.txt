born again the limerick: <br /><br />if a man could come back from the dead <br /><br />and live in a little girl's head <br /><br />revenge he would get <br /><br />for the murder he met<br /><br />by the guy that's now in his wife's bed.<br /><br />for me born again is a highly under-rated, classic episode that makes up a part of what defined the x-files for me before i started watching it. i saw a few segments before when the show first came on and i was much too young to watch it such as parts of the jersey devil, but i very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. i tell you i couldn't sleep for weeks! for this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that i have since grown to enjoy. its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge. or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. you'd think her parents would have been worried. and maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story. and was was with the telekinesis? other than adding the really cool carrie factor to the already creepy story, there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it. but even with its little flaws, in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it. 10 out of 10.
