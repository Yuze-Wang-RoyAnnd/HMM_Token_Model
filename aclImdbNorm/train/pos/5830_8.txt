the boys are working outside a recording studio when they hear "the voice of an angel." that would be miss van doren, auditioning and going under the name of miss andrews because her father doesn't approve of her being a "radio singer". however, she hopes a certain big-wig, mrs. bixby, a friend of her dad's will hire her, and then he will have to give his approval.<br /><br />she leaves but within minutes the boys are running amok in the studio causing havoc and having other musicians out to kill them after they ruin the recording session. finally things calm down. "whew, we eluded them," says moe. "yeah, we got away, too," answers curly.<br /><br />the boys then fool around in the studio, put on miss van doren's record and curly gets dressed in women's clothes and pretends he's singing. mrs. bixby walks in, is impressed and hires "seniorita cucacha" on the spot! for an extra $500, she's asked to come and sing at their high-society party that night. the rest, as they say,is history as curly pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results. oh, by the way, he accompanied by "senior mucho" and "senior gusto."<br /><br />what happens at the party is simply that the truth wins out, but not before a few slapstick antics take place. in all, a pretty good episode. i enjoyed it but wouldn't rate it as anything special.
