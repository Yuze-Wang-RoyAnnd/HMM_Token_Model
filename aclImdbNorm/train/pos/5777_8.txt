a meteor crashes into crater lake, the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch.<br /><br />alright, so the plot is just trash. but despite its obvious low budget, this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster-on-the-loose films in existence. there are also some good moments of humor. in an age filled so-called 'monsters' which are no more than laughable men-in-rubber-suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces (cheap exploitation-style), it's refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent harryhausen-style stop-motion creature.<br /><br />quite a hard film to find, but it's worth finding.
