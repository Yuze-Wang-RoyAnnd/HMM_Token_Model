an insomniac's nightmare is the story of a man's plunge into insanity. having chronic insomnia, jack is plagued by hallucinations; causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn't.<br /><br />we find out interesting things about jack near the end, and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a "happily ever after" hollywood ending. wrong. this is new york city, the place where nobody sleeps.<br /><br />tess nanavati (writer and director) has herself a good film in 'an insomniac's nightmare'. a talented filmmaker and writer (she made this film right after her high school graduation), she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future.<br /><br />as i watched this short film i was constantly uncomfortable; between the music, bleak scenery, and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by dominic monaghan (as jack), i desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it.
