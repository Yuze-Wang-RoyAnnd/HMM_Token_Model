anna (charlotte burke), who is just on the verge of puberty, begins to have strange dreams which start affecting her in real life--especially involving a boy named mark (elliott spiers) who she meets in her dreams.<br /><br />very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments. despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a pg-13 rating, this is not for children. also, if you hate fantasies stay far away. but if you're game for something different this fits the bill.<br /><br />well directed by bernard rose with a just beautiful music score and a few nice, scary jolts. the only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is burke--she's not a very good actress (it's no surprise that this has been her only film) and it hurts the movie. however, everybody else is just great.<br /><br />spiers is very good as mark; glenne headley (faking a british accent very well) is also very good as anna's mother and ben cross is both frightening and sympathetic as anna's father.<br /><br />a sleeper hit when released in 1988, it's since faded away. that's too bad--it's really very good.
