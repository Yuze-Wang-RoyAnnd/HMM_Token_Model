clint eastwood reprises his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante (sondra locke)who is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk, not that i'm complaining. sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment.
