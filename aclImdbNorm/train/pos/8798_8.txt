first than anything, i'm not going to praise i~narritu's short film, even i'm mexican and proud of his success in mainstream hollywood.<br /><br />in another hand, i see most of the reviews focuses on their favorite (and not so) short films; but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line that circles the whole compilation, and maybe it will not be so pleasant for american people. (even if that was not the main purpose of the producers) <br /><br />what i'm talking about is that most of the short films does not show the suffering that wasp people went through because the terrorist attack on september 11th, but the suffering of the other people.<br /><br />do you need proofs about what i'm saying? look, in the bosnia short film, the message is: "you cry because of the people who died in the towers, but we (the others = east europeans) are crying long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you".<br /><br />even though the burkina fasso story is more in comedy, there is a the same thought: "you are angry because osama bin laden punched you in an evil way, but we (the others = africans) should be more angry, because our people is dying of hunger, poverty and aids long time ago, and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you".<br /><br />look now at the sean penn short: the fall of the twin towers makes happy to a lonely (and alienated) man. so the message is that the power and the greed (symbolized by the towers) must fall for letting the people see the sun rise and the flowers blossom? it is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been proposed by an american. there is so much irony in this short film that it is close to be subversive.<br /><br />well, the ken loach (very know because his anti-capitalism ideology) is much more clearly and shameless in going straight to the point: "you are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces, but we (the others = latin americans) suffered at a similar date something worst, and nobody remembers our grief as the whole world has done to you".<br /><br />it is like if the creative of this project wanted to say to americans: "you see now, america? you are not the only that have become victim of the world violence, you are not alone in your pain and by the way, we (the others = the non americans) have been suffering a lot more than you from long time ago; so, we are in solidarity with you in your pain... and by the way, we are sorry because you have had some taste of your own medicine" only the mexican and the french short films showed some compassion and sympathy for american people; the others are like a slap on the face for the american state, that is not equal to american people.
