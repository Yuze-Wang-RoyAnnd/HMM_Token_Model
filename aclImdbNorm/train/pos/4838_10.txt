this movie reminded me that some old black & white movies are definitely worth the look.<br /><br />initially i had some reservations, however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated. i was very impressed with the mixture of drama, suspense & comedy.<br /><br />arthur askey (tommy gander) is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole time.<br /><br />definitely add this movie to your movie-night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and "too" powerful or overly "funny" movies of today.
