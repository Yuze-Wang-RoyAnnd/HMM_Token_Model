oscar-caliber performance by peter falk in an oscar-caliber-written role. i loved the nuanced, balanced exploration of a long-time marriage - how often do we get that in films, where usually the movie ends when boy & girl get together? this is a movie for adults, a complex view through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story. on top of that, it gave me about 10 major belly laughs, and i'm one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing. this was one of the few truly funny movies i've seen. great, original jokes.
