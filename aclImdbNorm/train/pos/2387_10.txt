i have a six month old baby at home and time to time she fights sleep really bad. one morning she was having a particular difficult time getting to sleep when the doodle bops theme song came on t.v. she stopped crying almost instantly, and for the rest of the show was content. i sat her in her bouncy seat and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms, and actually laugh at this show. the kept her entertained and happy the entire time. i also got a video of them so that at times when my little one is flustered i have something to calm her. granted, late at night if she awakes with colic to fuss the doodle bops are not her cup of tea, but they sure do come in handy when i need a little time to do housework,etc. the biggest surprise about the doodle bops is that my child doesn't even like watching t.v. she'd rather be in the floor playing with a toy or with our small toy poodle than watch t.v. yet, the doodle bops have totally captured her attention. i don't know if she will continue to like them in the future but for now she's attached.
