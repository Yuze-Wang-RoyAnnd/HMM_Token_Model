the movie took a new angle to gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was. his relationship with harilal is something that gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.<br /><br />my big gripe is that i thought gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. it could have been better acted by the person who played gandhi. some of gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />the movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. the rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.<br /><br />overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
