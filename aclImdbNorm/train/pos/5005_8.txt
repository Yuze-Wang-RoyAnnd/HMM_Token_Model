with films like "wallace & gromit" and "chicken run" under their belt, the good people from the other side of the pond, aardman animation, are now introducing us to a bit of their twisted humor in the form of "creature comforts".<br /><br />derived from a short done early in their careers, "creature comforts" is a slice-of-life show where snippets of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort.<br /><br />aardman animation went across the country interviewing people with innocuous questions such as, "are you a liar?" and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives.<br /><br />the answers, while seeming to be boring and mundane, are actually quite funny, when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later.<br /><br />how many of these animals look like the person making the statements? one of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman, "i like them kind of thin." is an insect, the walking stick.<br /><br />there are two dogs discussing odors and smells, while sniffing the behind of a poodle, as they talk about the different smells of a woman.<br /><br />there are two birds in a cage. as the "wife" tells the litany that is her health, her long suffering husband stands by her, saying nothing.<br /><br />while it might take some time for "creature comforts" to find it's "legs", it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary. while there are more reality shows than carter has liver pills, "creature comforts" is one of a kind and definitely worth watching.<br /><br />some of the humor might seem a little racy, it's the claymation that catches the attention of the children (like the old batman series of the 60's, the jokes are subtle enough the kids won't get them) and it's the jokes that are there for the adults.
