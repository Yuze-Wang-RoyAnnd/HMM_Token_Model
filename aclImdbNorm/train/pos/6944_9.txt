for anthony mann the western was 'legend'- and 'legend' makes the very best cinema! mann's work was full of intensities and passions, visually dramatic, and the action always excitingly photographed...<br /><br />stewart, a docile actor with the ability of displaying anger, neurosis and cruelty, made with anthony mann, five remarkable westerns: "winchester '73;" " bend of the river;" "the naked spur;" "the far country;" and "the man from laramie."<br /><br />in "winchester '73," stewart reveals his darker side... he offers all the reserves of anger, inner ambivalence, and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had, up till this time, failed to catch...<br /><br />a carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style: shelley winters is at her saucy best; dan duryea perfect as the vicious, sneering psychopathic villain; john mcintire great as the unscrupulous character; charles drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor; and a very young rock hudson, attempts the role of an indian chief... <br /><br />"winchester '73" is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized, rifle in the dodge city kansas of 1876... stewart and his estranged brother, who bears another name (stephen mcnally), compete fiercely for possession of it, and though stewart wins, mcnally steals it and sets off cross-country with stewart in pursuit... what gives the pursuit an element of the demonic, is stewart's determination to revenge his father's death at the hands of that same renegade brother
