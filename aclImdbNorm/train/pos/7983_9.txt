it's hard to top this movie in several ways. everything works really well here; the casting, acting, script, and cinematography are all first-rate. for the moviegoer, it's a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. for the film critic, there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit. there are some tactical blunders, and as has been discussed on the boards, the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the cia agent training angle. however, i took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the cia agent's pragmatic approach, creasy basically commends his soul to the ultimate without considering the consequences. like jesus himself, creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not. in any case, i appreciated the fact that creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent. <br /><br />in any case, this film is very much worth watching if you're at all attracted to the genre. an excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting, and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 (or better) film.
