i must say, i thought i had seen it all. i am an extremely jaded movie buff. this movie didn't shock me, by any means. i'm way past that point. but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn't know i could go to. i had no idea i could ever find (ick) the idea of beastiality erotic. never never never. ever. ever. but there you go. he did it. i have to give the director credit. he pulled it off.<br /><br />for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore. we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex. after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn't a mistake. then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married. then some nervous guy shaves. then we see (briefly) a hot chick getting it on with a butler (but this is very brief). at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake. in fact, i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night.<br /><br />we finally get the good stuff when a girl (who knows who she is, or who anyone is in this movie) has a dream about a victorian-era gal being ravaged by a beast-thing in the forest. the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat (heh-heh) of the whole deal. it's beautifully shot, superbly edited, and does deliver the goods. they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn't either. oh well. i would definitely recommend this film. the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (and my tv) but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it.
