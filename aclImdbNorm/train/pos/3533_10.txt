sadly not available on dvd as yet, but worth pursuing on tcm or vhs. a secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. a movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which i will mention! the jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in hollywood history, despite being at very low budget and made during wwii in black and white. despite the low budget - long island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision. ella raines was a great actress discovered by howard hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - joanne dru, hepburn, angie dickinson, lauren bacall, ann sheridan - of their era. robert siodmak was of one of several german, hungarian & czech film-makers - sirk, wilder, zinnemann, lubitsch, curtiz,lang, etc - who 'emigr'es relocated to hollywood, and brought a highly original fresh vision with them. sadly ella raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.
