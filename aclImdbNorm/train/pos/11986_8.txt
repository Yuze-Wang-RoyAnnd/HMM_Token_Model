i watched 'speak easily' one night and thought it was o.k., but missing something. maybe buster keaton strangely speaking threw me off, or the labored line delivery of a leading lady. the next day i kept thinking about the movie, though. i couldn't get durante's song out of my head, i kept trying to better remember thelma todd's first scene, i considered that maybe keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy. the next night i watched a scene with thelma todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress buster and jimmy with her sex appeal. a very funny scene, the actors excellent, their faces, their eyes, their silly expressions. so i watched another scene, their show is opening on broadway. buster in his blissful innocence botches every act. again, i was laughing out loud, appreciating keaton's clowning and tumbling. so the next night i watched the whole movie again, and this time i see it for the first time: it's stupendous! it's sensational! it's sublime! three great comedians! todd dances! durante sings! keaton speaks! sure it ain't poifect...but there's a lot of laughs in this picture.
