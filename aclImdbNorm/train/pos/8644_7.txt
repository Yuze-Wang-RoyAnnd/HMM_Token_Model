**** = a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten<br /><br />***1/2 = a classic in time; simply a must see<br /><br />*** = a solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece<br /><br />**1/2 = a good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws<br /><br />** = may still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)<br /><br />*1/2 = mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile moments<br /><br />bomb = not of a viewable quality<br /><br />- kalifornia = ***<br /><br />- unrated (for strong violent material, considerable sexuality, and language)<br /><br />i rented this film expecting an in-your-face summer-blockbuster-quality celebration of brad pitt's face, but was happily surprised and disappointed. this really is more of a drama, and very grim at that... i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voice-overs.<br /><br />pitt plays out his possibly un-sexiest film ever with startling talent. who started out as a hopeless yet harmless "white trash" husband became realized as a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind. during some of the latter stages in the film, i found it hard to keep watching him - he was unpredictable and scary. this proves very good writing and acting.<br /><br />the whole movie is filled with bizarre, sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once, and i don't mean action scenes. i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing. it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death. again, i am very impressed with the screenwriter(s); whoever they are did the impossible: mixed oil and water.<br /><br />i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis's performance. it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy. some of her moments in this film brought me to tears. i mean that. the emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible, and i clearly remember getting blurry-eyed on a few occasions.<br /><br />i almost feel like i'm cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving "kalifornia" a *** rating. but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it. i do believe that everyone should see this movie though. i truly do.
