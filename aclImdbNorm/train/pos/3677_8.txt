thankfully saw this on a plane to singapore recently (thought i'd missed it at the cinemalaya filmfest). paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 mins each) by 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary paris.<br /><br />one of my fave segments is 'parc monceau' by alfonso cuarn (great expectations, harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban), which was done in one continuous shot and features nick nolte.<br /><br />the coen brothers' 'tuileries' starring steve buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious ! juliette binoche and willem dafoe in 'place des victoires' was haunting.<br /><br />for maggie gyllenhaal as an american actress/druggie in 'quartier des enfants rouges' to have portrayed anticipation and heartbreak in such a short period of time was just brilliant.<br /><br />elijah wood as a vampire victim in 'quartier de la madeleine' was pretty surreal, while emily mortimer and rufus sewell played a cute couple in wes craven's 'pre-lachaise'.<br /><br />natalie portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired french boy in 'faubourg saint-denis'. but despite the many portrayals of young love, a more mature execution by gena rowlands in 'quartier latin' was equally aww-inducing.<br /><br />this movie is perfect for those with adhd because each sequence is driven and carefully thought of.<br /><br />there are also a number of memorable quotes. one in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days: "in pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love."
