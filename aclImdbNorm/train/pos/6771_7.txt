so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i definitely remembered. i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame. but frankly i like the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now. i thought it interesting that belisario's airwolf and jag have similar theme - the lead actor (hawke and harm) both are looking for an mia relative (brother, father). wonder if robert belisario's personal life mimics these 2 shows' theme.<br /><br />question - does anyone have pictures of hawke's cabin. i love that cabin (kinda like a dream cabin of mine) and that is one of the scenes i remember about airwolf.
