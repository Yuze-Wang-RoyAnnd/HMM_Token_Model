i used to love watching "sabrina, the teenage witch" friday nights on abc's tgif. i think this was one of the best shows on tgif. my friends and i used to get together every friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode.<br /><br />my favorite character was salem. he was adorable and sooo funny. i liked sabrina's boyfriend harvey, too. he was hot. i think melissa joan hart played a good teenage witch, too. my favorite episodes were "sabrina through the looking glass" and "hilda and zelda: the teenage years". those episodes were great.<br /><br />overall i really miss this show. i hope one day abc brings it back with new episodes. i give this show 10/10 stars.
