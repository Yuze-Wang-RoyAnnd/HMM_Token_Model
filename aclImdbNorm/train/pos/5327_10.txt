as a knowledgeable fan i recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted. as an 11 year old living in istanbul i heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream. i thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be crap. my only records until then were haley mills, the everly brothers & ricky nelson. soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in ismir i heard a song (which i later learned was 'love me do') and was floored by the difference between it and every song i had ever heard until then. when i heard the 'meet the beatles' album of my older brother i was hooked for life. having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by davis) i was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine). >
