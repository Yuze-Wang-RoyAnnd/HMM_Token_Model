there's something about every "hammer" movie i see that really takes me into a new fantasy world. in the world of "hammer" movies, anything can happen. "guardian of the abyss" is one of those types of movies. it adventures deep into the occult and hypnosis to bring a different type of horror fantasy. all in all, an unforgettable movie. 7.5/10.
