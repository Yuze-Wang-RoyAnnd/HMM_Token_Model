for those of you who have read rohinton mistry's highly respected novel, this film will definitely impress you, because of how honorable an adaptation it is . with the exception of one minor subplot, sturla gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead-on recreation of the book (down to the last line).<br /><br />for those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little tricky. it is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. instead it has a strong element of realism to it, but i would not have it any other way. the best way to describe such a long journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, hindu version of 'fiddler on the roof'. instead of a jewish/russian milkman, the protagonist gustad noble is a banker in 1970's bombay during the time of the muslim/hindi war with pakistan. he is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. the ending is not a happy one, nor is it a sad one, but that is essentially what realism involves. <br /><br />such a long journey is a fine little movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. unlike the novel, it has received very little release.
