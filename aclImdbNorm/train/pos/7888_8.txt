freddy krueger the dream stalker from elm street returns,the great character actor robert englund is back in this sequel of nightmare 5, dream child.i hope i got the number correctly.there's been so many,and this one is one of the best,especially for the cameos by;rosanne barr (then arnold)tom arnold,johnny depp,(who did the very first nightmare in 84)alice cooper(singer)you will see freddy as a tormented child,a teenager who loves pain,and as a family guy(creepy)the effects are very funny and creative,the cast also includes lisa zane(billy's sister) breckin meyer(road trip)yaphet kotto(alien,live and let die)and amanda donahue(father knows best)i was one of the people 3who saw this in 3d,well the ending.i love 3d movies.i missed the first 3d wave in 1953(i wasn't even born yet)the second wave was in 1983.i like all the freddy movies.this one stands out as one of the better ones not counting the first which was absolutely brilliant,freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s,along with jason voorhees,chucky,micheal myers,and leather face.can you imagine a film with all of them?i recommend this to all freddy fans and horror fans alike.that freddy is such a cut up.8 out of 10.
