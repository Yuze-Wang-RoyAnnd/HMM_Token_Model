i just caught an episode about brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started. i have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart-breaking than his drug addiction. here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arriving he insults lance armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who ever lived, and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general. understandably, he is soon asked to leave. most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what i wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass?<br /><br />at any rate, i was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows brad at the height of his addiction. we see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. i didn't even know that was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that? do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good tv episode?<br /><br />at any rate, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives. sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although i have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean-cut. there are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe i should warn about spoilers here, everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the end, and i have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life. but still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about something like that
