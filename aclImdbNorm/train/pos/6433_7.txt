several posters have quoted renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing ingrid bergman smiling to camera. the short answer is wouldn't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so. at this stage of her career bergman couldn't get arrested; in 1949 she left hollywood to make a picture in europe, fell for director roberto rossellini and never looked forward. after five turkeys in italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year, after making this for renoir, she was back where she belonged and with an oscar to boot for anastasia. this is one of three movies that renoir made in color around this time and on balance it's better than the golden coach, which isn't hard, and about even with french can can. renoir probably figured that with so much going for her bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and renoir picked two doozys in jean marais and mel ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. the plot is actually based on a real incident in french history but renoir is content to give it a once-over-lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up. in its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period les grandes manouvres which is no bad thing. all in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress.
