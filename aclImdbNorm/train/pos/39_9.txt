this is apparently one of shemp's first shorts with the stooges. (this excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team). but the threesome's comedic timing is at its honed best here. aside from the intense slapstick scenes, there are others more subtle, but just as funny. watch larry when shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. or watch the real object prompting moe's exclamation, "oh...highly polished mahogany!"<br /><br />emil sitka is at his bewildered goofiest. and the goon may look scary, but he's somehow funny. he seems as frustrated and perplexed with the stooges as are "regular" people in other shorts.<br /><br />for shemp aficionados, this is a must have episode. it won't disappoint.
