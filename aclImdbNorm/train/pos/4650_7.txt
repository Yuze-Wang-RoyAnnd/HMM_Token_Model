as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9 (mbb bo 105) flight scenes in this movie. one of the few disappointments was the ews 39 jammer pod, in this case an inert rb 75 (maverick) missile painted black with the letters "ews 39" in white along the side. real jammer pods definitely do not look like that, at least not the ones i've seen.<br /><br />but apart from that, it's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending (the last minute). anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units, including the now-legendary ssg, on film should see this one.<br /><br />
