i really can say i felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by tom cruise. i didn't cared much about tom cruise's acting prowess but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie...not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead character....they merge and then speak and its beautiful. however i must say this movie doesn't come under the "average flick of weekend" which you pick at random and watch gleefully; it carries strong sentiments and characters so don't wash this one down with your beer and pop-corns. it certainly needs more than that.
