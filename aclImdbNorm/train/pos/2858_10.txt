bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. lorne greene, pernell whitaker, michael landon, dan blocker, and even guy williams (as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace adam when he was leaving the series). the cast had chemistry, and they seemed to genuinely like each other. that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have. it also made many of their best stories into great western drama.<br /><br />like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season, there are bound to be some weak ones. however, most of the time each episode had an interesting story, some kind of conflict, and a resolution that usually did not include violence. while bonanza was a western, the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction. while i am a fan of the rifleman and wanted: dead or alive; those shows usually ended with a gunfight. gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict, and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing.<br /><br />in the early years of bonanza, there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights. those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series, but they are pretty good in and of themselves. in 1964, when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show, guy williams was brought in to replace him. williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin. unfortunately, whitaker decided to stay one more year, and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend. if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza, one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965, when pernell whitaker left the show.<br /><br />undoubtedly, once pernell whitaker left the series, the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks. whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes, and his absence left a void in the cast. little joe always wanted to play the nice kid, and hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. since ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, that did not leave too much room for any gunfights.<br /><br />at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy (david canary) who became their fourth member of the cast, but candy was never featured in any gunfights, and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe. for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin (jamie, played by the forgettable mitch vogel) who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone.<br /><br />apparently by adding the teenager, the studio was looking to attract younger viewers. it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, delinquency, etc. those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter-culture movement. dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order tv, though hawaii 5-0, the f.b.i. and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief, mayhem, and crime.<br /><br />the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems, but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general. after dan blocker died, the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled. the last season was pretty bad, as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife, and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife, and how unfair it was that she was killed.<br /><br />i don't think i have ever seen the last episode of the series, and i wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way. by the last year, there was only ben (lorne greene) actually living on the ponderosa, as adam had moved away (and never came back even once as a guest) and hoss had died and little joe had left after his wife (in the series) had been killed by drifters.<br /><br />overall, the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series. once adam left, it slowly declined. most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too. by 1970, the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical, and it had lost a lot of its western flavor. the addition of candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show, and the death of hoss (dan blocker) was the final nail. bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and of the 465 episodes that were produced, at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama! that is a pretty good record. even the worst of bonanza is better than a lot of other tv shows.
