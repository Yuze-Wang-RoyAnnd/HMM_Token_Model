corbin bernsen gives a terrifically intense and riveting performance as dr. alan feinstone, a wealthy and successful beverly hills dentist who's obsessed with perfection. when he discovers that his lovely blonde babe trophy wife has been cheating on him and the irs start hounding him about tax problems, feinstone cracks under the pressure and goes violently around the bend. director brian yuzna, working from a suitably dark, witty and demented script by stuart gordon, dennis paoli, and charles finch, exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis bubbling underneath the squeaky clean well-manicured surface of respectable affluent rich america with deliciously malicious glee. moreover, yuzna further spices up the grisly goings on with a wickedly twisted sense of pitch black gallows humor. bernsen positively shines as dr. feinstone; he expertly projects a truly unnerving underlying creepiness that's right beneath feinstone's deceptively calm and assured veneer. the supporting cast are likewise excellent: linda hoffman as feinstone's bitchy, unfaithful wife brooke, earl boen as smarmy, meddlesome irs agent marvin goldblum, molly hagan as feisty assistant jessica, patty toy as perky assistant karen, jan hoag as jolly office manager candy, virginya keehne as sweet, gawky teenager sarah, ken foree as thorough, no-nonsense detective gibbs, tony noakes as gibbs' equally shrewd partner detective sunshine, michael stadvec as womanizing stud muffin pool cleaner matt, and mark ruffalo as on the make sleazeball steve landers. the first-rate make-up f/x are every bit as gory, gross and upsetting as they ought to be. the polished cinematography by levie isaaks boasts lots of great crazy tilted camera angles and a few tasty zoom-in close-ups. alan howarth's spirited shuddery score also hits the flesh-crawling spot. an enjoyably warped treat.
