i enjoyed this film. i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before - a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot. unfortunately, for michael douglas' character, "pete garrison," they think he's the mole but he isn't. <br /><br />he's just a morally-flawed agent having an affair with the first lady! since he's doing that, he's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it's revealed there is a plot to kill the president.<br /><br />"garrison" is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. douglas does a fine job in this role. i don't always care the people he plays but he's an excellent actor. keifer sutherland ("david breckinridge") is equally as good (at least in here) as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth. when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. the crooks are interesting, too, by the way. also, i have never - and never will, unfortunately - see a first lady who looks as good as kim basinger<br /><br />this is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish. are there holes in it? of course; probably a number of them, and a reason you see so many critical comments. however, it is unfairly bashed here. it just isn't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website. my advice: chill, just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. yes, it gets a little rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment.....which is what movies are all about.
