this is one of my favorite family movies. loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that i'm older. i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times. i never have much cared for animals talking, or at least un-animated ones but this one i'll stand up for. it's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart.<br /><br />there aren't any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with, let alone like as much as this one. i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i don't think show. i really holds that great message that" home is where the heart is." or at least that's the message i gained from it. definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
