when sabrina first came onto our screens i was about 12, and therefore spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch get into all kinds of weird predicaments.<br /><br />it was always one of my favourite programmes, the witchy feeling of sixties sitcom 'bewitched' but this time the character was cooler. i always liked sabrina because she was smart. she was also friendly and easy going which made her enjoyable to watch. the characters at the beginning were great; harvey, jenny, libby, the quizmaster, salem and mr. poole (my personal fave, shame he left so early on) hilda and zelda her aunts started off ok, but then became irritating.<br /><br />i liked mr. kraft too as he was always that little bit closer to discovering sabrina's secret. what i loved about the first three series was the original ideas, the discovering of the family secret and learning new spells but as it went on it became more predictable. too many characters came and left, such as valerie, dreama and brad and then they decided to do sabrina at college which ruined it for me.<br /><br />sabrina became self-absorbed at college, there was less magic, no spell book, no aunts living with her and roxie, miles and morgan were annoying.<br /><br />the last series was boring, and i only watched to see what happened in the end. not having hilda and zelda seemed wrong somehow and miles was gone just like that. the last episode made me feel a lot better though (spoiler)having sabrina end up with harvey on her wedding day to dullard aaron was great! overall a great programme if you forget the poor last two or three series which reminded me of so many teen shows. magical.
