this is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark - half man type critter on an uncharted island, then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them! lots of bad gci, goofy plot elements, and babes sweating in tight t-shirts follow.<br /><br />these monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this one spices things up with a bit of humor (i guarantee the folks who made this had tongues firmly planted in cheek), not to mention the sexy babes. but let's mention those sexy babes - several hot babes, in tight t-shirts, sweating profusely. one's in her undies at the beginning, another at the end. thank you, thank you, makers of bad movies! the plot is full of goofy stuff, a guy drives up in a jeep, slams it right into a tree, then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter. yeah, um, well, how 'bout we think about that for a while; we'll get back to you. the sharkman is hilarious - either awful cgi or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit. the mad scientist gives a pretty good performance; he's evil, that's his motivation, he makes no apologies.<br /><br />overall, if you want a stupid, fun b-movie, this one should do the job.
