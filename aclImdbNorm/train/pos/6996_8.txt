this movie was a really great flick about something that affects us all. i know i've personally run into this many times. thank goodness will smith has jumped onto the societal issue of text messaging while driving. people, don't do it. an hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause. personally, i wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie. i was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty bags of popcorn. i decided to disable all text messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same. if you care about your family, make them watch this vital public service announcement on text messaging while driving or they could kill seven people. thanks for showing us the way.
