" sa som i himmelen " .. as above so below.. that very special point where divine and human meet. i adore this film ! a gem. yes amazing grace !<br /><br />i was so deeply moved by its very human quality. i laughed and cried through a whole register , indeed several octaves of emotions.<br /><br />mikael nyqvist 'is brilliant as daniel , a first rate passionate performance, charismatic and powerful. his inner light and exceptional talent shines through in every scene, every interaction ,in every meeting. i was totally mesmerised, enchanted and caught up the story, which is our collective story, the story of life itself.<br /><br />the film was also so inclusive of many archetypes, messiah, wounded child ,magical child, artist, teacher, priest, abuser, abused, victim, bully, divine fool - all the characters so real and true to life - all awakened great fondness and compassion in me. <br /><br />it is a real treat to see such a thought provoking yet thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining film. oh ..mustn't forget the heavenly choir of angels and breathtakingly beautiful sound. <br /><br />thank you all - this swedish film will surely captivate people world-wide. brilliant !
