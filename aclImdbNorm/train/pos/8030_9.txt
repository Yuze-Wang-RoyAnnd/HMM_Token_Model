this was another great tom berenger movie.. but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome.. tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama! billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end! sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it.. i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick.. i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent!
