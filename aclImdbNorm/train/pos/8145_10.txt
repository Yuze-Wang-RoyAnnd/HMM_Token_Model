i first saw this movie about 4 years ago and i was expecting something funny, similar to cb4. i was blown away. i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great. way better than cb4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything. top notch independent film that was given "two thumbs up" by siskel and egbert (and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick, you know it's good).
