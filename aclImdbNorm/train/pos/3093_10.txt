why didn't the producers give that show a chance of all the junk on tv, why didn't the producers give six degrees a chance? will the series go on video? i would love to see how it ends. put season one on video and sell it. i was a loyal fan of six degrees and waited for it's return. i set my recorder to tape all of the shows. thank god for that. i just found out that the show was canceled and i'm heart broken. i wish i knew it was going to be canceled, why didn't they tell us? i thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters. the writing was pretty good also. steven (campbell scott) is my all time favorite. i am so sorry to see it go!
