i got to see this just this last friday at the los angeles film festival at laemlee's on beverly. this movie got the most applause of all the films that evening. considering that two music videos opened first, i didn't know what to expect since they were very fast and attention grabbing, i wasn't sure i was ready for a short immediately. but to my surprise i really enjoyed this. i thought the main actor demon guy was really good. i was so impressed with his performance that i checked out his name. i was surprised to see that this was the witchblade guy. he's gotten really good especially since then! either that or he was given lousy roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short. the girl did an okay job. i guess its hard since it was her first performance and being so young. the dad did well also. there was a lot of really nice cg work for a short, both for this and the short playing next "mexican hat" which was also nice, but i enjoyed this the most because it had the most depth and emotion and i actually cared about the characters. the other was a very simple story. the story was quite illustrative and dark! it dealt with real topics using a more fantasy like approach to keep add people like me interested. we won't even talk about the last film in the block which i left. my only complaint is that i only wish i had seen more of the demon character and a little less of getting started, which is why i gave it a 9 out of 10. i also thought the end credits went a little slowly. otherwise it was beautifully told, directed and edited. the timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast mtv editing done on everything nowadays. there will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor. i now will think of him as the sorrows lost actor not the witchblade guy.
