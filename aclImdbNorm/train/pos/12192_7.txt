this 1947 film stars and was directed and written by orson welles (with a funky irish accent) and also stars the gorgeous rita hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair. so, i've hung out with orson before in touch of evil and citizen kane and the third man etc. but this was my first rita hayworth interaction. our first meeting went well, she does a superb job playing the frightened/cagey elsa, married to a crippled millionaire lawyer. mike (welles) and elsa fall for each other. he wants to run away with her, she doesn't know if she can live without the things money can buy. elsa, her husband, and his partner bicker and bite, just like the sharks mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true. several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house. (think the ending shootout in the man with the golden gun, which borrowed heavily from this scene). i wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end.<br /><br />this movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. the dish centers on the sea, it is subtle, sour, and pungent, all to great effect. these might not be the best, fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from costco. the flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy, but filling alternative to more mundane, common fare. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
