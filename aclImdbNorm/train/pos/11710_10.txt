long before tim lahaye and jerry b. jenkins would shake the world of the christian subculture (and make millions in the process) with the left behind books, mark iv pictures, the christian film distribution company of the billy graham evangelistic association, gave us this masterwork. what i love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail, sitting in a living room. instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "post-rapture" tribulation, we sit in the living room, hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can't afford to show it. the film's premise is grounded in pre-millenial, pre-tribulation eschatalogy, believing that christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church, and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth. what used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh. the intriguing adventures of patty and her journey throughout the tribulation (and two of the film's three sequels) tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation. i hate to admit it, but i still thoroughly enjoy watching this. it even has the same exact score of monty python and the holy grail. i think i'm the only person in history to make that observation.
