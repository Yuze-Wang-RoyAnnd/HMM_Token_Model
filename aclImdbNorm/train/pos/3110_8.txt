the third and last part of the bourne trilogy (duh), is lacking a bit in the story department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better.<br /><br />the director and star (damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story-wise. how they got around that? the action scenes, for once, but they did another thing too, which i can't reveal, because that would be a spoiler. but if you watch the movie, than you'll notice it! funnily enough i read, that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films .. if that means anything to you :o)
