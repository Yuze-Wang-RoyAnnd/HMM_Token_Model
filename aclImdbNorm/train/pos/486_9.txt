'the luzhin defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time. it is a brooding, intense film, and kept my attention the entire time. john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender, eccentric chess grandmaster, and emily watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family. the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story. all in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster, and turturro and watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the film. most people will come out of the theater thinking, and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories.
