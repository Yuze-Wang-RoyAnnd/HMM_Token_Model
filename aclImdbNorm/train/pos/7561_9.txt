the version i saw of this film was the blockbuster rental with a similar title, but a swear word in it.<br /><br />this film was funny as hell. it was also true to the bone. if you have ever spent time in hollywood or the area around it, you will understand the humor. if not, you may not 'get it' at all.<br /><br />the story of two people in the business struggling to make it until they finally reach a breaking point, it is a rare gem. it states it is a drama, but it is a drama as much as deer hunter is a comedy.<br /><br />loren dean is wonderful, as always, as a supporting actor. jamie kennedy was able to hold his own well. his performance is especically impressive during the poodle scene. the only downside was carmen electra but we can't have everything.
