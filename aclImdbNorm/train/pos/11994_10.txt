as for many on here i can't help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood, i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters.<br /><br />to class this work of art as a "cartoon" could never do talespin justice, in fact it's an insult to class it as a "cartoon", talespin is an animation and nothing less, it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date, when disney "pulled" it from the air little did they realise what they did and i'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since.<br /><br />i'll take a moment to explain, from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck, disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since, they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkey's for the story's, i couldn't have my children watching the mind-numbing "cartoons" they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50% of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it, i couldn't let that happen, which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80's to the mid 90's on a harddrive so one day my children couldn't be corrupted by the "cartoon crap" of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespin.<br /><br />talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it's depth, charm, wit, compassion, emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today, do you see any of that content in say "ed, edd and eddie or anything else you can think of?, the rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year old's undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picasso.<br /><br />the next time you watch an episode of talespin; take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation, even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again, the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted, even the vehicles are true to life, ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and you'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail.<br /><br />the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the "deliberate mistakes" or "intended mistakes" in each episode and some have two, for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say's "you're up to something baloo" and baloo replies "who, me!, i'm as innocent as a schoolboy" take a look into rebecca's eyes, i won't spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next time.<br /><br />everyone elses comment's are bang on and 100% correct, i have nothing else to add that others haven't said already on here, disney, wake up and smell the coffee, you have been asleep for over a decade, stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing "cartoons", we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible.
