sarafina was a fun movie, and some of the songs were really great. sarafina was very entertaining. i don't normally like music things like this, but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box. the movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the soweto rioting of 1976. it showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience, and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government, who you can not sympathise with. the singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent. the clothing of the students in sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from soweto. they made the movie actually in soweto, which is why it looks very accurate in many parts. all these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied. as viewers we must be critical of the way the history of apartheid was presented. as i said before, you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective. also, it changes some of the details from other accounts. in sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students. the police and army were very aggressive at soweto, but this is probably an exaggerated event. the police and army did shoot students, but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this. the fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. this is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students. the movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied. the teacher was arrested for being against the government, and the mum goes to work in a white persons house. but there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws. -by george s, chris and finlay
