this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics. of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, spiderman improves in both departments. it also features the voice of stan lee, the creator of spiderman comics.<br /><br />as you'd expect spiderman does whatever a spider can. he does more than spin webs. in fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. when he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. spidey has his hands full as he battles venom, rhino, mysterio, scorpion, and dr. octopus to name a few. look for captain america in a cameo.<br /><br />most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. the only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours. if you're a real marvel superhero fan, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. better luck in "spiderman 2." my evaluation: 9 out of 10.
