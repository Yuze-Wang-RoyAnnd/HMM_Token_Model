it was a doubly interesting experience. for some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century had never been the central figure in a movie*. the closest i can think of as films with einstein in them are champaign for caesar, where (like a "deus ex ma-china") the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show, so that ronald colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all, and in bullshot where the great albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain, intent on stealing some machines of theirs. it is notable that in those two cases, and in iq, we are dealing with comedies. so far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of einstein, like john huston's attempt to do one on freud with montgomery cliff. i guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro-magnetic field theory into exciting dialog. but then, only three years ago russell crowe and christopher plummer did a beautiful mind. maybe nobody really has tried.<br /><br />(*subsequently, after writing this, i remembered the successful comedy young einstein with yahoo serious about ten years ago. but that is an exception and it was a spoof.)<br /><br />the other surprise was the actor playing the great albert. it was walter matthau, here taking time away from the series of films he did with jack lemmon in that last decade of their careers. matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor, in both comedy and drama, but normally his comic personas were variants of his "whiplash willie" gingrich from the fortune cookie. they were connivers and gonifs. later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them, but they remained grumpy types. but his albert einstein happens to be genuinely sweet. more like his kotch than like willie clarke.<br /><br />he plays albert as good old uncle albert. it seems that matthau's einstein is living in princeton with his niece catherine boyd (meg ryan), and she is seeing a stuffy professor named james morland (stephen fry). but fry's car needs repairs, and they take it to the auto shop where ed walters (tim robbins) works. robbins falls for ryan, who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires. good old uncle albert, aided by his three friends (lou jacobi, joseph maher, and gene saks) decide to give their assistance to robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius. this will open the doors of romance between him and ryan, provided ryan is impressed and fry does not spoil things (as he hopes to do).<br /><br />the atmosphere is sweet, as when matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help robbins cheat on (by switching the positions of their bodies). the plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship - which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of president eisenhower (keene curtis).<br /><br />it was a charming comedy, and an interesting stretch for matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal, but far more subdued.
