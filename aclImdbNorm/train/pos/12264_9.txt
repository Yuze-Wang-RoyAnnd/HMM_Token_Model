if you as i have a very close and long relationship with the world of tintin....do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about herg'e and his life creating tintin. i'ts so brilliant and a very cool production. the whole background story about herg'e and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is amazing. there is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this. i will for sure be in my basement digging up the tintin albums again. also, the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it. i really do hope people will find this as intriguing as i did!
