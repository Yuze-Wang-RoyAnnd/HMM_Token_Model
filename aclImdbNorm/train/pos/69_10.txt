i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start - every time i even thought going to bed, something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime.<br /><br />this movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti-gun film, but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings. and even better, the movie kept on with the real life - just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out, a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie. this film not only doesn't follow the formula, it shows how other events often lead up to and/or affect what happens afterwards.<br /><br />i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti-depressant drugs more - the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started. up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have. it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film, having a relative who suffers from a mental illness, i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses. bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues. and for those who think certain things couldn't happen in a hospital (i don't want to tell any particulars), you're dead wrong on that too - i've been there. the script was so real it was amazing.<br /><br />go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late. someday they'll thank you for it.
