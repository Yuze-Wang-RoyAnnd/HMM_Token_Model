this very strange movie is unlike anything made in the west at the time. with its tumultuous emotions and net of visions, dreams, and startling images, its effect is both beautiful and unsettling. the actors are choreographed more like dance than acting. it contains the only dream sequence i know of that actually resembles a real nightmare (sorry, dali fans).
