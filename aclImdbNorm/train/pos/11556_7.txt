jack lemmon and walter matthau began and ending their career together. remember best as the grumpiest of old men as well as the oddest couple to have ever made us laugh, lemmon and matthau were one of hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years. not as "raunchy" as pryor and wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern marx brothers routine. such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that marx, chaplin and keaton were so famous for. in the odd couple, lemmon and matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos. the physical comedy is as unique as chaplins. the joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another. not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime. the chemistry between lemmon and matthau is entertainment enough. although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy.
