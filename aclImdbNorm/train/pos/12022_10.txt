as a huge fan of the original, i avoided this film like the plague when the bad reviews started coming in eight years ago, but i just finished watching this film and found it to be a really pleasant surprise.<br /><br />okay, if you are looking for a retread of the original, you're in for a big disappointment, but if you are looking for something quite different, a bit edgy and political, then this is the film for you. <br /><br />gregory is now thirty four and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school, where he's being pursued by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams about one of his students. when the student insists on meeting up with gregory, a series of misadventures ensue that include torture, breaking and entering and all manner of unexpected twists and turns that left me feeling elated and moved.<br /><br />if you are looking for something original, then i highly recommend this film. i only wish that more people had gone to see this when it was released and seen it for what it really is.
