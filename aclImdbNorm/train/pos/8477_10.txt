in a not so conventional sense of the word.<br /><br />this movie was one of my favorites as a young child, and i just recently remembered it, and thought to look it up. while many of the details are no longer clear in my mind, the overall feeling that the movie gave me has stuck with me over the years.<br /><br />if parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes, then i highly recommend this movie. it taught me a lot about life and death, and brought forth in me a lot of emotion. to this day, it remains one of my favorite films.
