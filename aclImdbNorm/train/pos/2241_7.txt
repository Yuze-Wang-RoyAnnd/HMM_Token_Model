another comedy about a plucky little country struggling through the jungle of the modern (for the forties) global world with only native wit and pluck to guide them, this is a fine entry in the ealing cannon. terry-thomas sparkles as usual in the lead, as a feckless ministry man led to the brink of disaster when a nation he is supposedly in charge of starts attracting the interest of the world, ian bannen makes a great romantic lead, peter sellers puts in one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politico and the uber-suave john le mesurier plays against type as a rugged revolutionary leader. lots of fun is had by all, especially the viewer; perhaps not in the very top echelon of ealing classics, but pretty high up.
