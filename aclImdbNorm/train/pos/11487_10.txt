as always, controversial movies like this have mixed reviews. you either love it or you hate it, and not everyone will like this movie. this shows the perspective of the killers, which is something i personally feel is something important to consider. you may hate them, you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate, but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective.<br /><br />the movie is shot entirely using a hand-held camera, something that i think works quite well as it makes it more realistic. it is told completely from the killers point of view, from their "missions" to family outings, all leading up the big day "zero day" in which they are planning on a massacre at their school. zero day does not offer answers, but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves. our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred, but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing. they are shown to be surprisingly normal, typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives, and if we didn't know what they were planning we wouldn't expect a thing (they make it clear throughout the whole movie that no-one else knows about their plan)<br /><br />the acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete unknowns. we can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future. despite how this is a fictionalized movie, one cannot help but notice the obvious similarities to columbine. calvin and andre are scarily similar to eric harris and dylan klebold, (not so much in looks, but in manner) as someone who has researched columbine very extensively, i could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it. <br /><br />the actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things i have ever seen. i was completely in shock after seeing it, and its a feeling that stays around for a while. it is very realistic and well-done, and it is very difficult to watch.<br /><br />all in all zero day is an excellent movie, and i think everyone should at least check it out. in the past, we have always simply branded killers "psychopaths" and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence, but as zero day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that, and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers.
