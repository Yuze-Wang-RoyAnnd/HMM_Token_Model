the plot is real horrific, the atmosphere really depressive, unusual for a low-budget production like that, and at least, for a german production. a little bit of indian spirituality, mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together. the development of plot and characters are great, the sets very close to reality, without any studio-atmosphere. it could be perfect, but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing, what don't inevitably have to be typically for low-budget movies:<br /><br />1.) the cast sometimes is not more than average. almost every actor look like a layman. some of them do a good, or a very good job, but some are acting like the actors of crappy german court-shows! but i was very, very disappointed of the acting of mathieu carri`ere! his acting ( in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine ) here was below-average! but that could be the reason, why he today takes part in crappy german soaps or tv-series on private channels.<br /><br />2.) the dialogs are sometimes on soap-opera-level. <br /><br />3.) the bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand, what the characters are saying. i saw it on dvd and was glad to could rewind and to listen it again. it caused by the set ( big halls as in the hospital or with the esoterically group ) and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors!<br /><br />but all in all, it is an interesting movie, worth to watch it, far beyond the commercially movies, which are often more terrible.
