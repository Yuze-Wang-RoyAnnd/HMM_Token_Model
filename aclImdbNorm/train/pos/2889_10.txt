***might not consider this having a spoiler, but i'd rather be cautious than careless*** i never saw this movie when i was little. i fell in love with it the first time i saw it with my three year old daughter. i can watch it over and over again.<br /><br />for the little acting ilene woods did in her lifetime, she was a wonderful voice for cinderella; very appealing; very believable. the music really fit the movie perfectly. the acting was great; loved the mice!! you really "hated" lady tremain and the step-sisters; they were just awful. the cartoonists depicted the spoiled behavior very well.<br /><br />this is a wonderful movie, especially if you are into love stories. my daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and still gets excited at the end.
