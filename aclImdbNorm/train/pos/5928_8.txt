this is not a good movie but i still like it. the cat clovis is gold in a jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to the evil sleepwalkers. i think there is more to this movie than people realize, basically it is very harsh, but this brusqueness can sometimes be good. it's got the corny lines, the abrupt ending and a comedic element conveyed by the bumbling policemen.<br /><br /> did anyone find the incestuous element a bit disturbing? ultimately this movie is casually and randomly acrimonious, which is quite effective, i liken it to psycho - the relationship between the mother and son, the changing of protagonists. i think the abruptness works also, this is not a movie that you want them to lengthen, it only works if it's short.<br /><br />i'm still not sure whether the director lacked depth, or whether he did these things with purpose, we know stephen king has ability, yet i haven't even read his books, only seen some of his movies.<br /><br />anyway, i liked it. if you like harsh corny movies with 80's overtones just watch it. but don't expect too much. it really is so bad its good.
