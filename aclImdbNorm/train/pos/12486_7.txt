well, this film is a difficult one really. to be straight with you, this film doesn't contain much of a riveting story, nore does it make u 'want' to know how it'll end...but i'll tell you something now...never have i been as tense and jumped up before in my life! this film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills! to be fair, i did watch it at almost midnight so i was kinda sleepy anyway, so maybe that explains why i was jumpy...or maybe it's because this film does deliver in that aspect! it's basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. they decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains...all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (i think it's it's the sister of the main character, and she brings along her husband)...during the night, the husband hears noises...checks it out, and thats when things start to go really really wrong...they don't stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isn't right...to cut a long story short...eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of.<br /><br />it's not a hollywood blockbuster, nore does it have a huge budget, but please don't let that put you off. it's creepy, tense and very very jumpy! just give it a try :)
