this two-parter was excellent - the best since the series returned. sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films, but what tv shows don't do that these days. what we got here was a cracking good sci-fi story. a great big (really scary) monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit, some superb aliens in the ood - the best "new" aliens the revived series has come up with, a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters (complete with a couple of unnamed "expendable" security people in true star trek fashion), some large-scale philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.), and some top-drawer special effects.<br /><br />i loved every minute of this.
