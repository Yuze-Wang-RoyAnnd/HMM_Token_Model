i really loved this film, yes, i know it was fairly far fetched, there is no way that shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all it's traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together. cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the brit bad guy, he was a little "too" much don't you think? anyway, great film, great cars and great acting. i for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night. :)
