this movie is awesome on so many levels... and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on.<br /><br />just remember this: when you're watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies... be they good or bad... this is the formula that they are using. this is what makes zombie movies so great.<br /><br />and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie. a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know.<br /><br />all in all, it doesn't linger. there's never a point where you think to yourself "c'mon, get on with it"... it moves quick and corners nicely. this is the sporty, little italian number of zombie flicks.<br /><br />so awful, it's wonderful! if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek... rent it, buy it, love it.<br /><br />as a great trivia note: if you're watching it on dvd, you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen, underneath the musical score... well... that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop.
