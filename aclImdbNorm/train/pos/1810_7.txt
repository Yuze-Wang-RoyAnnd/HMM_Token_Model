i can understand why some people like this movie, and why some people don't. for me, though, i really like it, even if i noticed some good bits, and not so impressive bits. the animation was actually excellent, like charlie's dream. the characters were a mixed bag, the best being anne-marie, voiced by the late judith barsi.(i was physically ill when i read what happened to her) also, carface is a very convincing villain,especially voiced by the wonderful vic tayback(i particularly loved "morons i'm surrounded by morons") and along with rasputin and warren t.rat is probably the most memorable of all the don bluth villains. charlie and itchy only just lacked the same sparkle, but i loved king gator and his song. some of the film is very haunting, like annabelle's "you can never come come back", which kind of scares me still. unfortunately, there were some bits i didn't like so much. the story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but disney's black cauldron suffered from the same problem. also there were some dark scenes, that young children would find upsetting, but the ending is very poignant. however the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung. none of them in particular stick out, with exception of "let's make music together" and "love survives", and burt reynolds can't sing and dom deluise has done much better singing. all in all, a watchable movie, that could have been more, but is definitely memorable, and i would definitely watch it again. 7/10. bethany cox
