i saw this movie at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year. this movie presents page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and b&d stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress. page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the 50's pinup icon. this film is supposedly based on the book "the real bettie page" by richard foster. it's shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feel. i have the book called "bettie page the life of a pinup legend" that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of page and i must say that this movie reproduces on film, with gretchen mol as page, many of those famous photo's very accurately. mol herself with the bettie page black wig and brown contact lenses is bettie page. not only does she have the bettie page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect. and her body is as close to a replica of page's as possible. terrific casting. the story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better. but this is a pretty good tv movie. i would rate it a 7.0 of a scale of 10 and recommend it's viewing when it comes on tv.
