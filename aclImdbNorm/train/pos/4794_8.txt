it takes patience to get through david lynch's eccentric, but-- for a change-- life-affirming chronicle of alvin straight's journey, but stick with it. though it moves as slow as straight's john deere, when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging, the painful regrets and secrets, and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation. richard farnsworth caps his career with the year's most genuine performance, sad and poetic, flinty and caring. and sissy spacek matches him as his "slow" daughter rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad. rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family.
