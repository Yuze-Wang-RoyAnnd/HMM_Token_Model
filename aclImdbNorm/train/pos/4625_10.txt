shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film i've seen all year. it's about a prison program, somewhere in california if i recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. the film follows their production of "the tempest" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it breathtaking to watch -- literally; i gasped out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted felon's crime. it's like some loopy episode of oz, and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
