this is a great movie. i love it more each time i watch. most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as ben stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or hank azaria says good-bye to louise lasser, or geoffrey rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or tom waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or janeane garofalo refuses a kiss from paul reubens -- is a pleasure. this is pitch perfect ensemble acting. the story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups payoff by the end. seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't then get started. you can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (wes studi, william h. macy, the tryouts scene. too much good stuff!)
