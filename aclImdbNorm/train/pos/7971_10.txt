this is a great movie for all ages. its the story about three animals how have to find their way home. there is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie. you never know what is going to happen next. this movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. you just don't know what going to happen next. the trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes. they producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too. the animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors/actress themselves. everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 the whole way! rent or buy it today i can guarantee you will love it the whole family will!
