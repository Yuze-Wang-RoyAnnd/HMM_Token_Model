i didn't expect much when i first saw the dvd cover. i mean, pierce brosnan as grey owl??<br /><br />ah...but then the story got underway, unfolded in a beautifully photographed and paced film. i was surprised and delighted at this (basically) true story. made me want to read more about this fascinating character, which means, the director fulfilled his purpose, and the film was a success!
