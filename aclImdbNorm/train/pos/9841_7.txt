i love cartoons. they can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. they can push the boundaries of satire ('the simpsons'), good taste ('south park'), spectacle ('aladdin'), or reality ('toy story'). there are some good examples of this in 'ice age', such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside, chatting like old friends. such scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. while ice age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time, it's a really fun film. sit back, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs.<br /><br />the story follows manfred the grumpy mammoth, sid, an idiotic sloth, and diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. on the way, naturally, they have a whole lot of problems. also popping up throughout the journey is scrat, history's unluckiest rodent, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on top of dead trees, in ice-caves. his opening scene is a classic.<br /><br />it's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in, but some of the scenes, such as the nappy-changing or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are likeable and it looks good. there is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of manfred's eyes.<br /><br />not a must-see, but good for a fun hour or so.<br /><br />7/10
