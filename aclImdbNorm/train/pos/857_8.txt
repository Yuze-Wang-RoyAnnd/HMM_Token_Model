greetings again from the darkness. much anticipated, twisted comedy from writer/director richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor. that bond guy is gone. this new guy is something else entirely!! have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role, but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble, "facilitator" ... and is anything but pretty! do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one. if you go, expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex, killing, religion, sports, business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect. brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements. even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to behold.<br /><br />greg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnan's comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click. hope davis has a small, but subtly effective supporting role as kinnear's wife (what's with her name "bean"?) who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room.<br /><br />the visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, racetrack and denver suburb. and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack? this one is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky film-making, it could be for you.
