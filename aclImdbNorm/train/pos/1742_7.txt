perhaps, one of the most important and enjoyable greek films i've seen in the last ten years..excellent performances(especially yiannis zouganelis is great), well-written script and effective direction from a very special, for the greek very average standards, auteur. a film, obviously influenced by sam peckinpah's straw dogs, that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end. nevertheless, this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of greek movies which should be watched outside greece. it's a shame that in greece didn't work commercially, in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like politiki kouzina..
