while this movie won't go down in the annals of great cinema, it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. the film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place.<br /><br />the film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named, "the hungry bachelors club". jorja fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open. bill nunn plays a cadillac-loving mystery man who becomes her lover. fox gives an understated and touching performance and nunn is reliably talented as always. micheal des barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney. the ensemble casts - made up of familiar faces - works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life. this is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family.
