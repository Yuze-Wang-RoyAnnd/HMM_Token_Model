four prisoners share a single cell: the domineering transvestite, marcus (clovis cornillac); marcus's idiot savant buddy, paquerette (dimitri rataud), who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches, cockroaches, and his little sister; lassalle (philippe laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and carr`ere (g'erald laroche), the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping. after a brick falls from the wall of the cell, the men discover the hidden journal written by a 'fountain of youth'-obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s. is this journal the secret to their escape? or is there something much more sinister behind it?<br /><br />i was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience i have with eric valette was the dreadful one missed call (2008), which i consider to be the worst theatrically released film i've ever seen. however, much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to klavan's awful script, because (as i remember) valette's direction wasn't the worst part about the film (unless he chose to include the baby). anyway, mal'efique was a good way to get my respect back. . . it's a french film (obviously something i like) and it takes place in prison (which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums). so that's two points for him before the film even starts. luckily, valette had me once the film ended as well. mal'efique is a rather deep, rather complex, rather compelling story of obsession and desperation. . . the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality. while it's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense, the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening. the period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film i've seen in quite some time and i would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore.<br /><br />final verdict: 8.5/10. quite a bit of respect earned back by valette.<br /><br />note: paramount picked up the rights to make an american remake (surprise surprise). it's due out in 2009. i'm not sure why, to be honest, as this doesn't seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states. but, i've been surprised before.<br /><br />vive la france! <br /><br />-ap3-
