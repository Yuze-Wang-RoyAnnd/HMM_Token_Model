not many movies were made about the lighter-than-air (lta) aspect of aviation, but this is one of them and it's damn good. just a fun film to watch.<br /><br />most of the movie takes place at the navy blimp operations at nas lakehurst (with nas tustin playing the role). wallace beery plays a likable but munchausen-like senior chief ned trumpet, an enlisted pilot, whose tall tales have gotten so frequent nobody really believes him. half the fun is near the end of the movie when events start proving that most of his more outlandish tales are actually true.<br /><br />set during wwii, the main plot centers around bachelor trumpet wooing a local widow only to end up having a father-son relationship with the widow's crippled son, jess. told he would never walk without crutches by doctors, chief trumpet pulls some strings and a navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the lad's crippled leg. jess goes on to join the navy to become a flight officer, flying blimps back at lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges.<br /><br />a very well-done movie, albeit not without some corny hollywood dialogue slipping past the technical advisers, and beery's apparent inability to march in step. otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy, and gives a rare look into the navy's lta operations. the cash register scene, an exchange between trumpet and jess's future love interest cathy, is an absolute hoot.
