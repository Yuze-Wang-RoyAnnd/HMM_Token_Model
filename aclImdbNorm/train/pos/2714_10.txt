this was one of those wonderful rare moments in t.v. that i wished i'd captured forever on vhs. won't it ever air again? <br /><br />it was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating. i want to see it all again. i want to buy it. i want what i can't have. not even on ebay. <br /><br />so, having ranted enough it was, by far, one of the best series the 80's put out. it should be considered a classic but is lost in space. at least this website and wikipedia mention it. sob.<br /><br />it was utterly appealing, funny, flirtatious, and original. maybe not like sherlock holmes original, i actually think quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky holmes ever could.
