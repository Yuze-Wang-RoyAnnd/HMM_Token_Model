i really enjoyed this movie. the humor was a bit absent at times but i enjoyed how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film. this is the only the second movie where i saw verdone acting (the other was 'un sacco bello'), and i can see why italians find him tiresome, but he think he played his role well as the loving father.<br /><br />my one drawback with this movie was that i knew it took place in italy - somewhere in the center or south, i presume, but i felt like there was no representation of a place. this movie could have taken place in new york, boston, melbourne, new dehli...i always think it is important for movies to have a place to give the viewers something to relate to. (maybe i missed something?) :) if you like italian films, then i think that you will enjoy this. it's not a fellini or a rossellini - it's not realism or neo-realism. it's a comical story with serious moments that could really happen to any of us.
