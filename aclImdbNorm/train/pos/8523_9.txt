i was a fan of the book ever since third grade, so of course i had watched the movie, read the sequel, and then watched the television show. it was a good show in itself, and now as an adult i still enjoy the show. my only real problem with it was that it didn't follow the book. the first time i saw it, i was so disappointed that i turned it off. but that's coming from a girl who owns a first addition of the book. but after time i decided to give it a try again and ignored the book (kind of like what you have to do with the harry potter movies). i found the series wonderful! it was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy, just the right amount comedy to keep everyone going. it is truly enjoyable! clean and wonderful!
