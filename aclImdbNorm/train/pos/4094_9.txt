for anyone who has only seen disney productions beautifully animated version of 'beauty & the beast', or even jean cocteau's surreal fairy tale vision will be quite taken aback by this 1975 french (but with a director from poland) version. the plot concerns a french family of fading aristocracy that is marrying into a well to do english family. the major catch is that the bridegroom is carrying an ancient curse on the family. the film also includes many flashback sequences (potentially) explaining this family curse. from the opening credits, to the very end, it's a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride, with some very explicit & graphic sexual content (hence the film's x rating in the u.s. in it's initial run,which is now unrated). the film's somewhat contemptuous sentiment at the ruling class will probably remind one of bunuel's flights into similar territory. if you have a taste for the truly bizarre, and are not offended by "taboo" material, then this film may just scratch that itch for you.
