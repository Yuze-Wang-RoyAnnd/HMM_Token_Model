michelle rodrigez was made for this movie, when i first saw her in fast and the furious. you could tell that she was a tough woman. with this movie, she has not only proven her acting, but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie. she is more a bad girl and that's what i like about her. this movie is about a troubled girl, living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family. as she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer, she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her. even though they don't think she has the potential, they get to be shown proven wrong.<br /><br /> i think this movie was a little slow at the ending, but was well done. it shows, that people can do anything even if they don't think you have the potential. i recommend it to be seen.
