would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one? i never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement. margaret sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and james stewart always brought out the best in each other. this movie sports what i think is frank morgan's most winning performance, and with "the wizard of oz" and "tortilla flat" under his belt, that is saying a lot. the way he finds a christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy. director ernst lubitsch might have thought "trouble in paradise" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph. with some of the wittiest dialogue american movies of the 30's has to offer.
