i have to admit to enjoying bad movies. i love them i watch all of them. horror especially. my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy tapes, order a pizza and have a blast. this one had a great box, so i was expecting less than usual.<br /><br />the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed, and the other underground layers are simply covered up. the inhabitants of this neighborrhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave. this wakes up some zombies.<br /><br />from this point on, it's chunk-city. the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll.<br /><br />ok, it's not great art, but this one, with its in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening. actually, it was one of the best "party tapes" i have ever had the pleasure of watching. and you could tell it was done on no money, with a bunch of crazy people. there are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like brendan frazer (he has a cameo) and it is just a wild trip.
