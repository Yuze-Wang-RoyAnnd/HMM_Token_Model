how can anyone not love this movie ? i think it's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies; if you've never seen them, watch this instead. michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes. one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless d.a., but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo. he has all the best lines. danny devito, alan hale, ray walston are in this star-studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than "mafia" did for the criminal underground.
