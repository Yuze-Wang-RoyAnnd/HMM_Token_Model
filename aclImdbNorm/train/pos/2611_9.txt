this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here ... and for my money, anywhere. it's raw, gritty, the characters are real, the situations are believable and it doesn't shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and the criminals, victims, lawyers and other people in their various orbits.<br /><br />this show ran for 2 seasons and was discontinued because the show didn't sell well overseas. we are all sorry for its loss: however, like fawlty towers, we will be able to revere this as a limited-length series of uniformly high quality.
