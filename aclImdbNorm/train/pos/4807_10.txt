i really thought that this movie was superb. not only is the history correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. i was a fan of emily blunt's portrayal of victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth. blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. the romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of albert.<br /><br />the technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well. i appreciated the beautiful score, which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story. i also considered the cinematography to be outstanding, some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict.<br /><br />there have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 2009's best!
