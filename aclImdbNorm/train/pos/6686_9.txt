this movie was a brilliant concept. it was original, cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who aren't really 'conformist' movie pickers. don't get me wrong - there are some great movies that have wide appeal, but when you move into watching a movie based on "everyone else is watching it" - you know you're either a tween or don't really have an opinion. this had a lovely subtle humor - despite most people probably looking only at the obvious. the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more "personal" personality in this film. has appeal for kids, as well as adults. esp. nice to find a good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos! a great film, not to be overlooked based on public consumption. this one is a must buy.
