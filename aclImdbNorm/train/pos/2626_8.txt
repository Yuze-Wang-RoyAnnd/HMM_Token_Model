"lion king 1 1/2" is the funniest non-theatrical release from disney. i recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years. i remember first time i saw it i didn't had any expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this watchable and highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />is it better than "simba's pride"? in many ways, yes. though "simba's pride" wasn't exactly bad, it did suffer some problems: lack of an good script and bad characterizations, which made impact of what otherwise a okay film.<br /><br />anyway: it's nice to see timon and pumbaa's personalities blossom again in the way that we (or certainly me) loved about them in this film; in "simba's pride" they were completely annoying and i didn't liked the "timon and pumbaa" series neither.<br /><br />this film could easily have been a stupid one, but fortunately the filmmakers didn't took the wrong turn and instead focused to make this film at times extremely hilarious. there are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own. the score is quite good. there are two new songs, which are catchy and two new characters, timon's mom, (voiced by recognizable marge simpsons' julie kavner) and uncle max, which are enjoyable. the friendship between timon and pumbaa are touchingly portrayed. the emotional scenes are well integrated in the comical story and doesn't feel out of place, which it could have easily done (especially in comedies).<br /><br />but is there something that distracts this picture from getting 10 votes from me? yes, there is. although they fortunately doesn't impact too much, but i'll mention them: 1. many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one. personally, it was weird to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones.<br /><br />2. during the climax, some of the jokes becomes lame.<br /><br />3. storywise, this is timon's story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his tale with simba's, it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at times.<br /><br />but hey, those details doesn't impact this otherwise amusing movie. it is the only really acceptable disney sequel, which should be in every movie collection.
