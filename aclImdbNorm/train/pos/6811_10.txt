although i generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time; this film is an exception. i didn't actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake, so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison.<br /><br />the story and the way it is written is no question: it is capote. there is no need for more words.<br /><br />the play of anthony edwards and eric roberts is superb. i have seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. i was certain that they are good actors and in case of eric i always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother. this time this certainty is raised to fact, no question. his play, just as well as the play of mr. edwards is clearly the top of all their profession.<br /><br />i recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your dvd shelves.
