i enjoyed watching brigham young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the lds faith. i think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial, since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early mormon church. it is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people.<br /><br />as a member of the church, the single most disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of brigham young as one that had "knowingly deceived" church members into believing he had been called to be joseph's successor as the prophet. although i understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality, both brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church. brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather he led them confidently by inspiration. the point is important for mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith: that god truly speaks to prophets today, and that brigham young, like joseph smith, was an inspired prophet of god.<br /><br />whether or not you believe this statement or not, just know that the film does not accurately portray what brigham himself believed.
