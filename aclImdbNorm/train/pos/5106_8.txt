i guess every time i see one of these old movies from the 80's it puts me back at a simpler time, no matter how corny they may seem today. this movie is a good one. i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever. it has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be. now as an adult, i can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time i actually know what's going on. i did find one thing weird. how many people can move to houston and hook up with sissy,get married,move into a trailer,have a falling out,cheat, have an uncle die,then get back together, all in the course of a month? only in america.
