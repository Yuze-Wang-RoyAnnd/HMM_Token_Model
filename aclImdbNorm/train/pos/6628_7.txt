i've seen this film in avant-premiere at imagina festival in monaco.<br /><br />i saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, i was waiting to see the final result. i haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />it is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render. clearly inspired by some comic books, such as the ones from f. miller. in this optic, it goes one step further than the excellent "sin city" adaptation from r. rodriguez. this time, (almost) no grey or any middle color, but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film.(can't wait for scanner darkly)<br /><br />the massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements, such as direction or plot. the direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that is a really good surprise.<br /><br />the futuristic story (paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end. despite a classic base plot (an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations)the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain firms...)gives this movie a great interest.<br /><br />despite it is an animated film, this one is obviously not made for children. you won't find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral, only the cold reality. it is far closer to a good film noir.<br /><br />i found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film: we still feel the well known paris, but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism.<br /><br />nevertheless, i regret a few mistakes. the montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very clich'e slow motion effects and some poor dialogs. even though the technical is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like "final fantasy" did). those little things makes it a 7/10.<br /><br />altogether, it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can. the director, christian volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (luckyly, they didn't ask john woo to do the job!).<br /><br />to conclude, it is a film with blasting visuals, an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction. watch it if you can!<br /><br />please excuse me for the spelling mistakes.
