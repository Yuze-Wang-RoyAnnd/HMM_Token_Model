there are so many "hollywood" movies made now that are not only torture to watch, but also have no bearing on anyone's life, whatsoever. granted, movies don't always have to have deep meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still film-makers out there who care about telling "human" stories. i won't give away the premise of this brilliant film, however, the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable ones i have ever seen in my life, and i'm a 32-year-old film buff too! bug ranks top ten on my list of favorites, which includes: on the waterfront, sunset boulevard, and black narcissus, to name just a few. this "moving" movie should become one of your favorites also- that is, if you have a heart!
