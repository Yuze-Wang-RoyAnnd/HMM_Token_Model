i love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! it is that damn good! i am not much of a fan of movies but i gotta tell you this one opened my eyes. astounding color and fast energy. i was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the zoinks! film festival in boston, and the story really enveloped me from the start. it had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended i wanted more. i hope they make a sequel. that would be fun. my only problem with it is the performance of melissa connor as anya. ugh! she sucks! i've seen a block of wood pull out a better performance. i don't what the director was thinking when he cast her. but if you ignore her you can't help but give this movie a big ten!!!
