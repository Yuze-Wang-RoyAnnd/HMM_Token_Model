"protocol" is a hit-and-miss picture starring goldie hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting arab from an assassination attempt. the woman immediately becomes a celebrity, and gets a new job working for the u.s. government. will the corridors of power in our nation's capital ever be the same? hawn is excellent as usual even though "protocol" isn't as funny as her best film "private benjamin". but it's still a good movie, and i did laugh alot.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
