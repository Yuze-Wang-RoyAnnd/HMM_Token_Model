the best martial arts movie ever made. this one movie is better than anything bruce lee ever did. a classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax. jackie chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu.it's a great pity that whilst bruce lee had been so overrated, it took jackie chan an eternity to become popular in europe and america. jackie rules!!!!
