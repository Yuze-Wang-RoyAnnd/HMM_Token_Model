this was a movie that i had heard about all my life growing up, but had never seen it until a few years ago. it's reputation truly proceeded it. i knew of michael myers, had seen the mask, saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed. but i was growing up during the decade where jason and freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game, and never thought much of the halloween franchise. boy, how i was being cheated with cheap knock offs.<br /><br />halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie. now, by today's standards, it isn't as graphic and visceral, but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today. the atmosphere that john carpenter creates is so creepy, and the fact that it is set in a quaint, mid-west town is a testament to his ability. the lighting effects are down right horrifying, with "the shape" seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will. the simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense.<br /><br />the performances by all the players are well done, with specific nods to jamie lee curtis and donald pleasance. ms. curtis is such a good laurie strode because she is so likable and vulnerable. it is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by michael myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her, we want her to survive and get away.<br /><br />donald pleasance plays dr. loomis like a man on a mission, and it works well. he adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets.<br /><br />overall, not only is halloween a great horror movie, but also a great film. it works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up. this should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie. and for an even more frightful time, try watching it alone with the lights off. don't be surprised if you think you see "the shape" lurking around in the shadows!
