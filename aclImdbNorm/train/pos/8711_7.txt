it's beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from norway has been remastered for dvd release, and still gems like this don't get a shot at recapturing their past glory. i give this a 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few scifi films made for norwegian television. this film is nothing less than a film-historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first alien film. and, my word, blindpassasjer was first! did ridley scott or anyone in the crew see the mini-series? however unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. okay, the budget is _much_ lower in the norwegian film, but given that, it's a really well-done piece of work from the desolate age of norwegian movie-making, which incidentally lasted until the 90s.
