when you add up all the aspects from the movie---the dancing, singing, acting---the only one who stands out as the best in the cast is vanessa williams...her dedication, energy and timeless beauty make rosie the perfect role for her. never have i ever seen someone portray rose with such vibrancy! vanessa's singing talent shows beautifully with all the songs she performs as rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! her dancing is so incredible, even if as some people say the choreography was bad---her dancing skills were displayed better than ever before! i'd recommend this version over the '63 just because i find that although lengthy the acting by vanessa is superb-----not to mention the fact that jason alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive as well (with the exception of chynna philips...what in hell were they thinking when they cast her?)<br /><br />all in all i'd say this version is wonderful and i recommend that everyone see this version!
