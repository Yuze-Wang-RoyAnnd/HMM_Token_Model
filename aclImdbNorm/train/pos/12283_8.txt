the photography of this bid-budget production is surprisingly bad. colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has very 80ish look to it. direction and editing are often quite uninspired and tv-movie like, too. *and* at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence. hans zimmer's score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated, untalented composer.<br /><br />but if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story, a sort of european version of edna ferber's family epos giant. while at first you wonder why clara married this idiotic man, even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by. clara delivers the movie's spiritual lesson, a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country. her daughter, whose lover is a young antonio banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it. the way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great. the actors all do a great job, too. i was wondering "who is the actress playing blanca?" all the time, but of course, it was a really young winona ryder!<br /><br />all in all, this movie really made me want to read the book.
