i just saw a press screening of this film and i was pleasantly surprised. not often is it that i get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one time.<br /><br />i really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see rachael bilson and hayden back together. i think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera. my favorite scene was by far (surprisingly so) bret ratner's piece... without giving too much away, i'll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging...<br /><br />the old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together. <br /><br />both the chris cooper and the ethan hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that i've had in the big apple. over all the film is a great place to take a date... especially if you're already fond of the city itself.<br /><br />i can't wait for the next in the cities of love.
