minor spoiler<br /><br />underrated little stephen king shocker. it's not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination--even if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better, there'd still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with. the old micmac burial ground, rachel's terminally ill sister, and the jacob-marley-an victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent, and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed. but few horror movies really are perfect, and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock. `pet sematary' may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory, with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda. it's politically incorrect, it's tasteless, it's gratuitous--and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way `safer' horror movies never can. add to that one of fred gwynne's best performances and mary lambert's witty direction, and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie--even with the hokey ending. highly recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10.
