a longtime fan of bette midler, i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites. bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads. a literal rainbow of emotion and talent, bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the "bette of roses" album. spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone. the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around.
