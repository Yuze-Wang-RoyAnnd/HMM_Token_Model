chances are, you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it. but if, by chance, you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time (i'm well into the hundreds by now), you will find yourself spitting a line from it here and there and cracking yourself up! my friends and i have actually thrown fear of a black hat parties to get more of our friends, "as they say, down with the riots".
