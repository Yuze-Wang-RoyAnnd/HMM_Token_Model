in the sea of crap that hollywood (and others) continue to put out, this is one of those diamonds in the rough. a small, simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you didn't just waste an hour and a half of your life.<br /><br />ashley judd is really quite amazing in this movie. i had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of hers convinced me she's extremely talented.<br /><br />watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me so i was skeptical i would even care. i thought, "oh boy, some dumb chic flick or feminist male-bashing indie crap..." i was pleasantly surprised. without analyzing the many relevant themes, i'll just say, if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out. sometimes the down-to-earth, slice-of-life movies are the best, and this is a great one.
