this is unlike any other movie, the closest thing i can compare it to is a woody allen film... but where as woody allen is constantly fathoming human foibles bret carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse. in the case of lou, it is the root cause of his stuttering, which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs.<br /><br />there are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and i believe they all deserve a chance for redemption, although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place, so maybe we shouldn't fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or breasts.<br /><br />this is an indie film shot on a long shoestring, but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film. i feel like its a quirky gem for the self-help market. i really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next, i could imagine a career along the lines of woody allen or albert brooks, although usually when a guy like this breaks through, he goes off and makes " x men" and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they.... x men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly :)
