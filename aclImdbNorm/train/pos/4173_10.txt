a kind of road movie in old-fashioned trains in the slowenian late summer province. at the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth, and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases, you see that the trousers-part is missing on a flag of mourning (appearently his father has died). in the train he meets a young lady, and almost without words, but many small gestures, a wonderful love story begins. it's a somehow surreal, very poetic, and a little bizarre movie, with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents. beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
