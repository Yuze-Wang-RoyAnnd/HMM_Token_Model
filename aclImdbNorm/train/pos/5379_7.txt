there's a lot going on in the college girl murders. a mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas. before he can reap the rewards of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a hooded, whip-welding monk. after a co-ed is killed in a church by the gas, scotland yard is called in to investigate, but the killing continues. who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college? <br /><br />what works: <br /><br />- the killer. what's not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red kkk looking outfit, complete with red gloves. the white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown. although the idea of a killer in a flaming red, pointy-head outfit sneaking around a girl's school is fairly far-fetched, it's one of the more sinister looking costumes i've seen.<br /><br />- groovy 60s music. i really would like to track down the title music to the college girl murders. it's got a jazzy, hip, 60s feel to it that i just loved.<br /><br />- bizarre touches. beyond the killer's red gown and hood, the movie features a sliding fireplace, a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead, poison spraying bibles, a strategically placed mannequin, mini-skirts, go-go boots, and mile high hair. i would describe it as a cross between the 60s batman tv show and an italian giallo. the college girl murders is a real treat for the eye.<br /><br />- the end. let's just say that there are more twists than a mountain road. just when you think the killer has been uncovered, here comes a twist
