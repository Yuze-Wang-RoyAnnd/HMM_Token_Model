the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission. he plays a kind of "james bond's psycho twin brother", separated at birth, no doubt. as an intense hit-man, his character is very sexual but even better, very funny. add the kind-hearted, uber-likable american "guy next door', greg kinnear, to set up contrast. the myriad locations, vivid colors, and quick-witted humor provide great entertainment. hope davis is well cast as the "gem of a wife". but the focus of the film is on the two fellows, a new "odd couple", and that's the part that works very well. have a great (probably r-rated) laugh, and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper.
