this movie is one of those "wow!" movies. not because it's the greatest movie of all time, but because it surprised me. not only was it a t.v. movie, but it was on elvis. i can safely say as many impersonators as there are there was only one elvis, but i can also safely say that kurt russel came extremely close to being the real thing. it was one of the greatest impersonations that i have ever seen. he had me believing that it was really him. i learned a lot about elvis' life from watching this movie. and don't led the television part of it let you stray-it's actually a really fantastic film! and kurt russel could've been elvis' twin :)
