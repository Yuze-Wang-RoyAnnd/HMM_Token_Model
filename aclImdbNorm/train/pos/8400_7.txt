i picked this film up at my local library. having met the director at a film festival late last year, i was curious to "check out" his work. i was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />the film takes a fresh look at familiar subjects, love, infidelity, friendships, jealousy. it can be a bit 'talky' at times but never so much as to completely sink the film. i enjoyed watching a love story with characters that clearly belong together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than haphazardly "falling" into something as important as love.<br /><br />the contrast between this film and the average low-budget shoot-em' up black film is quite distinct. check it out. if you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine did. good stuff!
