i bought dark angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5. nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. i haven't enjoyed anything as much since firefly (also and amazing show). i'll admit season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see designate this, bag 'em, the berrisford agenda, harbor lights, freak nation etc.) and alec is great. i've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and i have to say, i can't believe it was cancelled - i won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). as proof of my obsessiveness, max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks i've had it, i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice. it's just too good.
