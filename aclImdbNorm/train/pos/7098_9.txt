"twelve monkeys"'s got all the elements to become terry gilliam's masterpiece. an outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. "twelve monkeys" is also the first movie where bruce willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in "die hard"). no matter how he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. the movie contains a very thrilling end too. it's got a real dramatic power. but this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). no matter how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
