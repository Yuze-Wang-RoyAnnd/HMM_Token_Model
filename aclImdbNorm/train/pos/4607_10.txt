my favorite jackie chan movie will always be "drunken master" (1978), followed by this film from 1985, "police story." in it, chan plays a hong kong super-cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (brigitte lin) so that she can turn state's evidence. as the story goes on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin, but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay. like "drunken master," "police story" has many of the signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts/action choreography that chan has become famous for, climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall. in his role as director, chan exceeds in excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action. while light on the overall slapstick humor of "drunken master," at heart "police story" is just that, a police story, a gritty cop-thriller that would be oft-copied over the years to come.<br /><br />10/10
