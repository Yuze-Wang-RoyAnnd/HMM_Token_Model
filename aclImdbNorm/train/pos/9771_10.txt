compelling and innovative! at the beginning of this criminally underrated whoopi goldberg flick the writers draw a parallel between theodore rex and the 1941 orson welles classic "citizen kane". the writers are justified in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallel, but the viewing public is too often hoodwinked into seeing overly hyped hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies. in "citizen kane" charles foster kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings, much like whoopi goldberg in this movie. this movie is about finding love in everybody's differences. it is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self-absorption. whoever paired whoopi goldberg and theodore rex formulated a dyad for the ages, with the only justifiable comparisons being bogey and bacall, hepburn and tracy and hall and oates. if you would love to watch an uplifting, celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity's deepest drives; bergman-esqe but not as depressing, theodore rex should be viewed immediately!
