rupert friend gives a performance, as prince albert, that lifts "the young victoria" to unexpected levels. he is superb. as we know, queen victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after prince albert's death and looking into ruper friend's eyes i understood. the film doesn't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life. an act of love. i believed it, or i should say, him. i believed what he felt was real. nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of friend's characterization. emily blunt is good but i didn't believe for a minute she was victoria. no real sense of period. it may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown.
