i rented this movie when it came out on video tape and really enjoyed it. i had the opportunity to purchase it on dvd a few weeks ago and have watched it several times since. i would have to agree with others when they said indian summer was nostalgic film. when i watch it i wish that i could be 10-14 again. i think that is why we all like the movie to some extent. we all at times wish that we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom/knowledge of adults. wouldn't it be nice to have all your friends/parents be young again? to not have to worry about your job, being a parent etc...??? i know that i would like to jump into a de lorean and go back in time. while i enjoyed the film very much my all time favorite camp film though is meatballs with bill murray. i wish that they could make an indian summer version of that.
