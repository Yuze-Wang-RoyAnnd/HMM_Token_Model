as i said in my comment about the first part: these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess.<br /><br />the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship.<br /><br />but when battlestar pegasus appears, the story heats up, carrying the battle back to the cylon planets. okay, it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth, but it works for me. it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects (even though those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-) ).<br /><br />i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board. instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen...<br /><br />so thumbs down for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978.
