the person who wrote the review "enough with the sweating and spitting already" has no grasp of what cultural, literary, or psycho- critique is. he dismisses zizek's interpretations because they don't seem "in line" with what the director originally intended. so what? the importance of a director's (or author's) intention is not important in critical theory. this is known as the author's "intentional fallacy" and should be avoided.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intentional_fallacy a text or movie can be analyzed through a number of theories, many of which disagree with one another, as well as completely ignore the author's intention. this is the most fundamental idea of critical theory.<br /><br />because of this, whoever wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort on insulting zizek. in reality, anyone who studies theory would immediately discredit this guys opinion (i suggest you should too) as it is completely off point.<br /><br />that being said... if you are at all interested in freudian, laconian, or kristevian discourse, this movie is a must. it connects these theories with popular film, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them.
