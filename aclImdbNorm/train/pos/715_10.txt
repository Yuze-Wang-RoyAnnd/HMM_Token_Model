all the folks who sit here and say that this movie's weak link is the ramones would probably say that amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist. rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones. how anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of joey ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddy-o. ms trogar, exploding white mice, the hall patrols...instant classics. nevermind the riff randell character.<br /><br />if you don't like the ramones then you don't know rock and roll and you don't deserve to watch a movie called rock and roll high school.
