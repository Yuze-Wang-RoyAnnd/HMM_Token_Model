great woody allen? no. good woody allen? definitely. i found myself, along with the audience in attendance, laughing hard and often at some of the best woody allen lines we've heard in a while. the aging allen created an appropriate role for himself as scarlett johansson's "father" ... well, sort of. some have said johansson plays "a young dianne keaton." i beg to differ. she plays woody's dialogue, which, in his comedies, always has a very similar feel...like, well, a woody allen comedy. that's fine for us woody appreciators. she certainly did woody's dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy, melinda/melinda. some may find woody's humor tiresome, but for those of us who love it when it's done right, we look forward to the next.
