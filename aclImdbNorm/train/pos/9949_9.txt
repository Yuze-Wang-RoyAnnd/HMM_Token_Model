this one is quite a nice surprise. cute little story of the heroine's quest, very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye prissy soon-to-be-spinster type into a raunchy dd-cup sex queen. <br /><br />visually a sight for sore eyes, not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for (most of) the costumes and make-up of the actors. an unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation.<br /><br />back to the positives: the movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera-shots which you would not expect in a soft core. loved that scene with the icicles, absolute classics potential. a slight minus only for (very) few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief. <br /><br />9/10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect.
