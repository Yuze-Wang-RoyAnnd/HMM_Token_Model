this movie was directed by victor nunez who also wrote the screenplay (ulee's gold). nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the independent spirit award, looking at ruby's day to day life. what we see is a slice in the life of the young woman ruby. ashley judd (sisters) won the independent spirit award best female lead for this role. ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. she explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. the movie won grand jury prize at the sundance film festival. as an independent film enthusiast i picked the movie because of sundance. i appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the hollywood baggage.<br /><br />although the stories are completely different this reminded me of nobody's fool, staring paul newman. the later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man. i like that. the story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. the only thing i am not sure about is the title. i am sure that there are not that many bugs, and flies in paradise as there are in florida. as i am allergic to mosquitos, florida is no paradise to me, i itch all over thinking about florida. i turn into a complete red boil. i recommend this movie! favorite scenes: ruby and her friend rochelle bridges, played by allison dean walking at the beach of panama city, florida. indeed the sand is very white. i have been there. favorite quotes: "necessity has always been a good excuse." "all that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now, who is going to be and when and why."<br /><br />
