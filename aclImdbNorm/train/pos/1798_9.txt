saw this saturday night at the provincetown film festival, and it's a stick-to-your-bones movie -- it's really stayed with me. adapted very smartly from what is probably an excellent novel, it's a back-and-forth-in-time drama with fully rounded characters, thoughtful rumination on life choices, and, i'm not exaggerating. one of the greatest casts ever assembled in 100+ years of movie-making. wonderful work from everyone, led by a luminous vanessa redgrave as a dying, deluded newport matron, and claire danes as her much younger self. meryl streep's daughter mamie gummer is, like mama, the real deal; patrick wilson looks like paul newman circa 1958 and doesn't overplay the charm; and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as barry bostwick and eileen atkins contributing sharp, detailed cameos. hugh dancy, also from the stage, doesn't bring much edge to the somewhat clich'ed role of an unhappy rich wastrel, and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow. but it's a deliberately paced, visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues, and you can cry at it and not feel like you're being recklessly manipulated. also, what a sumptuous parade of 1940s/50s automobiles.
