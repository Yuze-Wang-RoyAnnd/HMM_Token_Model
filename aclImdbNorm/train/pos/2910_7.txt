this is a great film for mccartney's and beatles fans!a splendid time is guaranteed for all.the audience (feat some celebrities such as nicholson ,cuzak,michael douglas) is ,as always,quite amazing:from small children to old campaigners of the sixties.they know the words to all the songs by heart ,and some of them are crying when paul breaks into "blackbird" "yesterday " "all my loving" and all the treasures of his catalog (who ,except john lennon and dylan ,can claim such a repertoire?).there are two particularly moving moments:<br /><br />-the double tribute to lennon and harrison;first "here today" performed solo (the title was included in "tug of war" 1982 and was its best track),then "something" when paul uses an ukulele.<br /><br />-"the long and winding road" rendition,a key moment,when paul's voice cracks ,as he is moved to tears by the hearts the members of the tour crew hold in front of the stage.<br /><br />i remember,in the early seventies ,when people used to despise paul ,cause he was not involved in politics,as his ex-partner was.they had to change their mind for paul is a committed artist: "fame is great cause it allows charity".the film shows different aspects of paul's activities ,an artist who is anything but selfish.
