given how corny these movies are, you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them. the movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there. the inhabitants were: author charles hillyer (denholm elliott (with hair!)), who gets haunted by one of his own creations; philip grayson (peter cushing), who gets a little too close to a wax statue; john reid (christopher lee), whose daughter's cuteness is apparently a facade; and actor paul henderson (jon pertwee), on the verge of getting a little too much into character.<br /><br />"the house that dripped blood" is actually worth seeing (well duh; it stars peter cushing and christopher lee). aside from just being neat, there might be some undertones: it might be calling into question the issue of real horror vs. assumed horror. like in "the shining", we might ask whether the house/hotel itself holds some memory of past events. and if absolutely nothing else, ingrid pitt (as paul's co-star) is hot hot hot! around the time that this came out, she also starred in "countess dracula" and "the vampire lovers" (also with peter cushing). maybe she - like barbara steele - will remain known only as a scream queen, but mark my words: she is a hot scream queen! i'd like to see ingrid pitt and barbara steele co-star in something.<br /><br />i guess that the only weird scene (so to speak) is where denholm elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. you read that right. what kind of a name is "denholm" anyway? oh well. a very cool movie.
