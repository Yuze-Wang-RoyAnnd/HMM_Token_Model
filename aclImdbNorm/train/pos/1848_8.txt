several years ago the navy kept a studied distance away from the making of "men of honor," a film based on the experiences of the service's first black master chief diver's struggle to overcome virulent racism. ever eager to support films showing our navy's best side the u.s.s. nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers, with supporting shore installations, were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor's battle with uncontrollable rage. some of the movie was shot aboard the u.s.s. belleau wood.<br /><br />antwone fisher wrote the script for denzel washington's director's debut in which he stars as a navy psychiatrist treating fisher, played effectively and deeply by derek luke.<br /><br />fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the u.s.s. belleau wood (lha-3), a front line helicopter assault platform. fisher can't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men. sent to the m.d. as part of a possible pre-separation proceeding, fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality.<br /><br />the story develops as fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, an enlisted sailor named cheryl, played by a stunningly beautiful joy bryant.<br /><br />fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers, however painful, in order to grow and move away from conflict-seeking destructive behavior.<br /><br />while all the main characters are black, this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings. viola davis, a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films, is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom, mrs. tate (novella nelson), who in short but searing scenes would earn - if it existed - the oscar for gut-churning brutality.<br /><br />films about patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability (all that transference and counter-transference stuff) but the earnestness of fisher and his doctor/mentor is realistically gripping. it's a good story, well told. period.<br /><br />while set in the navy, "antwone fisher" is not in any real sense a service story as was "men of honor," an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person. nor is it truly a film about blacks. it's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still "standing tall." the persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor.<br /><br />my only quibble is that washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander. with all the navy support people listed in the end credits, someone should have told director washington that his character, like all naval officers below the rank of commander, is addressed as "mister." not a big criticism, is it? :)<br /><br />i don't know why this film is playing in so few theaters. it deserves wide distribution. derek luke may well get an oscar nomination.<br /><br />8/10.<br /><br />
