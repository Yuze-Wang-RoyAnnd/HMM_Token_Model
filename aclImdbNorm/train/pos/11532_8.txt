well, this was one of those films i caught on the off-chance, and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time... if, like myself, you enjoy many 80's horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm (i.e. not just another glut of generic sequels) then i think you may enjoy this. when the bad guy eventually turns up in person, he was definitely not what i expected to see! all in all, i wouldn't go out of your way for this one, but if you like the genre, then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill, i guess. i'd give it 6.5 out of 10.
