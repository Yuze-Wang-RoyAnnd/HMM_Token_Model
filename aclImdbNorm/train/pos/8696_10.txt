one of the unsung gems of the 1980's, scenes... features razor-sharp satire and outstanding performances from arnetia walker (how did she not get a ton of roles after this?)and wallace shawn. it's a delicious send-up of class warfare and the people in those classes. the writing is hilarious and the characters, while not subtle, are nuanced. and, sorry, but the asian gangs (if you can call one japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a "gang") were not put in for "sociological value" as another review implies they should been. the value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it. i found it creative, funny, and idiosyncratic.
