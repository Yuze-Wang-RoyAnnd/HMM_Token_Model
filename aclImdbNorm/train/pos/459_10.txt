this is the best series of its type i've seen all year. i can't help thinking it's just my luck - a series i love gets 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant stream of cookie-cutter cop shows get never ending episodes.<br /><br />i think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many. the scripts are good, and the mix of characters superb, the acting is top flight, and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat. the stories aren't all that memorable, but that's not the reason i watch shows like this one. <br /><br />the theme song is a favourite, and we were disappointed to find it isn't available in any published edition. great stuff, bbc- a triumph of sense over sex-appeal (aside from the young constable nobody's there as eye-lolly, and even if he is, he can still act!).
