i am embarrassed to say that i missed "the mother" when it was in theaters. i saw it this evening on dvd. i gave it a 10 vote, one of the very few i have given here. this english independent is filmed with such great care and quality. it drew me in relentlessly. the story, low-keyed and purely human, is brutally honest and utterly absorbing, thanks to the acting of anne reid, daniel craig and cathryn bradshaw. the cinematography is stunning. the score is hard-wired to the plot. the storyline is epic, brilliantly clothed by writer hanif kureishi in mundane lives. this story addresses big issues with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. and some of those big issues are highly controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards won, despite many nominations. it is simply one of my all-time favorite films.
