this movie is a true masterpiece, it really is. it's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick, full of fun, laughter, heartbreak, and with a little drama to keep you on your toes. <br /><br />a true family film, homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets, who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners, following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way. one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good. shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise and brave, and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment. chance - who wouldn't love a dog like chance? he's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen. and sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper; 'here kitty kitty kitty... not on your life, chubby.' <br /><br />there were also lots of well made emotional scenes, such as sassy going over the waterfall (i was truly scared for her), shadow falling in the ditch (almost in tears) and then the fantastic ending, when all three pets return home... including good old shadow! <br /><br />a favourite for all time - anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals. rent it or buy it now, and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime.
