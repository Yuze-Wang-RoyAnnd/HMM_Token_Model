this is the greatest film i saw in 2002, whereas i'm used to mainstream movies. it is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. from the technical info (the chosen directors), i feared it would have an anti-american basis, but ... it's a kind of (11 times) personal tribute.<br /><br />the weakest point comes from y. chahine : he does not manage to "swallow his pride" and considers this event as a well-merited punishment ... it is really the weakest part of the movie, but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece. the weirdest comes from the mexican nearly conceptual-art film ... i am still not sure what a. gonzalez inarritu meant. the 9 others are perfect (k. loach, s. penn, s. makhmalbaf, ...) or nearly perfect (c. lelouch) and made me either smile, or cry or even left me stunned. i still don't know if s. imamura's fable is really related or not to the september 11th catastrophe, but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply 'makes it'.
