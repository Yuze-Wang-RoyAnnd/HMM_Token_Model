i know, that's not what you expect from a film with this sort of<br /><br />lineage- it's a direct descendant of the best years of our lives<br /><br />and the men... films dealing with men who are in the hospital<br /><br />dealing with tragic circumstances. but this film is full of wonderful<br /><br />surprises and performances. it features stellar performances from<br /><br />eric stoltz and helen hunt (including a rather risque nude scene)<br /><br />and wesley snipes and william forsythe. as emanuel levy wrote<br /><br />in his book cinema of outsiders (about the independent film<br /><br />movement) "the waterdance is coherant, attentive to detail, and<br /><br />unsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor- it' s at once<br /><br />funny and sad, and the entire cast is impressive." i was<br /><br />extraordinarily moved by this film, it's hard hitting yes, but also has<br /><br />very tender moments and laugh out loud moments. a rare gem.
