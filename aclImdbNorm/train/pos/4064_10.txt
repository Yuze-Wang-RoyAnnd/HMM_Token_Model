i never met a single person (out of hundreds) who hated this movie. bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur, or a victim of one. this film has everything. ask yourself, "are you a fan of. . . ?" then go see "laputa".<br /><br />it's not my favorite movie, but my favorite is directed by the same person (hayao miyazaki). in any case, this one ranks among my top five. and i've seen a lot of movies.
