i read the book and saw the movie. both excellent. the movie is diamond among coals during this era. liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw. this film should have made them stars. shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film. it could have easily been a franchise. release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film. look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. you won't be disappointed. do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). it'll blow you away. times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think they have.
