tillman jr.'s drama about the first african american navy master diver (gooding jr.), who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer. the screenplay is not bad, a bit extreme at times, but the direction and acting is first-rate, and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do. i liked deniro in the lead, although its not on par with his masterful works (taxi driver, godfather and all the others) it is as good as his other good performances such as in king of comedy or angel heart. deniro is always convincing and believable here, very good performance, gooding jr. is not bad, definitely one of his better performances. --- imdb rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
