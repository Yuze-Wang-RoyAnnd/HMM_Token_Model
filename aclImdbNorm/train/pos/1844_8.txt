i wasn't quite sure if this was just going to be another one of those idiotic nighttime soap operas that seem to clutter prime time but, as it turns out, this is a pretty good show (no small thanks to talented casting). four female friends with diverse backgrounds get together and share the weekly goings-on of their love-lives. the hour long program follows each of them separately through their often screwed up quests to find love and it does it without being boring or trite. sharon small's "trudi" is the homemaker one (allegedly widowed after september 11th) who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends (who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors). it's great to see small back on t.v., as she was great in the "inspector lynley mysteries". the chick can act. orla brady's character (siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic of the women, as she wrestles with her kind but self-absorbed husband hari (jaffrey, formerly of "spooks") in his driven desire to have a child with her, regardless of her needs. the final two members of the cast are the effervescent jess (shellie conn), an events planner who's a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone, gender not specific, and katie, (sarah parrish) a somber doctor who's affair with a patient and his son have sent her career and love life spiraling out of control. that being said, i'm hooked now and hope that the bbc continues cranking this series out because it's good, it's different and it's got a great cast.
