lin mcadam (james stewart) wins a rifle, a winchester in a shooting contest.dutch henry brown (stephen mcnally) is a bad loser and steals the gun.lin takes his horse and goes after dutch and his men and the rifle with his buddy high spade (millard mitchell).the rifle gets in different hands on the way.will it get back to the right owner? anthony mann and james stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, winchester '73 (1950).stewart is the right man to play the lead.he was always the right man to do anything.the terrific shelley winters plays the part of lola manners and she's great as always.dan duryea is terrific at the part of waco johnnie dean.charles drake is brilliant as lola's cowardly boyfriend steve miller.also wyatt earp and bat masterson are seen in the movie, and they're played by will geer and steve darrell.the young rock hudson plays young bull and the young anthony (tony) curtis plays doan.there are many classic moments in this movie.in one point the group is surrounded by indians, since this is a western.it's great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner.all the true western fans will love this movie.
