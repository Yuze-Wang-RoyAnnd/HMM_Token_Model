let me say that i love adam sandler, watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting<br /><br />when he raises his voice, i cant help but think of happy gilmore yelling at a golf ball, then i snap back as adam sandler sucks me in<br /><br />reign over me is a great film, a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene<br /><br />don cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an oscar in any movie he does<br /><br />adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic/best acted film of his career. but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film<br /><br />the supporting cast was great also with saffron burroughs and jada pinkett smith<br /><br />i would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of nyc great comedy great drama and a new found respect for adam sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance at how great don cheadle is
