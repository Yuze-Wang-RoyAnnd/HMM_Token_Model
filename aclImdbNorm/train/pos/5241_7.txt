excellent film from thaddeus o'sullivan featuring strong performances from a host of british and irish actors. the film deals well with a thorny subject matter, and effectively captures the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of 1970s belfast. surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict. on one hand, it shows a young catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the troubles. on the other it deals with a loyalist gang who are intent on propagating violence. very interesting and, thankfully, entertaining. don't be expecting any laughs, though. 7 out of 10.
