this movie is utterly hilarious. its cast clicks immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster films. the conflict of brother vs. brother appears when johnny's brother becomes a do-gooder d.a. however, the best character is johnny's crimelord rival, the overly accented moroni. as johnny says "that man should be arrested for butchering the english language."<br /><br />check it out on video. it's worth a look.
