if there were two more charming performers than peter ustinov and maggie smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968, i don't know who they were. i first saw this delightful little satiric gem 25 years ago at the age of 16, and i consider any year in which i have failed to sit down to watch it again a wasted one. it's intelligent, quirky, neat, wistful, sweet, gently subversive, and utterly enchanting. the romance of these two social misfits is both richly comic and terribly moving - never more so than in maggie smith's desperate attempt to bring up the right card in the deck, a scene that's both ruefully funny and a perfect thumbnail portrait of heartbreaking loneliness. and that final freeze-frame on the anxious, concerned, loving face of ustinov as he asks, "are you all right?" - has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly and nakedly honest? i would never want to know anyone well who didn't love this movie.
