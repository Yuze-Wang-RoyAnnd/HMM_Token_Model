i participate in a filmmaker's symposium, and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and participated in a 40 minute discussion. even though it was incredibly late and we were weary, the entire audience really enjoyed it.<br /><br />personally i thought the film was hilarious in all the right spots, and i loved the quirky cast of characters. they really grow on you in the film.
