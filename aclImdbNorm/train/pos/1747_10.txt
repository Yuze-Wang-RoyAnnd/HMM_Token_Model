this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year. i didn't see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. it is similar to anchorman in the humor department, but i think this is a better put together movie. it actually has a point. if you are going to see a whole bunch of t&a you will be disappointed. just a well put together movie!!!! if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. i definitely think that ebert and roeper's review of this movie is right on. i mean, i don't really like ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that i will agree about. the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny.
