only seen season 1 so far but this is just great!! a wide variety of people stuck on a island. nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets .... it sounds like melrose place meets the crusoe family and why is that so great ? it probably is not but then ad a spoon full of x files, a dose of "what" ?? and a big "hey" and a island that is everything you ever dreamed of - in your freakiest nightmares and you'll be lost to. the story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable. great set up, solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human (well almost everybody ... i think ...)with good and bad sides. but weird oh so weird ...
