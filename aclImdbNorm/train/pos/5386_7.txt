this film is one that played very well back in 1932 and probably wouldn't work as well today because its style it a bit old fashioned and contrived. however, if you are the sort person, like me, who adores older hollywood films, you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it is--an interesting soap.<br /><br />the film is set in a ward for problem pregnancies. in this large room are about a half dozen beds in which women are waiting to give birth--but doctors are concerned about possible complications (yikes--such a room would really traumatize the mothers!). and, like an episode of "love boat" or "fantasy island", each mother has her own special story. with so many rather extreme and crazy stories, you have to suspend disbelief. i could and enjoyed the film quite a bit.<br /><br />here are a few of the stories: one involves a father. you don't see the mom, but he is a very, very nervous father and it's included for comic relief. however, he was wonderful here--very touching.<br /><br />loretta young and eric linden are a sad case. loretta is sent to the hospital from prison--she apparently killed some horrible guy. you don't know exactly what occurred, but you assume he was trying to force himself on her! yet, she was given a 20 year sentence--and her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much as he can.<br /><br />glenda farrell is an awful person. she has the maternal instincts of a hamster--a really, really bad and alcoholic hamster! she is pretty funny and worth seeing through most of the film. i loved her drinking from a hot water bottle filled with gin as well as becoming upset when she learns she can't make money selling her twins!! late in the film, she has a typical hollywood-style change of heart that was supposed to be touching--i found it contrived.<br /><br />there is a woman who has given birth to a still-born baby. amazingly, afterwords, they put the lady back in the same ward as the women waiting to give birth!!! a crazy woman, who you assumed lost a baby some time ago,wanders down from the psychiatric unit. she insists she's having a baby. later, she escapes again and actually takes one of the kids!<br /><br />there are most stories than this but the ones i mentioned are the main ones. as i said, it's a soap opera of sorts and is highly entertaining--and quite sad in the case of several of the stories. the ending, in particular, is heart-breaking and exceptionally well done. there were a few particularly good performances--especially farrell and aline macmahon as the head nurse. all in all, a very good film--and i have no idea why they felt they had to remake the film just a few years later (which was typical for warner brothers).
