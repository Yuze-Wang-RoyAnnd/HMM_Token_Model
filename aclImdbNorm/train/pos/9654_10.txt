stephane rideau was already a star for his tour de force in "wild reeds," and he is one of france's biggest indie stars. in this film, he plays cedric, a local boy who meets vacationing mathieu (newcomer jamie elkaim, in a stunning, nuanced, ethereal performance) at the beach. mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother, demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). soon, the two are falling in love.<br /><br />the film's fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs, bits and pieces of the present, and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting. director sebastien lifshitz doesn't signal which time-period we are in, and the story line can be difficult to follow. but stick it out: the film's final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. by turns heart-breaking and uplifting, this film ranks with "beautiful thing" as must-see cinema.
