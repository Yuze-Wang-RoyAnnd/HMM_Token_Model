it's funny. it's not arthur miller or t.s. elliot, but man this is funny. kline and fields are great. (her toss-off line "god, you are so disgusting" as she climbs in his window - great! kline's running into the door after scoping out teri hatcher - great too!) robert downey jr. and kathy moriarty work together flawlessly - until he finds out who she really is... a soap opera turn if there every was one!<br /><br />the scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and i rolling on the floor - that scene alone is worth the rental price.<br /><br />doesn't solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime t.v. (i hope). just a lot of fun.
