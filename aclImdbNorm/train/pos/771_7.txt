i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. so i had views from all kinds of directions. mainly, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu. yes, i do think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate. there were good romanian actors around, they just didn't have complex roles. i applaud puya's entering the movie business. i don't know why, but i think he's a good guy, i just hope he'll be a good actor.<br /><br />the wife loved the movie, though, and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for. if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania, then it failed miserably. there were no consequences. just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot.<br /><br />i have no idea why it got all those bafta awards. in my book, it should have gotten the "better luck next time" award. (bafta=good luck in romanian).
