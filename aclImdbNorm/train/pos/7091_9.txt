the big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow. but good there is also a pause-button. bruce willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996. thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990, then in the first world war and how messed up it all might look like, terry gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. this ex-monty phyton man knows exactly how genius sf-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better, there is the lunatic brad pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb bruce willis who proves he is more than some schwarzenegger-wanna be. it's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises. one of my big favourites.
