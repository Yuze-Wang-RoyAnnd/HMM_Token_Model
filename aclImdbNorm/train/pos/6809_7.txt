this was a pretty good film. i'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but i didn't want to take a chance. anyway, near the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a scripture verse and then quotes another from memory. i can't remember the first passage he reads, but the second one is genesis 9:6. he says it's genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. this is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment. it's too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the bible today. did anybody ever hear of john jay, the first supreme court justice in the history of this country? he said that the bible is the best of all books. too bad we've lost that view in america.
