i watched the un-aired episodes online and i was so sad that the show won't be back. it had the best cast of mature, talented actors and an amazing chemistry. it seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life. towards the end the show became engaging, sexy and highly watchable. of course, some of the story lines are not realistic, so what... the characters are all likable and you root for them. the show reminded me a cross between 2 other favorites: "sex and the city" and "felicity". big kudos to all the cast. note to abc execs: nielsen ratings reports do not show you true results. the show audience will mostly record it. i've been very disappointed with major networks for flooding us with reality-tv or teenage oriented shows. why to get a mature, thoughtful, well-acted material we have to switch to hbo or fx? i can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online. the new stream media will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
