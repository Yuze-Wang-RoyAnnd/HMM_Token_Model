the horse is indeed a fine animal. picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick.<br /><br />the animation is simply stupendous. the fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden across the flick. more so when the stallion traverses diverse terrain, jumps across cliffs and braves waters. <br /><br />soundtrack too is very impressive. the wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie. <br /><br />"they say the story of the west was written from the saddle of a horse . " huh? well ,the story of a fine horse sure was written from the saddle of the west .<br /><br />all in all, this movie is clearly up there with the best .it is one of the best animation flicks i have watched. would be a very fine choice on a lonely night. an easy 9/10.
