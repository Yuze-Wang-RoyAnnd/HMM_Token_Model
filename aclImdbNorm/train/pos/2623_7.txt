i actually like the original, and this film has its ups and downs. here's just a few:<br /><br />ups: most of the original voice cast returned.<br /><br />downs: i didn't like the voice of timon's ma. i know she did a voice in the simpsons, but that show is just plain stupid. <br /><br />ups: we get to see simba as a "teenager."<br /><br />downs: they wasted it with a slug-slurping contest between timon and simba. <br /><br />ups: it was rafiki who told timon about "hakuna matata."<br /><br />downs: how did pumbaa find out about it?<br /><br />ups: songs again. (some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music.)<br /><br />downs: but stupid songs. (a.k.a. timon's solo.)<br /><br />overall, this is a pretty good movie. i'd recommend it for fans of the original. but if you don't like the original, chances are you won't like this one.<br /><br />my score: 7/10
