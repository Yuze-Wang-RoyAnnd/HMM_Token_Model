an original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the library of congress, and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. according to current reviews that i've found online, the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the new york state censors. i have also read that a dvd is "expected in 2006" and one can only hope! if we're really luckily, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. note that the released censored version was originally available on laserdisc, which i have seen. stanwyck rules!
