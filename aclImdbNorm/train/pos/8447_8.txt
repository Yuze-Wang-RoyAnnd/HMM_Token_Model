in all truth, this really isn't a "movie" so much as an extended final episode; by this i mean that, had you not followed the tv series (homicide: life on the street) i suspect that you would have a hard time following this made-for-tv movie. having said that, "homicide: the movie" is still a great watch. i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return, many after years of absence, to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program. the movie brings out that sense of "family", not only amongst the characters, but amongst the actors, as well. it's all very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the last time we will see them all together again under the title of homicide. story-wise, i found this film somewhat lacking. giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived, and i felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position, as leiutenant. also, det. bayliss's extreme plot twist, which was left hanging at series end, is finally resolved, but i, for one, never felt that it needed to be; i enjoyed being left with a mystery (let us recall that the very first episode's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run!). as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie, and the fact that it even got made after h:lots had been canceled, but i would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series. now, if they'd just release it on dvd...
