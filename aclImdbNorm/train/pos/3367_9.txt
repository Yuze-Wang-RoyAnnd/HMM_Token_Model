this film has great acting, great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you fit in, whether you accept to play a role or break free... there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects. i want to comment on the formal setting of the film. basically, it's two people on a roof. there is unity of place and time, with 2 protagonists, and the radio acting as the choir. many directors have turned greek tragedies into film, many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, has succeeded as admirably as ettore scola in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting. a masterpiece.
