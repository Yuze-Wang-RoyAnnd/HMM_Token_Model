now days, most people don't watch classic movies, such as this. most of friends only watch movies from the '90s to present. thats kinda stingy. <br /><br />most old movies like this are masterpieces, unique in their own way. only because, back when these movies were being thought of and made, thats when ideas were fresh. now people strain just to think of new ideas. <br /><br />anyway, to the movie. for true fans of classic horror. this is for you. the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor, and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house. <br /><br />i won't say anymore, for i will ruin the movie more than i already have. but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is. and would never mind watching it again!
