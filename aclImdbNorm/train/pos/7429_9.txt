she is such an extraordinary singer, who cares about anything else!!!! that final scene is one of the best moments in all of show biz - bar none!! i'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes - she deserves that iconic status - such is the power of the voice. <br /><br />i first saw this film when i was five and it had a huge impact on me. i see it today, and yes, i can see some of the flaws (like esther wanting to leave the grammy's right as her award is being announced).<br /><br />but some of the other user comments are just plain false - i mean, where is the gratuitous nudity - maybe we saw different films??? <br /><br />streisand's singing ability is monumental, and if she has a big ego - fine! <br /><br />she's earned it.
