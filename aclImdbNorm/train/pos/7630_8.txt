kurt russell, whose career started when he kicked the real elvis in it happened at the world's fair, will probably never top his performance as the king in this biopic helmed by slash and shock meister carpenter. there are times you feel that you're watching elvis until something snaps you back to reality...perhaps memories of a hapless don johnson in elvis and the beauty queen? all the performances here are excellent: season hubley as priscilla, pat hingle as the colonel, even shelley winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to her rendering of momma presley.<br /><br />kurt's dad bing is here playing elvis' father vernon, and there's a fine understated performance from robert gray as elvis' buddy and bodyguard red west. <br /><br />a must see for rock n roll fans.
