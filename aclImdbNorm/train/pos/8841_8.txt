'before the devil knows you're dead' is one of the best movies i've seen in a<br /><br />long time. the acting from<br /><br />the excellent ensemble cast is incredible. philip seymour hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time he's on screen. ethan hawke matches him scene for scene and albert finney simply chews up the screen. marisa tomei is, however,<br /><br />criminally underused, but looks amazing for her 42 years. the script is excellent, the story-line non-linear but easy enough to follow. sidney lumet, although not known for his blockbusters, has turned out a gem with this one!
