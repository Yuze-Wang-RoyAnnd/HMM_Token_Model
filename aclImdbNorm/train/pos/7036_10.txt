got to be one of the best political satires i have seen to date, with an excellent performance for cusak, tomei, and all the supporting actors.<br /><br />excellent plot, very well-placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end. the action scenes were well filmed & choreographed. very funny.<br /><br />all in all i give this film a big thumbs up. it's extremely critical of us military intervention in the middle-east, and as such, it may receive bad reviews from people who don't share the same political view, or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour. indeed, at places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic.
