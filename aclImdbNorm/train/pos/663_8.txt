i have watched this episode more often than any other tftc episode, it is that enjoyable. and it is quite scary, but all in good, ghoulish fun. a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged santa claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment. mary traynor, who i seem to remember from snl or some other tv comedy skit show, is the evil wife, and larry drake plays the lunatic in the dingy santa outfit. i had forgotten santa was played by drake over the years. his santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times. you can probably guess how santa finally gets into the house. the episode is played for laughs, but it also can be pretty intense at times.
