a female executioner (played by the sexy jennifer thomas ii) has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker. and what a way to go. lucky this film is not real, or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row.<br /><br />it starts out real slow. low light and bad acting, like most (b) films. it gets better as it moves along. and ends with a bang.<br /><br />i would rate it very high on the low cost, very sexy movies of the 90's. it's a must see once the kids are away or in bed.
