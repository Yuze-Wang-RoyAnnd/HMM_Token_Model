just got out and cannot believe what a brilliant documentary this is. rarely do you walk out of a movie theater in such awe and amazement. lately movies have become so over hyped that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens. amores perros did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing to me now. i didn't know a thing about this before going into it and what a surprise. if you hear the concept you might get the feeling that this is one of those touchy movies about an amazing triumph covered with over the top music and trying to have us fully convinced of what a great story it is telling but then not letting us in. fortunetly this is not that movie. the people tell the story! this does such a good job of capturing every moment of their involvement while we enter their world and feel every second with them. there is so much beyond the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tense. touching the void was also a great doc about mountain climbing and showing the intensity in an engaging way but this film is much more of a human story. i just saw it today but i will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen.
