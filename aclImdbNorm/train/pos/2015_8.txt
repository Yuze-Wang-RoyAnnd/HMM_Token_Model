this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall it's a very enjoyable, light-hearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time. highly recommended for it's feel-good factor alone. ok, so frank sinatra's "acting" leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film. sinatra went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this, his first venture into hollywood, his voice, not his acting, is his main contribution to this movie. i've just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago.
