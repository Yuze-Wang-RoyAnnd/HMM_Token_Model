sabrina the teenage witch was one of my favorite t.v shows of life :d i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school. so far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. melissa joan hart plays the perfect teenage girl/witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to. she's funny, smart, outgoing, witty, and a lot more. caroline rhea and beth broderick both fit the part very well as sabrina's aunts. zelda, the intelligent scientist, and hilda the crazy, wacky one make a perfect balance in sabrina's life. though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years, but that doesn't mean they weren't still good. i think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped, it made sense and i loved it anyways. :)
