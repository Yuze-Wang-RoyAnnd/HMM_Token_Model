matthau and lemmon are at their very best in this one - everyone else in the movie are also great. the dialogue is excellent and very, very witty - and the scene where lemmon's character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time i see it. anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original. i recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - i just love it. and the fact the jack lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion. these two great guys made a string of movies together, but this one is the best - no doubt.
