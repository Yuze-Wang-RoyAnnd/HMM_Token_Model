first off, i'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the best picture academy award was 'gigi' in 1958. that is misinformation as 'west side story' won in 1962, 'my fair lady' won in 1965 and 'sound of music' won the year after that. that said, this film is absolutely fantastic! the story from the novel has been somewhat altered, but that's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didn't change back for a filmed version. however, i don't mind. in fact, i rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does. i like nancy bringing oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment. the subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh. i love the moment mr. bumble and mrs. bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office. the underscore for that moment is brilliant. my three favorite actors for this film were jack wild, who plays the best dodger in any film version of the story, ron moody, a playful and humorous fagin (this character is worked out much better than he is in the book), and shani wallis, who is the strongest, most distressed version of nancy. the only reason i'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are 'concider yourself' and 'who will buy.' i always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs. it looks awful and cheesy, especially when they're dancing at the london meat co. they should've just done regular choreography for these scenes. however, this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.
