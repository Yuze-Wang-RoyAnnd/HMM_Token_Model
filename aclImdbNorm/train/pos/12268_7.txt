seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear.soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy vietnam veteran."trampa infernal" is a pretty entertaining mexican slasher that reminds me a lot "the zero boys".the film is fast-paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neck.unfortunately there is not much gore,so fans of grand-guignol will be disappointed.however if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look.mexican horror flicks are quite obscure(i have seen only "alucarda" and "don't panic"),so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher.my rating:7 out of 10.highly recommended.
