once a year "comes" a movie like that and makes things easy for you. you don't have make an effort to think it is good, it's just is. you enjoy it while you watch it, and you take it home with you. i can't say it is totally flawless, but it's near. acting - great, story -interesting and with elements of suspense. it's a small family story, pretty much predictable, but it's not the secret itself that matters. it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it. i was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). the only thing i didn't like that much is the actress that played the mother, she was too tough and without necessity. keren
