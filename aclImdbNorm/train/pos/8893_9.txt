the 60's is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot. in four deliveries, we follow a north american family, with 3 members. but we don't only see them. we also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend, an extremist student leader, and a soldier in vietnam. the filmography is just extraordinary. in the first chapters, we see some shots of the vietnam war, in between the scenes. the next chapter, doesn't start where the last one finished, it starts some time after, giving us a little mystery on what happened. in general, the 60's mini series, is a must see, not only for hippies fanatics, but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic.
