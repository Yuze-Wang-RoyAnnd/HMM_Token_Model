i was pleasantly surprised to find that how to lose friends and alienate people was nowhere near as 'gross-out' a comedy as the trailer had led me to expect. i rapidly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained engrossed throughout. pacing of the more visual humorous content was, i thought, spot on. (i mean i got the impression i was witnessing pegg's attempts at restoring lost control very much 'in real time', so to speak.) at other moments there was time allowed to share the main protagonists' (i.e. pegg's and dunst's) reflection on how events were affecting them and what had led them to where they now found themselves. all the characters were well cast, to some extent interesting in and of themselves, and generally quite likable. (any apparent ruthless ambition displayed tended to be tempered by a corresponding good natured resilience.) an entertaining, intelligently scripted, brilliantly directed and superbly acted film that i would thoroughly recommend.
