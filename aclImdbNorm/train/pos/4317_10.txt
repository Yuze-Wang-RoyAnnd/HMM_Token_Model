i really liked this film when it was released, and i still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general, and people too...one of the things i like about the films of lawrence kasdan. in addition to the positive vibes from the film, there are other reasons to like grand canyon. for one thing, it has an outstanding cast...kevin kline and danny glover, for example. in my opinion, crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the oscar for best picture, was very similar to this film. the difference is that grand canyon leaves you feeling positive. crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. i would choose grand canyon over crash any day.
