i tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now i've seen the film!! what a ride! and what a trip to finally get to know darius weems! such a courageous, wise, funny and talented spirit! and what a crew! to listen to darius laughing from being in the water at panama city, to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. this film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. and the crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. they got darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility problems; they took darius on the trip of his life; and they touched many, many lives. by raising awareness of dmd and encouraging funding for research, this film will help accomplish the final goal of darius goes west - a cure for dmd.
