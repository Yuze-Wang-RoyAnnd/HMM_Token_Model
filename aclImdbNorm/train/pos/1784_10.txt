evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth. all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances. with the tremendous cast, though, one expects stellar acting, but in this movie the expectations are exceeded. one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family. as one watches the interaction of the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought to mind. this is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book. usually it is the other way around; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan minot book and read it. the rhode island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack. any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles. needless to say now, but i recommend evening highly. see it you will enjoy it.
