ho, ho, homicidal maniac! this spirited tour-de-force adaptation of a great ec comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable tv series ever made. director robert ("back to the future") zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by fred ("night of the creeps," "the monster squad") dekker which centers on a ruthless two-timing housewife (well played by mary ellen trainor, who was married to zemeckis when she starred in this episode) who kills her jilted jerk of a husband (a nice cameo by marshall bell) on christmas eve by whacking him upside the head with a fire-poker. complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly kris kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit. alan silvestri's spooky, stirring score and dean cundey's typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun. and larry drake (the sweet gentle giant benny on "l.a. law"!), with his creepy hiccuping guffaw, a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes, and a leering, truly wicked grin, makes for a sensational sanguinary saint nick.
