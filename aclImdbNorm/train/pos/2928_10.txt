eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand-up concert film i have ever seen. most stand-up acts usually have lulls at some point, but not this one folks. for 90 min there is not one moment that is not side-splittingly funny. from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead-on impression of mr.t, the laughs are non-stop.<br /><br />sadly, this was done in 1983, and eddie hasn't done anything nearly as funny. it's unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show, wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at all.<br /><br />eddie, if you're out there, please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious. believe me your fans will love you for it. and i think you know that.
