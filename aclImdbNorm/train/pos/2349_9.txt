it is a pleasure to see such creativity on tv again. this show is poetic, artistic and good fun. the characters relate well and the writing is not bad (i think it will improve as they get their legs). definitely worth a look.<br /><br />the girls steal the show so far in this series. chuck is adorable as is olive. the two aunts are a delight. i sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic.<br /><br />well, that's all the news that is fit to print. go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way. this is like dr. seuss for adults.
