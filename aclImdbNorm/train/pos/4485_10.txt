this is my favorite of the older tom & jerry cartoons from the early 40's. the original version with mammy two shoes is on the tom & jerry spotlight collection 2 set, disc one, and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons. the gags on this one aren't all madcap avery style, but more subtle and aimed at anyone who's ever stayed up late watching scary movies (or radio programs)! tom is listening to a creepy radio show, and jerry decides to play a number of tricks to spook him. the nine-lives gag is well done here, and i don't know how many times i tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when i was a kid. when tom's owner is awakened by the ruckus- mammy was not the maid, it was her house- she gets one heck of a surprise, with a big laugh. get your pause button ready, it's worth it!
