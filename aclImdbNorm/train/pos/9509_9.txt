wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. i really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace. i thought the pace was perfect. the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit-man/ killer working for john rooney (paul newman). he disslikes this job but does it because rooney payed for his house and helps him financially. he had nothing and mr. rooney gave him everything. but, his children are unaware that this is his job, and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him, he is placed in an awkward position. and when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge. they rob abanks and much more and build a bond. they're the perfect team. hanks does a great job as always as well as jude law who plays his creepy role to perfection. this drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were.
