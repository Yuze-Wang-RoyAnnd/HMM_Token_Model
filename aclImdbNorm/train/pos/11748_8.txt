tripping over. i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but having faith in the show, and abe forsythe's unquestionable talent, i continued to watch. i can safely say i'm now glad that i did. the story did develop quite well, and all the characters have a strong base, and most don't have any information missing.<br /><br />the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie.<br /><br />some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line. here's to hoping for another season!
