pickup on south street (1953), directed by movie maverick samuel fuller, contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication. subway rider candy (susan peters) collides with pickpocket skip mccoy (richard widmark dipped in shades of sinatra cool). she's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm; mccoy is unaware of grifting it. both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents. thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges. candy is doubly watched (skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; skip, the overconfident petty thief, is singularly unaware, trailed by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless. they can't stop the "passing" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
