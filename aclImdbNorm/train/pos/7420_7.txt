although kris kristofferson is good in this role, who wouldn't want to see elvis pressly instead? with the drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame may have scared away elvis' agent to be apart of the movie, it was a mistake. this would have been a perfect movie for elvis. even though the soundtrack is far from terrific, paul williams and barbra streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this "period" piece / musical. somewhat of a love story, this is more of a drama about the fall from grace and the gift of redemption. like is most tragedies, the hero of the story was die. also, gary busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role.
