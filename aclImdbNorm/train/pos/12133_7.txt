this movie is about sexual obsession. bette davis plays mildred. this is a woman who men are drawn to. not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity. now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious. there is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her. she works as a waitress in a coffee shop, she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt. it is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her. one day phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her. he starts buying her things even pays for her apartment. meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it. he dreams about her like she is a angel, but she is no angel. he is constantly thinking about her. his med school grades are even failing. so what the nookie is too good. he wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy. she always lets phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time. he is heart broken but he meets another woman. they seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the bimbo. mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed. phillip takes her in again, but she starts going out with a friend of his, the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out. she does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him, well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up. oh we have a club foot that he has problems about, even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it. he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for mildred. well he has no school tuition, can't find a job. finally sally and her dad takes him in. not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill. soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor. meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again. she has tb. meanwhile he is still leading sally down the primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship. finally the bimbo dies and phillip declares he is free now and he will marry sally. i wished she told him to stuff it. now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points. but i feel phillip was the bad guy. yes mildred is a strumpet but he knows it, and he keeps coming back. mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers. i guess the sex wasn't as good. but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred. not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he intends to do about baby ( apparently the baby's name) he laughs is off, he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy. sally's father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist. philip doesn't seem to refute his feelings either. men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed. yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain. to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred.
