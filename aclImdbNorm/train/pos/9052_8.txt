this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films. it is another solid based-on-a-true store, which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes. frankly, i don't know but i liked the story.<br /><br />the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else, including his father, does in this west virginia town. the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which i think was overdone. i would like to have a little less tension between the two.<br /><br />the young man, still a boy, is played by jake gyllenhaal, one of his first staring assignments, i think. he's likable, as are his school buddies in here. it's nice to see nice kids in a modern-day film. the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper (the dad) and laura dern (the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time.)<br /><br />the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear. once again: i wish there more of these kind of films made today.
