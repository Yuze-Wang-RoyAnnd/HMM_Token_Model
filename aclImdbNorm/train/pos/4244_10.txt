this film has slipped through the cracks of film history. it is by far much better than some other new york films of the same era such as: "the french connection" or "the taking of pelham 1-2-3". there is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line. it's engaging from start to finish and hasn't tarnished with age as is the case with the above two examples.<br /><br />ron liebman turns in a bravura performance as "batman" and it's a shame his career didn't take off as a result of this project.<br /><br />gordon parks directs and, coming as it does after "shaft", it at first appears to be a strange choice. yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face machismo.<br /><br />unfortunately this film has not been made available on either dvd or vhs in the united states. united artists really has a gem on their hands and it's a shame they're not doing anything with it.
