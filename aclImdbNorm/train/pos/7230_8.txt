"the invisible mouse" is a delightful and different tom & jerry's cartoon. it features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time. jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of "surprises" for tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him.<br /><br />as much as it is weird, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see: jerry invisible. it's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts. it's equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible. i really like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible.<br /><br />some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerry's shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes "missed me". i also like when jerry drinks tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face.<br /><br />overall, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too.
