"fido" is to be commended for taking a tired genre, zombies, and turning it into a most original film experience. the early 50s atmosphere is stunning, the acting terrific, and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning. suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars, "eisenhower era" dress, art deco furniture, and zombie servants. it would be very easy to dismiss "fido" as cartoon-like fluff, similar to "tank girl", but the two movies are vastly different. "fido has structure, a script that tells a story, and acting that is superior. make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed. highly recommended. - merk
