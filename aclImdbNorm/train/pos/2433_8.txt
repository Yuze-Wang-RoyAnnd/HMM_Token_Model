i was about 12 years old when i saw this classic "casper the friendly ghost" cartoon. figured it was an early one since casper didn't look *right*, the same way porky pig doesn't look *right* in the old 1930's cartoons. but i digress...<br /><br />anyway, this episode in the friendly phantom's afterlife concerns him befriending a young fox todd whom he names ferdie. i remember being happy to see casper have a friend, as those who have watched the cartoons are wont to know that most people run away from him, screaming "a ghost!"<br /><br />casper and ferdie have some fun together until someone else shows up... i hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler, but the cartoon is only seven minutes long, so you can't really be too ambiguous. besides, anyone who reads the imdb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what happens next...<br /><br />the finale is a bit heartbreaking. in fact, it's probably the saddest i've ever felt watching a cartoon. but that only means that it moved me, which probably explains why i decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not very many others. or heck, the fact that i actually remember this cartoon at all is due to its emotional effect on me -- i haven't seen it since. but the cartoon does end on an upbeat note, and i was pleased to see casper and ferdie happy again.<br /><br />i'd give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. second only to the warner bros. cartoon "peace on earth," this is the most i've ever been moved by an animated short.
