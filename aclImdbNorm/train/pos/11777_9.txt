"jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but europeans did, and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines". --- it is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn't understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book. please don't ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness. the reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned. please read the book as is it a great source of information. i enjoyed it a lot. this book is even a taught as a text book at some universities.
