this is my favorite all time movie. it used to be my friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when i was single. i first saw this movie with my aunt brend and sister chasity. i was in the 2nd grade. i fell in love with travolta and sissy was my new best friend. i've read a lot of comments about why bud left sissy & how sissy has to "learn to act" married. but let's go back and look at this for a second: spoiler - my interpretation of the movie now, not when i was eight is this about bud & sissy's relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at gilley's riding the bull. they get in a huge fight. bud tries to make sissy jealous by asking pam to dance. sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and wes asks her if "she needs any help". they're all on the dance floor acting like fools when bud asks pam, "when are you going to take me home and rape me?" pam answers: "when ever you're ready cowboy". bud then goes home with pam to her condo in downtown houston. which daddy has bought for her with his oil money and "all that that implies". bud is the one who cheats on sissy. sissy is waiting for bud when he returns home the next day. sissy is the one who leaves bud. then, it's up to bud to prove to sissy that he is a real "cowboy" and win her back. <br /><br />anyways, that's my interpretation. everyone has their i'm sure! i love this movie.<br /><br />and believe it or not, i got myself a real cowboy! i love him too! :)
