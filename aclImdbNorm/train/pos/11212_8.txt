this picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of sheriff buford pusser. bo svenson takes over the role of sheriff buford pusser, and luke askew plays the role of mobster pinky dobson. the last that we saw sheriff pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed sunday morning drive. after pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife. is pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes. the only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story. how could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don't do anything about it. since there was real no name actress in this picture i can't give it 10 weasel stars but i can give 8
