the literary genius of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice. the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander, an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction. nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted. she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket. a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day, the mother alarmed telegrams the husband. he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past, ala' godfather ii, where we see young alexander, a child prodigy. he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums. thinking alexander reached his peak, abandons him but becomes legend. the old teacher returns causing harm, trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander. in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality, the chess clock ticks, match time ends to conclude the next day. that day is nastasya's wedding, the old teacher interferes and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. nastasya, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves. though the film unfortunately sways from its russian roots, its low back cut dresses are lovely, alexander plays his role sublimely.the director underestimated her audience, we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens, isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws & king, sacrificing the castle for mate. nastasya is a great match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her. the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor, the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.
