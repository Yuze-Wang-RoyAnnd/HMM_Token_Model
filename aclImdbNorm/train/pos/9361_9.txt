reign over me (titled after the who song) is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost everyone's eye. it was a moving story of a guy (sandler) that lost his family in the 9-11 world trade center attacks. years later, he runs into an old college roommate (cheadle) that he doesn't even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress ensued by the loss of his family. the two rekindle their old friendship and cheadle's character, johnson, realizes that he must get sandler's character, fineman, some help before it's too late.<br /><br />this was the first movie that has made me cry in a long time. it's completely worth watching and after seeing it, i'm positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more.
