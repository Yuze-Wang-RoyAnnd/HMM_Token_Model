a surprisingly good movie! it has quite a few good jokes thru out the whole movie. the only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extremes to show just how stupid the two main characters are. we get it, stupid blondes, get on with it! <br /><br />the plot just barely dodges being called "corny". and boobies are always a plus altho the movie for some strange reason doesn't play with that card very much even tho the plot line introduces two black haired women who act as the evil counter part of our two blondes.<br /><br />so all in all, a good movie to watch. i almost gave it an 8/10, but let's not get crazy.
