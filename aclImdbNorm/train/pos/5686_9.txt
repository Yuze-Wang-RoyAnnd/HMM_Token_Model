*wonderland spoilers* <br /><br />july 1st, 1981: five people, ron launius (josh lucas), susan launius (christina applegate), billy deverell (tim blake nelson), barbara richardson (natasha gregson wagner) and joy miller (janeane garofalo) are attacked while they're asleep and brutally hit on the head with steel pipes in their home at 8763 wonderland avenue, laurel canyon, la. only susan survives.<br /><br />main suspect: john holmes (val kilmer), former king of porn, owner of a 30 cm long dick, and now a hopeless addict.<br /><br />two investigators, luis (frankie g.) and sam nico (ted levine), are investigating on the case and try to crack it with the help of a witness that claims to know that john at the very least took part in the murders, david lind (dylan mcdermott), barbara's boyfriend, and trying to get a witness report out of dawn schiller (kate bosworth), holmes' 19-year-old girlfriend and from susan, who sadly doesn't remember anything more than shadows about the night her husband's head was bashed in and hers almost suffered the same fate, and the name of eddie nash (eric bogosian), a major drug kingpin (who is always around ladies such as barbie (paris hilton)), comes into light as a suspect planner of the wonderland massacre.<br /><br />but what did happen that night? and could sharon (lisa kudrow), john's wife, know something about it? 'wonderland' is a taught, intense thriller, a desperate love story and a story of a man's sad decline all in one; there is a clever use of the 'rashomon' technique (we see the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of david, john, dawn, susan (albeit very briefly) and sharon), a nice direction and a great script, but is mostly compelling for the performances, especially kilmer's, who takes central stage with his hopeless, tormented, sometimes childish holmes, lucas', whose launius is strangely alluring, kudrow's strong sharon and bosworth's innocent dawn.<br /><br />wonderland: 9/10.
