i just saw this episode this evening, on a recently-added presentation by one of our local independent channels, which now presents two episodes each weekday.<br /><br />as the gentleman opined in the other, previous comment here, i agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series, but i find it entertaining nonetheless.<br /><br />my father was a friend of one of the principals (in my hometown, cincinnati), for whom young rod serling had worked in the media there -- and i remember dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there. overall "twilight zone" is certainly one of the true classics in television, and given its production during the height of the cold war period, provides not only a view of this era in the country, but also (today) a nostalgic picture of production techniques, creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago.<br /><br />* minor "spoiler."*<br /><br />this particular story depicts, as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story where the locale is meant to provide a "surprise" ending. sometimes the characters are on earth, from elsewhere, while the story at first implies at least one is an "earthling." these usually contained the message (as here) of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this cold war period.<br /><br />viewed today, stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint 4-5 decades ago, and still provide some food-for-thought. -- as did this episode.<br /><br />while the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads, it still presents a simple, important message, and a worthwhile 20-some minutes of entertainment and interest.
