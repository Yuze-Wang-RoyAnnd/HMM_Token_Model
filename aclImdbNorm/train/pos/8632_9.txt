this is a comedy of morals, so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs, but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything.<br /><br />this film, marvelously written and directed, is a gem that shines perfectly, with beautiful acting by all. jean-louis trintignant is exquisite as usual, and romy schneider is a pearl, perfect and glowing, that is not to be missed. a truly wonderful film !!
