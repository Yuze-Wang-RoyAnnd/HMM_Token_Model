this is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago. it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered.<br /><br />clothes and music might have changed over time, but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up-to-dateness. and especially this movie does the job pretty well. of course it is cheesy at times, but very touching as well.<br /><br />jodie foster's performance is striking, and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies.<br /><br />don't miss this one.
