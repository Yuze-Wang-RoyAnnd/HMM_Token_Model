i knew i was going to see this when i saw the first preview. dennis quaid was one reason, but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me. people talk about this as a movie for kids, but i think it's a movie for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging, infirm parents, our own mortality, our kids growing up and leaving us, and all the other things we never thought would happen to us. <br /><br />the movie doesn't fall into the trap of tragedy; it's about what living your dreams means when you have a real life. <br /><br />quaid is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good, and rachel griffiths makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful, layered performance. the camera-work is slow and sweet. when they put this movie together, they left out anything that wasn't necessary. very nice.
