even though this was a disaster in the box office, it is my favorite film. it gives a powerful message of family. it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan. if you want to see the indian godfather, amitabh portrays that in this film. don't read reviews by critic, they're just ignorant. this movie has good mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon na(still good movie), this is the movie.
