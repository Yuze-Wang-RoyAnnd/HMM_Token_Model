uneven bollywood drama. karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend (sanjay kapoor), has a child, and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords. drama and tragedy ensue, and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller. film is compelling, its few song/dance numbers are uninteresting and needless, the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film's drama, at least once we've left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest
