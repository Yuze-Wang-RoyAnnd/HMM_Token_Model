offbeat, slow-paced, entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. however, it'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains, or to ignore krabbe's first-rate performance. verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with the meaning of the hero's visions-omens. unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur, and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie.
