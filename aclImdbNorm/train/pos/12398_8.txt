what was always missing with the matrix story was how things came to be in the real world. say no more, because this part of the story covered most of the bases. what was truly interesting was how political it was, maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration. fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde, who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity. what i also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown. we as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often, letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people can't believe the contrary. well represented and put together, this a true testament to how illogical humans can be.
