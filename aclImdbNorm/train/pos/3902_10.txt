i'd heard of eddie izzard, but had never seen him in action. i knew he was a transvestite, and when i saw he was on hbo one night last summer, i put it on, not knowing how my husband would react. well, he blew us away. he's better than robin williams ever was. he has total control of the audience; when he does the 'englebert is dead - no he's not', routine, the audience doesn't know what to think by the end. god as james mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the python spanish inquisition as carried out by the church of england - 'cake or death?' is priceless. my jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show. we scoured the tv listings for months after that to be able to see him again, and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on. if you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything and tape it, you won't be disappointed.
