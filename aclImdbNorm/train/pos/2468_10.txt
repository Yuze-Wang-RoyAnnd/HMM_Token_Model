i went to see hamlet because i was in between jobs. i figured 4 hours would be great, i've been a fan of branagh; dead again, henry v. i was completely overwhelmed by the direction, acting, cinematography that this film captured. like other reviews the 4 hours passes swiftly. branagh doesn't play hamlet, he is hamlet, he was born for this. when i watch this film i'm constantly trying to find faults, i've looked at the goofs and haven't noticed them. how he was able to move the camera in and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. this movie was shot in 70 mil. it's a shame that columbia hasn't released a widescreen version of this on vhs. i own a dvd player, and i'd take this over titanic any day. so columbia if you're listening put this film out the way it should be watched! and i don't know what happened at the oscars. this should have swept best picture, best actor, best direction, best cinematography. what films were they watching? i felt sorry for branagh at the oscars when he did a tribute to shakespeare on the screen. they should have been giving a tribute to branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time.
