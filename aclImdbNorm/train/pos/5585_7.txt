this was a very daring film for it's day. it could even be described as soft-core porn for the silent era. it was a talkie, but dialog was extremely limited, and in german. one did not need it anyway.<br /><br />the young (19) hedy lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive (stereotype?) german and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated, returns home to her father.<br /><br />in a famous and funny scene, she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another. she is then forced to run across a field chasing after it, as she left her clothing on the horse. an engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing - after getting an eyeful.<br /><br />they sit for a while and, in a zen moment, he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. this is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. she knows this man is different.<br /><br />she returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow, and finds the ecstasy she was denied. you can use your imagine here, but his head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure. since he never got undressed, you can imagine... certainly, an homage to women by the director gustav machat'y, and a shock to 1933 audiences.<br /><br />the only thing that mars this beautifully filmed movie is the excessive guilt, and a strange ending.
