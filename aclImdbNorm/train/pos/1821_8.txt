when i was a little girl (and my dad owned a video store), this was among my favorite movies. i hadn't heard much about it since then, nor did i really remember anything about it, it having been forgotten in the wake of don bluth's other, probably better films. i managed to track it down a few weeks ago, however, and was pleasantly surprised again. set in new orleans in the 1930s, the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable. there are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough, but they generally don't detract from the storyline, which leaves you smiling (and maybe even a little misty-eyed, if you are a lover of animals). the characters are believable (maybe even a little too grown-up for younger watchers), as well. two paws up, and for those of you who haven't seen it in a while, definitely worth a re-watch.
