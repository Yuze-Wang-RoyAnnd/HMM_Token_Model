scott is right. the best 2 person sword duel ever put on film is in the middle of this movie. the sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good. however, the fight in the middle is the best even compared to japanese samurai movies. chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the japanese in terms of entertainment value. especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies, japanese movies excel, example being the lone wolf and cub series. even though duels in japanese cinema last only seconds or a minute at the most, the sheer intensity of those moments made them better. but, this is one example where chinese swordplay surpasses the japanese. the scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography ever. the other fights in this movie are good too but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 for that one scene. if you haven't seen it, you have to. john woo is the man.
