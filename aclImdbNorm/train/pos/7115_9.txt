a wonderful and gritty war film that focuses on the inner torment of blinded marine al schmid. although it is tough and unpleasant it is in the end heroic - schmid's triumph over disability and depression. the battle scene was superb. but one bone to pick. no matter how many .50 bullets they fired i never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts! it hurt the realism, but i can live with it. fine performance by eleanor parker, again, as his girl friend.
