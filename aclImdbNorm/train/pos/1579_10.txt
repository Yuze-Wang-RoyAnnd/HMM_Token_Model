i saw this film at the toronto film festival, where it received a standing ovation! this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before--namely about the rosenstrasse (a street in berlin)uprising of german gentile women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war. as such, it is a unique story, and what's more, is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans (the helping family in "anne frank" for instance was dutch) who did not support the nazis, and, in fact, had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the nazi regime, at the risk of their very lives. the acting is great across the board, the framing story in new york interesting and intricate, the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene, and the production values, including the gorgeous cinematography, outstanding. of course the family in new york could be speaking german. many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family--a common occurrence. so that criticism is unwarranted. to say more would spoil the experience. the film is long, but i did not look at my watch once. i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america, for not only is this film a masterpiece, but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler. if this film is playing in your area, i urge you to see it! you will be glad you did!
