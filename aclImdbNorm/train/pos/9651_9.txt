what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me, on second viewing, a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation.<br /><br />spoiler of sorts follows.<br /><br />poor cedric; he apparently didn't know what hit him. poor audience; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. these two guys just didn't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach.<br /><br />on a purely technical note, i loved the camera action in this film. subtitles were totally unnecessary, even though my french is "presque rien." i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more. this was a polished, very professionally made motion picture. though many scenes seem superfluous, i rate it nine out of ten.
