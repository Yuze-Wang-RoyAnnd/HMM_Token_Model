i've seen this movie on several different occasions. i find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it.<br /><br />type 1: old people. a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest-to-goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval japanese dialogue. as soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences, the old people walk out, usually disgusted.<br /><br />type 2: film snobs. these people think that just because a movie bears the label of "independent" that it will automatically be a load of hard-to-follow, overemotional crap that may or may not be in english. yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured. they are really in for a surprise when they see this film. as soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime-inspired sword battles or the over-the-top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation, these people will be so dismayed, they will walk out. a few will stay just to see "how bad it will get" and later they'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends.<br /><br />type 3: people expecting to see live-action anime or matrix-like special effects. sorry folks, the martial arts are pretty solid in the film, but director yamasato really doesn't have the budget for that kind of thing.<br /><br />type 4: people with no expectations. these are the people who really enjoy the film. whether they had only heard of blood of the samurai, picked it at random, or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is: entertainment. this movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought, it was meant (if i may borrow a line of dialogue from the film) to "really kick some ass." and that's what it does.<br /><br />so depending on what type of person you are, you may or may not enjoy this film; however, if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting, then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends.
