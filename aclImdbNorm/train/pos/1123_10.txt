i really enjoyed this one, and although the ending made me angry, i still give it 10 out of 10.<br /><br />four college girls (baltron, kelly, stahl and cadby) are driving down to florida, on their way they meet 2 guys (turner, davis), they really add nothing to the plot, but are at least somewhat likable. the girls agree to meet the guys in florida for some fun, but they have car problems and never make it. one of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay by the car.<br /><br />soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes. soon she witnesses as a man (march) strangles a woman, in terror the girl flees the area, she doesn't get very far, but manages to get lost.<br /><br />her friends by the car go looking for her, they too go into the woods and run into the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man responds by shooting the girls head off, the other girl runs away, manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed.<br /><br />eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested. this is when i started getting mad, these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops don't believe them.<br /><br />they are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell, the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without getting in dangerous situations.<br /><br />this movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene imitating psycho, graphic violence towards women and solid story. some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will not like the ending, but over all, this is a great little unknown movie.
