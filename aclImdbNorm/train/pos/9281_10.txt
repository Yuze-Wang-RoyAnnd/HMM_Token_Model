i don't know how and where do the iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. in fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way jafar panahi did.<br /><br />the film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br />it makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match. you will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. it's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending, you will want to find out the verdict, you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls.<br /><br />i like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. it's like venus vs mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like iran.<br /><br />this is the second movie of jafar panahi that i have seen (the first being crimson gold) and am looking forward to watching some more.<br /><br />am already hooked with iranian movies and this one is a must-see!
