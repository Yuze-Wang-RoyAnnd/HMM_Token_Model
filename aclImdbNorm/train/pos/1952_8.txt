i got to see the movie " on thin ice" on the television in india.. i must say the movie was really well done, and really sent a chill down my spine.. the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted...<br /><br />however, i felt that diane keaton was at her best... the scene where she has cravings, and begins rummaging her home for cocaine... was the best... the two boys are good, and lynda boyd also showed what a good actress she is....the script is well done as is the cinematography and direction.. and casting<br /><br />a must must watch movie..... for everyone
