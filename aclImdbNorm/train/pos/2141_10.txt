masayuki suo, who directed this fine film, is on a role. after the decent "fancy dance" and the classic (in japan, anyway) college-sumo comedy "shiko funjatta", suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing success.<br /><br />the story is engaging. we both laugh often (naoto takenaka is hilarious, as he is in suo's two previous films) and really root for the characters. but to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into japanese society - real life in japan. suo has a knack for showing real-life activities with entertaining flair. the result is a movie that will pull you in, make you laugh, make you think, and both entertain you and give you insight into today's japan.<br /><br />also look for the the main 8 actors from shiko funjatta, as they all appear again in various roles, from supporting characters (takenaka) to short cameos (many).
