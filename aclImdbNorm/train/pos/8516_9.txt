this movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. when the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.<br /><br />this is positively the best work that leslie nielson has ever done. his idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative, and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh.<br /><br />the little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that i know i will never forget her. just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /><br />such great family entertainment is so rare these days. if you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings,go for this one! i could watch this over and over, and i often do! my only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy.
