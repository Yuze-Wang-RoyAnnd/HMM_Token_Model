when i first saw this show, i thought it looked interesting. i watched it, saw how it revolved around sarah, like the character sees the world...revolving around her. i got it, but wasn't laughing very much.<br /><br />onstage and in her show, she's racist, crude, insensitive and hugely self-centered. i didn't get her at first, and took it all at face value. then i got to see her movie, jesus is magic. i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me, explaining to me just what 'language' she's speaking. she's like marilyn manson, working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images, but you eventually realise it isn't an assault, it's a statement. and once you understand that, you find you're glad someone's finally giving it to you straight.<br /><br />i don't mean to suggest only smart people will understand, or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy. while i like a lot of 'smart' shows, i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm. i get the impression that it's good, but i just don't get it. many people will never get the sarah silverman program, but i'm glad i eventually came around.<br /><br />the creators of this show do work hard, every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot, but with songs, or dream sequences, production numbers. these people aren't putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers, they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. if i was to predict the future of this show, i'd say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks & geeks. it will get canceled before it's time and live on in fans' hearts and on dvd. but take heart, ssp creators, your audience is out there, and we'll be watching for as long as they let you make the show.
