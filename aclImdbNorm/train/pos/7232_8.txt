after the usual chase scene, jerry accidentally winds up inside a bottle of invisible ink, which was part of a chemistry set. he quickly discovers he's invisible...so the predictable results occur, meaning he uses his new hidden condition to torment tom. jerry often is just defending himself, but often he has sadistic streak in him that torments the cat whenever possible, even when unprovoked.<br /><br />here, he makes tom think his eyes are deceiving him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears before his eyes, or milk from a dish. tom can't take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off, but jerry sets fire to his paw! man, i hope little kids didn't ideas watching these cartoons back in the '40s and '50s! i always found jerry, the little mouse, more evil than cute.<br /><br />thankfully, in cartoons, generally, whatever damage a character suffers is gone within seconds and he's back to normal. <br /><br />the best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way through when tom figures out what the story is with jerry, and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is located (such as putting flour on the floor to see his footprints).
