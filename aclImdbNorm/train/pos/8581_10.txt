this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. all of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. it shows us that real life and "ficticious" action can produce a winning combination. also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other. name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like "they're going to find your anus on a mountain on mars."
