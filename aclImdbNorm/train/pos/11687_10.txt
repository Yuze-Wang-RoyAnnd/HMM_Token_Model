my fondness for chris rock varies with his movies,i hated him after lethal weapon 4,but i hated everyone in that movie after it.i like him when he is himself and not holding back,like in dogma. well this is his best yet,wasn't expecting this to be that good.laughed my arse off the whole time. chris rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedy i've seen in quite some time. loved it.
