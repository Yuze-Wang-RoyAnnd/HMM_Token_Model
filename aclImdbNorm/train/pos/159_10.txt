this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival. but unlike "yes", by sally potter, which i had seen some days before, where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive, this time quite the opposite thing happened: there was something that dragged me down, and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe. it was as if, all of a sudden, there was nothing left, all hope, all future had been taken away to a dead place.<br /><br />nina's life seemed to be dismal and locked, but then, one lovely day, there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams. there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion, just out of nothing, someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life. that person was toni, a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots, just like herself.<br /><br />but the film's title is "ghosts", and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, there is no way to retain them
