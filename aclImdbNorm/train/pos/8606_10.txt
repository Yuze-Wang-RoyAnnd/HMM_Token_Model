it appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical. it's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel.<br /><br />jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight. at one point, she gets to sing a snippet from carmen, followed by the final trio of faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then "aloha oe" on the beach! <br /><br />it's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove.
