the book on which this movie is based was excellent; it took a while to come to grips with houellebecq's unconventional style but once i understood the mood behind the writing i was completely drawn into the author's world of sadness. in fact, no other book has affected me so much. this is not necessarily a good thing - it elucidated my own personal struggle and has made the futility of my own struggle harder to accept. houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by harel and the hero's apathy and indifference to a world which has rejected him is perfectly portrayed. this is a movie which reveals today's society for the lowly male in all its horror. hopefully, things will change in the future but for the present we have to accept the rat-race as shown in this movie. it's probably best that harel or houellebecq do not create a work of genius like this again. one is enough for any man.
