i'm sitting here nov 2006 and i still can't help rave about this movie. arnold's best movies came in about a 4-5 year span. running man, predator, and total recall (1990). all 3 are amazing. the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion. i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall. they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in 2017, but you can't help but snicker at the 80's style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtv's. also the computer graphics of the "the running man" game show intro would not look like that in 2017. nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic. not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today's movie's. i really think that arnold's acting is much better than he's given credit for. now i would not have elected him governor but that's california for you. buzzsaw, dynamo, fireball, subzero are fantastic "stalkers" as well and i find the producers don't try to overkill the fight scenes. when the stalker is dead...he's dead. it doesn't go on for 20 minutes each. the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don't try and overplay it. i give this movie a 10/10 and that's coming from someone who doesn't enjoy a lot of movies these days. if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you'd see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
