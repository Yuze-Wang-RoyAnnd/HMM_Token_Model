it's a shame that this piece of work wasn't acknowledged as a piece of work. it has everything a historical film must have: a serious historical research, outstanding performances of every actor involved and a discrete but great direction.<br /><br />when i saw the movie i knew it should be a prototype for every biographical movie.
