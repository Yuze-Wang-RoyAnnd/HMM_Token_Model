this film caught me by surprise. my friend told me that this movie was a "chick flick." boy, was he wrong! this movie has a great family appeal, with no sex scenes like _other_ movies. jake gyllenhaal does an excellent job in homer hickam's shoes. the supporting cast is great, as well.<br /><br />science, coming-of-age, family quarrels, a great train scene... this film has it all. the soundtrack is good, although the score is presented quite choppily. the 50s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness.<br /><br />the dvd is definitely worth its weigh in coal. replay value is great - i've seen it quite a few times already.
