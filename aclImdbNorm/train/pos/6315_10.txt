welcome to collinwood is a lot of things, but it is none of the following:<br /><br />a george clooney star vehicle unfunny un-original<br /><br />and yes i know, the basis for the movie is another movie. but as far as hollywood goes, this may rank with their most authentic outputs this decade - and for me, it does.<br /><br />the movie is from start to finish, an absolute gas. here's why.<br /><br />there isn't a bad performance in the film. the funny parts are funny. the edgy parts are edgy. the script contains, not a dull moment of dialogue the cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful. and it doesn't conform to the hollywood norm (you'll see what i mean, when you see the film)<br /><br />when i was a kid, i remember seeing advertisements for the film. this film went under the radar after not grossing much at the box office, and isn't even a cult classic. the reason why transformers 2, is seen as acceptable by average movie goers, is because they are used to seeing transformers 2. if film's as original and funny as this were pumped out as often as multi-million pieces of s**t, the cinematic experience would be a much fresher place - <br /><br />when 'they' say they don't make em like they used to, 'they' didn't see welcome to collinwood.<br /><br />a fun, mini-masterpiece of caper comedy, that refuses to compromise. one of my favourites.
