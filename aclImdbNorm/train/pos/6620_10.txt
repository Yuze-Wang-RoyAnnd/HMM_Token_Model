if the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this excellent movie. i've just seen it a couple of hours ago here in paris (where the action of the movie takes place)and i can still feel the huge trauma i received in the back of my eyes...what a visual shock ! i've never seen such a beautiful black&white photo and such a drastic change in the way of doing animated movies. i strongly believe there will a before and after "renaissance", similarly to what we saw with pixar movies or the akira and ghostintheshell experiences. this is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies and i hope this french initiative (a small unknown french studio with a few young folks who had a dream named "renaissance"...) will receive the success and recognition it deserves. vive la france !
