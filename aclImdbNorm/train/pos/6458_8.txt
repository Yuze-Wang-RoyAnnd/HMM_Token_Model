a beautiful film, touching profoundly up the simple, yet divine aspects of humanity. <br /><br />this movie was almost perfect, and seeing as nothing in this world can be truly perfect, that is pretty good. the only minor thing i subjectively object to, is the pacing at some points in the middle of the story. the acting is also very good, and all the actors easily top actors in high-profile films. the actual directing seems to have been well thought through, and the script must have been amazing. there are some truly breathtaking moments of foreshadowing, and a quite gorgeous continuing circular composition of the story.<br /><br />the moment in the movie, when the main character achieves that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn.
