this movie blows you off your feet. this debut movie from tom barman (known from the belgian rock band deus) introduces you to 8 intriguing people, building blocks of a compelling movie mosaic. they each survive one day and one night in the metropole of antwerp. barman paints his characters with great deal of verve and competently interweaves their individual stories, a tour the force that reminds of the best work of robert altman and paul thomas anderson. the patchwork of anecdotes surprises, moves, amuses; the dialogues are so natural, they seem to be improvised. some great performances by matthias schoenaerts, natali broods and the extremely funny duo from ghent, jonas boel and titus de voogdt. sam louwyck is the memorable "windman", a bizarre guy dancing throughout the movie. sam is also responsible for the stunning choreography, and of course tom barman himself took care of the ultra cool sound track. we were seriously impressed: any way the wind blows is a movie that blows you off your feet.
