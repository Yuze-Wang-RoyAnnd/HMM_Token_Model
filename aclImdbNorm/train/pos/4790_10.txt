upon the straight story release in 1999, it was praised for being david lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal. based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a john deere '66 mower, at first glance its an odd story for lynch to direct. yet as the story develops you can see some of lynch's trademark motifs coming through.<br /><br />lynch's focus on small town america and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as blue velvet or twin peaks, but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down. the restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that i can think of that features a g rating. incredibly significant, this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced.<br /><br />the straight story was the first feature which lynch directed where he had no hand at writing. for many lynch devotees this was a huge negative point. almost universally acclaimed, the only overly negative review by james brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism, that it wasn't a typical lynch film. "lynch is struggling within the mold of a g-rated story that isn't his own." brundage claims, with his protagonist alvin straight "quoting lines directly from confucious." he argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse. yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film. whilst it is true that it is not lynch in the sense of eraserhead, lost highway or mulholland drive - all films which i also adore, the straight story features a different side of lynch that is by no means terrible. if you are a lynch fan, it is most important to separate that side of lynch with this feature.<br /><br />the narrative is slow and thoughtful, which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination. alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife, children and his brother. yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks, which only adds to the effect, which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents. the conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch. the natural landscapes of the us are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by angelo badalamenti, makes me yearn to go to america. the performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and richard farnsworth is particularly excellent. his oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win. regardless, however it is probably the finest swan-song for any actor. <br /><br />so whilst the straight story features none of lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue, the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended!
