if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england. other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with alfred molina, joan plowright, polly walker, josie lawrence, jim broadbent, miranda richardson, and michael kitchens in the major roles. under the brush stroke direction of mike newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye. reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too. an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us.
