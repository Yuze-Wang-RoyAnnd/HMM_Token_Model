... hawk heaven for lovers of french cinema and by extension french screen actors/actresses. at its worst it's an indulgence, actors getting to bitch about other actors, question the validity of acting as a profession at all, etc whilst at its best it's a glorious celebration/send-up of some of the finest actors currently working. from a simple premise - jean-pierre marielle's request for water being ignored in a restaurant - blier spins off in all directions and allows the cream of french cinema to strut their stuff before the camera even throwing in nods to those no longer around (jean gabin, lino ventura) including the director's father, bernard, one of the great stalwarts of french cinema, from whom he fields a celestial phone call at the end of the film. discursive and prolix, yes, guilty as charged but also something of a guilty pleasure.
