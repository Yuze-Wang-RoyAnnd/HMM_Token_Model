does any one know what the 2 sports cars were? i think robert stack's might have been a masseratti.rock hudson's character told his father he was taking a job in iraq ,isn't that timely? i have had dorthy malone in my spank bank most of my life ,maybe this was the film that impressed me.loren bacall sure did have some chops in this film and probably out-acted malone but malones's part made a more sensational impact so she got the oscar for best supporting role.was loren's part considered a leading role?old man hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of tycoons of his era in that he was a regular guy who made it big in an emerging industry but in building a whole town he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them up.in time,being widowed he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten,looking for attention,so rather than try to relate to his children he blew his head off.an ancient morality tale.but seriously,what were those sports cars?
