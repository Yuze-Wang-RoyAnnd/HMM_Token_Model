i will never forget when i saw this title in the video store way back when. i was always a big weird al fan and when i saw this video i rented and watched it. i was too young to appreciate all of al's subtle humor and satire at the time but i remember it much later when i was old enough to understand what i was watching. if you are an "al" fan, especially of his earlier work, you will thoroughly enjoy this film. it is done in the mtv-esque "rockumentary" style and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) tale of how al got to be where he was in 1985. you will love it if you like his brand of humor and, more importantly, his music.
