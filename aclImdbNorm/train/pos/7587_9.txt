i must say i was impressed the cinematography was amazing, the frames close to perfection and the way he built up the tension around a subject that sound more like a dreadful bore is beyond be.<br /><br />the film is about two narrators, one seen, one unseen. they are both trying to explain the significant of a series of painting that caused a scandal a long time back. the film is all about theories and explanations of views but the conclusion is quite shocking i must say. definitely a film that deserves more than it's 171 votes.<br /><br />with only 66 minutes to play out it's plot the film still felt like a complete work. fantastic direction! i must say far better than blood of the poet which it for some strange reason remind me a bit of. <br /><br />i suppose you can call it by the slang word "artsy". it's pretty much just a lot of professional talk about various theories and stunning visual effects but the crew and ruiz did pull it off. at least for me. an amazing film.
