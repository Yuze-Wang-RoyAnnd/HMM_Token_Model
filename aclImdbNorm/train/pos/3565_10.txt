guys and dolls is a unique play based on the characters. sky masterson<br /><br />(marlon brando) is a high-class gambler who takes up a bet with nathan detroit (frank sinatra) for one-thousand dollars. nathan needs the money so he can<br /><br />run his usual crap game and make a fortune. the bet was that sky wouldn't be able to take just any girl to havana, cuba and the "doll" he chose was sarah<br /><br />brown (jean simmons) who was in charge of a missionary. sky finally bribes<br /><br />sarah enough to go to havana with him. they end up falling in love with each other, but later she accuses him of something he had no part in. nathan ran a crap game in the missionary the night they were gone. nathan's 14 year fianc'e adelaide (vivian blaine) disapproves of nathan's gambling and tries to stop him from doing it. however, when the movie ends it all ends happy with a double<br /><br />wedding.<br /><br />the songs in this movie are just wonderful no matter who sings it. marlon<br /><br />brando has no singing voice at all and true they could have dubbed him but it didn't really matter. he did a wonderful acting job (obviously seeing as it's brando) and played his character very well. i have seen a few movies with jean simmons and thought that this movie was her weakest one, she also couldn't<br /><br />sing at all. however, the singing is made up by frank sinatra, vivien blaine, and stubby kaye. vivien blaine and stubby kaye was also in the original<br /><br />broadway production of guys and dolls. vivien blaine had a terrific voice and was the perfect adelaide. if you like musical, and even if you don't, i advise you to watch this.
