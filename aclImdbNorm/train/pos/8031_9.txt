this is one military drama i like a lot! tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett. this marine is no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done. there you have billy zane("the phantom" and others) who plays richard miller, a former swat form d.c., works for the government and takes orders only from them. who needs a bureaucrat? i don't! when these two are paired, sparks should be flying. and how. however, beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works. when the other sniper hits, it's wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. and when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him. who needs politics when you a pro like beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. the movie was a direct hit. watch it. rating 4 out of 5 stars.
