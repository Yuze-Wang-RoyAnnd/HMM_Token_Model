series three- blackadder the third " if you want something done properly, kill baldrick before you start" hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the prince regent, a vain and stupid foil for blackadders venom, played by hugh laurie. baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw. the format is similar to the previous show, after all now they had found the winning formula why change things. we see blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways, trying to make bladrick an m.p.or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince. in many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically, the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times. samuel johnson, william pit and wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes, not an easy thing with such a stellar cast
