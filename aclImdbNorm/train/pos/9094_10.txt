i saw this independent film when it was in philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. i left the theater with a smile on my face. one of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story -hilarious! it has some great character actors in it too. mindy sterling is in it and is very good. i loved her in austin powers. howard hesseman is also terrific. i remember him from head of the class. i am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made. this is fun and light, and i can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed. i keep checking to see when it will come out on dvd. i will definitely buy it.
