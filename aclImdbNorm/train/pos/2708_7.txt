after being sent to prison for no less then 10 nor more then 40 years for being busted with drugs and refusing to give up her accomplishes, jackie (erica gavin of russ meyer's "vixen" and "beyond the valley of the dolls", in her last film role) has to get accustomed to life in the big 'doll' house, or at least try to, in this early film by jonathan demme. due to it's tawdry nature and sheer watchability, i would also rank this as one of his best films, right below "silence of the lambs" and "stop making sense", but so far above any of his other movies. this minor classic is just campy, sleazy, and fun enough to be an amazingly good guilty pleasure and thankfully never once goes overboard into all out parody of the women in prison genre. it almost washed out the rancid bad taste of the ludicrously preachy "philidelphia" from my mouth. however, the film is not without it's downfalls (the 'un'talent show is a huge chore to sit through and goes on far too long, barbera steele is sadly wasted, among other small things) but don't let those gripes stop you from watching an otherwise enjoyable movie.<br /><br />my grade: b- <br /><br />dvd extras: 5 minute roger corman interview; cast & crew bios; original trailer; and trailers for "candy stripe nurses" (with nudity), "big bad mama 2", "big doll house" (with nudity), & "crazy mama" <br /><br />eye candy: juanita brown, cheryl "rainbeaux" smith, erica gavin, roberta collins, ella reid, lynda gold, and some others all show skin
