doghi is a wonderful movie and renuka daftardar is excellent. so is uttara baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles. along with kairee, its an example of marathi cinema at its best. there are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic - it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered in. these scenes probably emerge from the film-maker's political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not need it. but apart from such minor quibbles, its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one i strongly recommend. sumitra bhave's concern and humanism shines through.
