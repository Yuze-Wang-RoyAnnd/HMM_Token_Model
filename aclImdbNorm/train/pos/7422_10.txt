as a long-standing barbra fan, any posting like this will be biased. that aside, this film ranks as a classic. it has it's flaws (emphasized in other postings), but gives a glimpse of a time (late 70s) that will never be there again, and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen.<br /><br />streisand fought hard to make this movie her own. i don't think she was ever satisfied. but it gives her fans a new barbra (for the time) with live singing, a young fresh appearance, and some very heavy-duty acting.<br /><br />the story is rough, but exciting, and holds your interest throughout. the extended one frame "finale" is hard for most non-barbra fans to sit through, but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent.<br /><br />
