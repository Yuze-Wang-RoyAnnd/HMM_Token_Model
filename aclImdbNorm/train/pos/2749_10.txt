a good picture is worth all the words. this film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of about people with down's syndrome. and i won't spoil it by telling you. you'll want to see it yourself.<br /><br />pasqual duquenne is an amazing actor. i did not need to understand a single word he said to understand his meaning.<br /><br />the film has a magic of it's own. after watching it i understood better that we put too much value on achievement and not enough on the people we love. passion and simplicity is all we need.
