finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen. well, we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers, andy (played by hoffman) and hank (played by hawke) will spiral downward towards destruction since where else is there to go but down, but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie. hoffman is superb, as usual, and even hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself. hawke might have been a little out of his element, but he played the part well enough. add into this mix andy's wife, played perfectly by marisa tomei, cheating with hank; andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery. this movie will get you thinking.
