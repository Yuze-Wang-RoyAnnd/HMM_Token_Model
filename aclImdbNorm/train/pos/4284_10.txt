this movie is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the balkans yet again, 45 years after the time depicted. all the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response. the accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the types, however, make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex-yugoslavia to its madness. in fact, no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie, and its twin, *maratonci trce pocasni krug.* did i mention it is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen?
