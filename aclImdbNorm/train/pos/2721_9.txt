the real story (took place in kansas in 1959) of a murder (perry and dick, two ex-convicts who broke into a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). richard brooks directed the chilling and disturbing capote's book about the reasons that drove these kids to the crime (are they natural born killers ?). the crime scenes are very brutal and haunting because of the lack of senses and reasons for what we witnessed. stunning black & white cinematography from conrand hall, excellent country - road music score from quincy jones, amazing performances in two principal roles from robert blake and scott wilson and first time in a movie a sad comment about capital punishment at the last moments before their deaths. jones, hall and brooks (as director and as writer for adapted screenplay) are academy award nominees. gripping, superbly directed and frightening, one of the best films of this decade
