this movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) it contained great backdrops and sets. 2) it showed the disparity of a war-torn environment alongside a technological one. 3) john cusack's acting was terrific. he portrayed angst very well. 4) it showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war-torn situation. 5) it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects. i was also impressed with the acting for the most part. hilary's acting was, i found, the most stilted. the morals and values of everyone in a war-torn situation are up for grabs. the liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. great stuff. psp
