robin williams and kurt russell play guys in their 30's who put their marraiges in jeopardy by deciding (russell somewhat reluctantly) to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival bakersfield years after the fact. williams is ok, but russell is flat-out great as legendary taft quarterback remo hightower. holly palance does a nice and attractive turn as williams' wife, who could live without this rematch. film is worth watching just to see the famed remo in action. highly recommended.
