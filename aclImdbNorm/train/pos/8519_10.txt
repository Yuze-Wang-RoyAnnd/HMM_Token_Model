astounding.....this may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie, but i sure enjoyed it.<br /><br />that last man who commented is a fool, this movie was one of a kind, and the music dark, jerry goldsmith himself, would had applaud this movie.<br /><br />great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this film.<br /><br />i collect horror movies and soundtracks, so listen to what i have to say, not that other idiot.<br /><br />there is only one thing that do not fascinate me, the endings.<br /><br />according to prophecy it is all inaccurate, including final conflict, and left behind.<br /><br />but my conclusion being.... there great movies...and should be seen, before the great depression falls upon us, and before the democrats take over the presidency too.<br /><br />so signed....jacob eder...a farmer, with a mastermind.
