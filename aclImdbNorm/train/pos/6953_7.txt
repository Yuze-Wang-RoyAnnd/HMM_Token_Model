this is one of those movies that make better trailers than full-length feature films. the concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the "punch" into this movie. so many lines and gags were left hanging too long, with no definite ending and really didn't leave me laughing. wilson, wilson, farris & thurman were great. wanda sykes was under-used in this film and needed more exposure, and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, more of a dvd rental. also, i was looking for some sort of a feel-good music video during the end credits, something that has become sort of a trade-mark to these romantic comedy films, a la something about mary, meet the parents but again, i was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this could have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines. it felt like it was rushed into theaters.
