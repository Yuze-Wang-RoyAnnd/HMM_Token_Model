8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter had an auspicious start. the supremely-talented tom shadyac was involved in the project. this meant that the comedy would be nothing less of spectacular, and that's exactly what happened: the show remains one of the freshest, funniest, wittiest shows made in a very long time. every line, facial expression, casting choice, scene, all wreaked of perfection. there was not one episode after which i thought, "man that wasn't as good as the rest". each one was a standout. again, this is the kind of perfectionism that we've come to expect from tom. for those who don't know, tom shadyac is the director of ace ventura (first movie), the nutty professor (first one) and liar liar. quite a r'esum'e. he's a producer here not a director, but his magic touch is felt in every episode.the family consists of:<br /><br />the father: paul hennessy (john ritter): nice, slightly neurotic, can be a pushover from time to time, works as a sports writer. john unfortunately passed away in 2003 leaving a fond memory and near-sure cancellation contemplations by the suits.<br /><br />the mother: cate (katey sagal): come on, who didn't fall in love with katey when she played peg on married with children? al bundy was our hero. we viewers gave him the respect and love he never had. but without peg's nonchalant, parasitic, lazy lifestyle, al would've probably been just another chicago dad instead of the mess that peg (life, actually) caused him to be. katey was a milf back then and still is: a brune now (instead of a redhead) and just as buxom as ever. cate is the conservative mom and loving wife. i know it sounds boring, but comedically, she fits perfectly. <br /><br />the ditzy blonde daughter: bridget (played to perfection by kaley cuoco): almost never has an idiot been played so well. aside of gob on arrested development, bridget may well be a shoe-in for any awards given to this archetype. bridget is shallow, self-centered, not very bright and a tad slutty in his look. she plays the dumb blonde role better than absolutely anyone imo. perfection. one of the high-points of the show.<br /><br />the overlooked geeky daughter: kerry (amy davidson): a brune and a geek, she gets no love from life or circumstances. feels overlooked, under-appreciated and neglected most of the time. she's bridget's younger sister (in reality she's older than her) and the two's extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes, to much of our amusement.<br /><br />the son: rory (martin spanjers): was the second funniest character imo before the passing of ritter, then john passes, new characters come and rory is not the wise-cracking verbal-trouble-maker that he used to: that went mostly to david spade's character. <br /><br />those characters were the main ones at the time of john ritter. unfortunately enough, the insanely hilarious larry miller (one of my favorites) did not get lots of screen time. he played paul's co-worker/competitor. after an aortic dissection cost ritter his life in 2003 (september 11th), the show was on hiatus for a while. no one thought it could come back, but it did later on, with a couple of new additions. this began the second phase of the show, and the new characters were:<br /><br />the strict, confident school principal: ed (adam arkin): i saw adam here and there on talk shows. this was the first time that i saw him do anything. impressed, is the word i use. his performance was very impressive. sad he wasn't brought in earlier. he also plays cate's potential love interest after paul passes. the gradual progress towards this point (which would've sounded crazy at the beginning) earns the creators lots of praise. it was done slowly, carefully and excellently, with constant respect paid to the paul (ritter).<br /><br />the attitude grandpa: jim egan (james garner): a surprisingly welcome addition to the series, he was cannon fodder for endless 'old' jokes, mainly by...<br /><br />the 35-year-old unemployed wise-cracking half-brother of the mom: cj (played to insanely funny heights by david spade): i knew spade was funny, i just didn't know he was this funny. somehow, spade's very familiar presence is sensed inside his character (as opposed to a separable character), which is understandable, since he's a comic and he's on a comedy show. this eerie feeling is kinda like seeing someone borrow lots of material from david spade's appearances in movies, talk shows and functions (award shows, etc.) and delivering a superb impersonation of spade's voice and comedy style, except, that it is spade. by that i mean you realize he's not trying to play someone else, or a whole new character: he's being the goofy, funny spade we've come to know, and he takes this pleasantly humorous formula to the absolute top. every line he uttered, every sarcasm he begot, all classics, literally. spade was crazy-funny; so, so funny.<br /><br />the show's humor and drama were both upped after the show was back, but audiences thought, "john passed, it ain't gonna be the same anymore". this is understandable, considering we are talking about a group of people (american viewers) who gave 'yes dear' a free ride but caused andy richter controls the universe to be cancelled in no time. as the show's quality increased, its ratings declined. soon it was no more, sadly. <br /><br />and i saved the best for last: fans of married with children are in for a treat. and boy, what a treat it was. i still shiver just remembering it. it's a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it, even if i legitimately do it under the "spoiler..." pretext. suffice it to say that it's something you'll never forget. i know i won't :-)
