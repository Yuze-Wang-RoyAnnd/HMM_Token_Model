if you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors, this is the film for you. seeing frank sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs. michele morgan, (millie pico) gave an outstanding performance with plenty of dance and musical numbers. leon errol, (cyrus drake) gave a great supporting role along with victor borge, (sir victor fitzroy victor) who performed classical piano and no slap stick comedy like he did in his career. this is not a great musical, but frank sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940's.
