warning: mild spoilers.<br /><br />the story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing - even moving - episode in american history and world religious history. this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith, whom mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of jesus christ on the earth. i've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing.<br /><br />joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (alvin, hyrum & joseph) who, at a very young age, needed an operation. the operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. the scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parents.<br /><br />joseph's religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what mormons call the first vision was interestingly portrayed. the face of jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands. the rejection by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is sweetened at least slightly by joseph's marriage to emma.<br /><br />this movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history, but merely jumps from scene to scene. this is not a critique - simply a note about the style.<br /><br />the practice of tarring and feathering is shown, and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a sermon about the savior's love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked.<br /><br />the movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of mormonism as an infant church, while at the same time the ever-deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments.<br /><br />the film shows many scenes from joseph's life, including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma. an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his endless love for children, his wit, his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition, his religious sentiments, and his compassion.<br /><br />as joseph and hyrum ride to carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters from throughout the movie, whose lives had been touched by joseph, are shown along the way, helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful.<br /><br />at the end, the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portrayed, and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed.<br /><br />when i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non-members. i no longer think that is the case, although i hope the movie can do just that. as an insider, i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him. i am curious to see how outsiders will view the film - whether they will simply see it as propagandic, an epic story of an american religious man, or something else.<br /><br />the film is beautifully shot, family friendly, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - we moderns take for granted.
