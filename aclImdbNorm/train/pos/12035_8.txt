i recently stumbled across this film on tnt five minutes into it, while on vacation in florida... (hey there has to be some down time in the hotel, right?) i was initially surprised to see melissa joan hart in any feature length film on tnt. i mean "drive me crazy" isn't that old already, is it?<br /><br />but i stuck with it, and was thoroughly surprised and entertained. melissa plays her role as the psychotic jennifer excellently. the supporting cast (nick, the ex-con boyfriend; karen, her best friend; and her life-controlling parents) all added a great degree of believability. the twist at the end was a nice closure to this tale of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everybody.<br /><br />if you get a chance, check it out!<br /><br />
