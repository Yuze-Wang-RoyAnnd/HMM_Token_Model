this is a film that was very well done. i had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release! cheers to the director and all the actors. the supporting cast gave eva mendez what she needed to take this to the top. as everyone else here states, the latter portion of the film is riveting. katie cassidy did an amazing job with her character, being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made. she has quite the career ahead of her. i was amazed at her performance. i completely enjoyed the film, questioned my values in life and priorities, and am a better person for it! a great message lies within the film. release it so all can enjoy!
