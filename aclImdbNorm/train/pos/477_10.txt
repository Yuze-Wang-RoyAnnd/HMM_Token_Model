hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6. i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film.<br /><br />in this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. he is famous for a game he played against steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz. instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament hall, never to return.<br /><br />the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life. a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer. although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways.<br /><br />in the film, a world championship match is depicted, as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin. the format is a knockout, which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself - going from 128 players to just 2 in the final. but this was a group knockout - which also depicts a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other.<br /><br />the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself. in fact, i have done a youtube video about it, for you to explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=xzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon
