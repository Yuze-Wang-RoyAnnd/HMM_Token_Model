overall, i enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers.<br /><br />however, i really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and nichols' closer. one scene especially where adrian grenier's character is questioning rosario dawson's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in closer where clive owen's character is questioning julia roberts, although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in "love." also note that "anna" is the name of both dawson's and roberts' character. can't be coincidence. now closer is based on patrick marber's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on arthur schnitzler's "reigen" so i'm not sure how this connection formed.<br /><br />anyone have an idea?
