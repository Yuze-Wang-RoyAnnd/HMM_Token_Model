origins of the care bears & their cousins. if you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. the cousins are raised with the care bears, rather than meeting them later. however i have no problems with that, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. the babies are adorable and it's fun watching them play and grow. my favourite is swift heart rabbit. the villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. i could empathise with the three children since i was never good at sports either. cree summer is excellent as christy. the songs are sweet and memorable. if you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoyed the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10
