mitchell leisen's fifth feature as director, and he shows his versatility by directing a musical, after his previous movies were heavy dramas. he also plays a cameo as the conductor.<br /><br />you can tell it is a pre code movie, and nothing like it was made in the us for quite a while afterwards (like 30+ years). leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see - no widescreen shots or from above ala busby berkeley. what i do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience.<br /><br />as others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless, and jack oakie and victor mclaghlan play their normal movie personas. gertrude michael however provides a bit of spark.<br /><br />the musical numbers are interesting and some good (the rape of the rhapsody in particular is amusing) but the drama unconvincing and faked - three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. this is where this movie could have been a lot better.
