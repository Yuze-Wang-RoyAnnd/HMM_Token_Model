eddie izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius, and this is eddie at his very best. his material is extremely witty and hilarious, and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage. instead of insulting the audience's intelligence, he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences, hitler, the moon landing, and the british. with so many memorable laughs, one can't help but repeat some of his lines. forever more, "do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine. every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see "dress to kill". by far the best british standup comedian i've ever witnessed, eddie izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage. however, his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is. "dress to kill" is a treasure, one that luckily has found its way to home video, and can and should be enjoyed again and again.
