... and if you're very, very good it will resemble moon over parador.<br /><br />this film had a slightly silly story, but it was a fantasy after all, and the casting and the acting was spot-on! dreyfuss was perfect as the actor/impostor, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have. you get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes.<br /><br />this was one of dreyfuss's best roles, just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator! and the parting scene: like something out of casablanca, indeed! <br /><br />raul julia was superb as the paradorian chief of secret police. he gets some really funny lines, some of which are homages to other films, like "round up the usual suspects!" <br /><br />and sonia braga was excellent as the girl friend -- in addition to being a really hot number: "you should get an oscar for tonight!" <br /><br />let us not forget johnny winters as the cia agent and the several guest stars playing themselves: sammy davis jr., ike pappas, dick cavett -- all perfectly done.<br /><br />all in all, a memorable romp under the paradorian moon.<br /><br />-r.
