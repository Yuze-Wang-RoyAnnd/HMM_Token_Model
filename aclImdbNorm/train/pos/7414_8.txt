this was a very enjoyable film. a humorous, but poignant look at family, and the obligations that come with it. the story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his fathers bath house in a small chinese village. there he learns to appreciate, even cherish the very things he left home to get away from. the film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful.
