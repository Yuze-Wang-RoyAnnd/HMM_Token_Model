i saw this important intense film tonight. its richard gere and claire's dane's most important and best work. gere deserves an oscar for his fine portrayal of a man being forced into early retirement as a sex offender registrar administrator. claire danes is riveting as the woman gere handpicks to replace him - a woman he tries to teach all he can while investigating one final case in which gere's character is convinced one of those he is charged to monitor may be holding a young girl hostage. the subject matter is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this film will not soon be forgotten. i know i will be haunted by gere's portrayal for a very long time. not since anthony hopkins portrayal of a serial killer has a screen portrayal terrified and so engaged me. the film opens with a shocking statistic so don't miss the opening credits. intense and memorable. richard gere's finest role proving the man can act. danes can as well and both do extraordinarily well in this often challenging film.<br /><br />this is a gutsy film and gere gives a multi-layered deeply felt performance. just give him the oscar now...he deserves it!
