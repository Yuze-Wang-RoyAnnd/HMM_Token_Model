every kid has that movie that he pops into vhs when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter around. this was that movie for me.<br /><br /> i can tell you the whole plot exactly, i must have seen it 100 times at least, and i can say it is a good kids/family movie.<br /><br />i still have the tape, i haven't watched it in 5 years, but maybe i'll get around to it this week, and be a kid for the day.<br /><br /> you just have to love the care bears, and their messege.<br /><br />
