this was a good movie. it wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different. this movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war. this film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made. colin farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and clifton collins jr and also matthew davis contributed reasonably well. seeing colin farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years, you would never thought it would happen. i will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch. its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future.
