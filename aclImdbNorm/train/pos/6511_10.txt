like many here i grew up with scooby-doo. unlike many here who did, i love this show! i think that it has been very well done and thought through. everything about it marks it as a spin-off which isn't meant to be taken seriously. the formula is simple - it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy. by using the well known shaggy and scooby-doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode.<br /><br />there have always been scooby-doo spin-offs which have annoyed fans. the classic being the scooby-shaggy-scrappy shorts from the 80's. these spin-offs had their place: they allowed new content to be sold, created new fans, and kept scooby-doo merchandise on the shelves. i would agree that "shaggy & scooby-doo: get a clue!" doesn't fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what i had always wanted the scooby-shaggy-scrappy shorts to be: an action packed show which focuses on the best/funniest scooby-doo characters! good features of the show: the animation, the voices, the attention to detail, the bad-guys, the "best friend" relationship between shaggy and scooby-doo, the constant humour! bad features: none, although the revamped mystery machine is pretty close at times.<br /><br />well done warner bros. animation! one of the cleverest cartoons in a long time!
