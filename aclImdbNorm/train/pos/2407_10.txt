the first time i saw this film, i loved it. it was different.<br /><br />i am a christian (bible believing). i don't go along with the crowd of right wing believers. i dropped out of that atmosphere.<br /><br />to me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what judas tried to do. i call it the judas syndrome.<br /><br />judas didn't get it, even though jesus said his kingdom was not of this world.<br /><br />this film certainly showed some of that.<br /><br />i also liked that jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples.<br /><br />also he was a very gorgeous jesus.<br /><br />it's a watch-over and over movie.<br /><br />very satisfying.
