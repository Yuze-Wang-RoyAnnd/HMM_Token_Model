it helps if you understand czech and can see this in the original language and understand the czechs obsession with 'the professionals', but if not, 'jedna ruka netlaska' is yet another great czech film. it is funny, dark and extremely enjoyable. the highest compliment i can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing.<br /><br />for a small country the czech republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature, from hrabal, hasek and kundera to the films of menzel, sverak and numerous others. czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it. this film is just that, it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings, but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise, good intent and optimism.<br /><br />i highly recommend this and most other projects trojan and machacek are involved in. enjoy it, it's a film made for just that reason - anyway, it's as close as the czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending...
