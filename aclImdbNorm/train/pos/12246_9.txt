the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice! so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice. the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much. the language is a delight to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word? samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice. i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days!! so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television. i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior. an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd!!!
