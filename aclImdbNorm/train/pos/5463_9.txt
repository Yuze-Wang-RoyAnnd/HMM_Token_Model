very slick, very pre-hays code, and still very sassy. i would highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you are not a fan of stynwyck. she's funny, she's sexy, she's hard-working - and love that perm she gets!<br /><br />barbara stynwyck is fantastic as a doozie of a floozy who rises up in the world, perfectly portrayed by a bank building. john wayne (in a suit!) plays one of her first conquests. <br /><br />the last three minutes are a letdown, but the sets, the lines, the clothes all add to one heck of a movie about rising vertically in the horizontal position.
