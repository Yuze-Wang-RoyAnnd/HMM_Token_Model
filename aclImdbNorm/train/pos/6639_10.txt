you're using the imdb.<br /><br />you've given some hefty votes to some of your favourite films.<br /><br />it's something you enjoy doing.<br /><br />and it's all because of this. fifty seconds. one world ends, another begins.<br /><br />how can it not be given a ten? i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight... exactly how could the first film ever made be better? for the record, the long, still opening shot is great showmanship, a superb innovation, perfectly suited to the situation. and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch. all this within fifty seconds.<br /><br />the word genius is often overused.<br /><br />this is genius.
