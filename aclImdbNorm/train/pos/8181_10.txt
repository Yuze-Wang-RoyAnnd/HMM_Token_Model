doctor feinstone is a dentist.he has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool.suddenly he discovers that his wife is making out with the pool attendant-he realises that behind everything clean,there is decay.he starts to torture his patients...corbin bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist-he is completely believable.there is surprisingly little gore but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque.highly recommended."the dentist 2" is also worth checking out!
