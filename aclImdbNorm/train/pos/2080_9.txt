the quote i used for my summary occurs about halfway through the good earth, as a captain of a chinese revolutionary army (played by philip ahn) apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot more of the looters among them, as his unit has just been called back to the front lines. of course, the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film, the former kitchen slave girl o-lan (for whose portrayal luise rainer, now 99-years-old, won her second consecutive best actress oscar).<br /><br />the next scene finds o-lan dutifully delivering her bag of looted jewels to her under-appreciative husband, farmer wang lung (paul muni), setting in motion that classic dichotomy of a man's upward financial mobility being the direct inverse of his moral decline.<br /><br />for a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery, false accusations, misogyny, starvation, home invasion, eating family pets, mental retardation, infanticide, exploited refugees, riots, civil war, summary mass street executions, bigamy, child-beating, adultery, incest, and insect plagues of biblical proportions, the good earth is a surprisingly heart-warming movie.<br /><br />my parting thought is in the form of another classic quote, from o-lan herself (while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband wang lung had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut): "meat is meat."
