having read the reviews for this film, i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good. however, this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time. the majority of reviews that i had read, said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow. and whilst some parts do leave you confused, the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much. it's not like "lock, stock..." or "snatch", in the sense that it isn't that funny (in fact, it's pretty dark), and it is a lot more intelligent, in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints (and, in one of the best scenes of the film, jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself). the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned, is that it is full of memorable characters, specifically statham, who gives a fantastic performance as the lead, and ray liotta, who spends most of the film in speedos, but gives a great performance none the less. if you've got time, and have time afterwards to think about the film, and even watch it again, you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film. i think it's fantastic, and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game.
