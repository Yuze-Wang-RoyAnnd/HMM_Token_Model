i rented this movie on dvd without knowing what to expect - and as i am about to study film-making in canada of all places, i most certainly will bring this up in class.<br /><br />the story, centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself, is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on time.<br /><br />if you simply couldn't laugh during "hollywood north" i suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away - you might have serious issues.<br /><br />besides the wonderful script i also noticed the great chemistry between actors deborah kara unger and matthew modine - where they really just acting? jennifer tilly (playing a hilariously bad actress) and martin landau, also delivered a very edgy, yet funny performance.<br /><br />great film, even better cast.
