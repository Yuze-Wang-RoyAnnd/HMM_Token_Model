i've been trying to find out about this series for ages! thank you, imdb! i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind. as a 6-year old, of course, i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops, which was absolutely chilling (i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine, which i still have) what i also remember, though, was the atmosphere, which was unusual right from the beginning - mysterious, austere, and extremely authentic. when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation. it's a very hard thing to capture - and probably impossible in hollywood. every 'odyssey' i've seen since has been an enormous let-down. the characters in this series seemed genuine, real people - ancient greek people - and not some hollywood stars in costumes. this is a real masterpiece! but - why is it not better known? and why isn't it available on vhs or dvd? i would just love to have the chance to see this again!
