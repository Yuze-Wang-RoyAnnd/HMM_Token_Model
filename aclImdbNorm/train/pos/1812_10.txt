this is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever. i had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years. until i saw an add on tv for adgth and it brought back fond memories of me watching it when i was a little kid. and when i watched it a few nights ago i became addicted to the movie. usually i don't like animated family movies but this one is special it is the perfect family movie.<br /><br />the ending of the movie always touches my heart and saddens me very much but that is what makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that is coming out for kid movies today. i mean the movie is g rated and it is about 2 dogs who are involved with gambling, there is a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell depicted in the movie. which i believe makes the movie from good to great. i mean movies today don't bring reality to kids and in this movie they did.<br /><br />rip judith barsi & dom deluise
