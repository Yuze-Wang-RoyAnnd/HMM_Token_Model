i saw "an american in paris" on its first release when i was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway. i went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times i have seen it since, both in the cinema and on tv. it makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (george gershwin) and features the greatest male (gene kelly) and female (leslie caron) dancers in hollywood history. the supporting cast of oscar levant (as quirky as ever), georges guetary (why didn't he make more movies ?) and nina foch (brilliant in an unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. the closing ballet, superbly choreographed to the title music, makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. all the gershwin songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are "it's very clear" (caron and kelly on the banks of the seine) and "i got rhythm" (the kids of paris joining gene kelly in "une chanson americaine"). if you love paris, see this movie. if you've never been to paris in your life, see it. but see it !
