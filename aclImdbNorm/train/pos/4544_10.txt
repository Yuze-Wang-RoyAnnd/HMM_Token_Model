okay, i know i shouldn't like this movie but i do. from pat morita's loveable interpretation of a japanese stereotype to jay leno's annoying yell, i laughed throughout this movie.as long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, it's a good mvie.<br /><br />my favorite part is morita talking to his boss in tokyo with the drinking a close second.
