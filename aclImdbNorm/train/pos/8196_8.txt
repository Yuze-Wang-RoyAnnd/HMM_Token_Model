i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie. its got a pretty good plot, some good action, and the change of location for harry does not hurt either. sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that. eastwood is in good form as dirty harry, and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop. if you liked dirty harry, then you should see this one, its a lot better than the dead pool. 4/5
