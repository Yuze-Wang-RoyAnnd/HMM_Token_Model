i liked it... just that... i liked it, not like the animated series... i love it!!!. the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate, but this cartoon was awesome, but it really didn't like it that much. there's too much people talking about bruce being so cold, but if this is around 5 years later, anybody in a crime-fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude, so to me it isn't a flaw. batgirl was awesome she really fit there, as there isn't more dick grayson as a robin, batman needed a good teammate, not like the new robin, he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child. but heres what didn't work: the new artwork... it isn't horrible but... to me it does'nt work in a series like batman. this is a dark character, with a maniac killer like the joker, so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon, the joker isn't a bad design but i still like the past joker (but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond:return of the joker) , so this joker isn't near as good. the good thing about the joker is that it still mark hamil voice. my favorite character: harley quinn (im in love for her) they put an awesome episode for her: mad love (to me the best episode of this series). here we finally know how she turned harley quinn, and how the joker twisted her mind, and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series, darker, no happy ending, brutal fight with the joker (but too short), this is how it was to be all the series. but in general i didn't like how she made harley in this series... in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way, she get punched, she say nonsenses, she make flaws... c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her, not from her... and here they put ridiculous (like i said the only episode where i don't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper) so in general its a good series, it has it upsides and downs, the drawn could be better ( my good!!! kill that catwoman!!!!) nice sound effects, nice music, nice voices and nice episodes: my favorites, mad love, jokers millions, old wounds, sins of the father, and cold comfort. if you enjoyed batman:tas you can watch this but don't spec too much, in the other hand if you didn't watched tas, watch this first and then watch tas in that way you're really gonna love tas :d
