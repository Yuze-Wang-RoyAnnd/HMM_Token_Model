picking up right after the moscow-showdown of supremacy, this is bourne's greatest adventure and his final climax. throughout the tight, 115-min-runtime the movie takes bourne from russia to madrid, paris, marocco and ultimately new york. damon is every inch of the hard-trained killer robert ludlum imagined, he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now, and it's the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable, and it's exactly the fine way damon manages to combine these two polar-opposites of himself that's so breathtaking. in this third, bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it, ultimatum delivers such an high-octane performance that you'll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull-offs; just look out for two great car-chases and a fight-scene as realistic as bond vs. shaw back in '63. director greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get; a true pay-off to bourne fans and a new breed of spy-thriller standard.
