this isn't 'bonnie and clyde' or 'thelma and louise' but it is a fine road movie. it sets up its two main characters gently and easily. viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly, which is a tribute to the director. there is the young french (and english) speaking son who wants to do well in france, has a french girlfriend and who drinks alcohol, parties as young men do. and there is his moroccan arabic (and french) speaking father who devoutly follows his muslim faith, with generosity and the wisdom of elders and who rejects the new culture surrounding him (like mobile phones). the film could explore very powerful politics - the odd couple drive thru the former yugoslavia, thru turkey and then thru the middle east to get to mecca. these are areas where the muslim populations have been involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to hold power and where religious communities are in constant deadly battle with each other. yet the film moves thru those places and possibilities with only hints of such agendas. the relationship between the two is key to this film, and faith, politics are the backdrop. it seems to be saying that we are all human, and need to understand and care for each other in order to manage well in this world. it certainly isn't 'natural born killers' and is all the better for it.
