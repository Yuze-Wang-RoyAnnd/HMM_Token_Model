at first glance i expected this film to be crappy because i thought the plot would be so excessively feminist. but i was wrong. as you maybe have read in earlier published comments, i agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother. i never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman. it's like guzman is presented as somebody with a spine, this in contrast to her classmates. so i was surprised by the story, in fact, i thought it was quite good, except for the predictable end. maybe it would've been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist, so that the viewer is somewhat more surprised.<br /><br />in addition, i'd like to say that rodriguez earned her respect by the way she put away her character. i can't really explain why, but especially in the love scenes she convinced me. it just looked real i think.<br /><br />i gave it a 7 out of 10, merely because of the dull last half hour.
