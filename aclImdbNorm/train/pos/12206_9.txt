of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, this has to rank as one of the strangest, and most fun to watch. i say that because of the four main actors: orson welles, rita hayworth, everett sloane and glenn anders. <br /><br />the first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me, especially anders. his character, "george grisby," is one of the strangest people i've ever seen on film. his voice, and some of the things he said, have to be heard to be believed. slaone isn't far behind in the "strange" category. hayworth is not as glamorous with short, blonde hair but still is hayworth, which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy. welles' is as fascinating as always. one tip: if you have the dvd, turn on the english subtitles. his character in this movie is an irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /><br />welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups. you also have a unique ending, visually, with a shootout in a house of mirrors. great stuff! as bizarre as this film is, i still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. other than that, no complaints. <br /><br />this is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.
