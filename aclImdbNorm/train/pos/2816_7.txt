this is an above average jackie chan flick, due to the fantastic finale and great humor, however other then that it's nothing special. all the characters are pretty cool, and the film is entertaining throughout, plus jackie chan is simply amazing in this!. jackie and wai-man chan had fantastic chemistry together, and are both very funny!, and i thought the main opponent looked really menacing!, however the dubbing was simply terrible!. the character development is above average for this sort of thing!, and the main fight is simply fantastic!, plus some of the bumps jackie takes in this one are harsh!. there is a lot of really silly and goofy humor in this, but it amused me, and the ending is hilarious!, plus all the characters are quite likable. it's pretty cheap looking but generally very well made, and while it does not have the amount of fighting you would expect from a jackie chan flick, it does enough to keep you watching, plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when jackie (dragon) and wai-man chan(tiger), are playing around with a rifle and it goes off!. this is an above average jackie chan flick, due to the fantastic finale, and great humor, however other then that it's nothing great, still it's well worth the watch!. the direction is good. jackie chan does a good job here with solid camera work, fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part. the acting is very good!. jackie chan is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious, as usual does some crazy stunts, had fantastic chemistry with wai-man chan, kicked that ass, and played this wonderful cocky character, he was amazing!, i just wished they would stop dubbing him!. (jackie rules!!!!!). wai-man chan is funny as jackie's best friend, i really liked him, he is also a very good martial artist. rest of the cast do ok i guess. overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5
