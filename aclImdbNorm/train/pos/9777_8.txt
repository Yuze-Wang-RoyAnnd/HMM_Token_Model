one of the best low budget movies from germany! is this is the dark side of new age? if you believe in esoteric, please don't watch this movie! it blows all your positive fantasies away. this movie shows that beyond the peaceful facade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror. i hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon! andreas marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area, making movies with a few euros! i'm waiting for the second hit!
