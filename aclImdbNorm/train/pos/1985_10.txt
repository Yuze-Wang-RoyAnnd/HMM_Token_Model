im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be oliver.this film is so well made,the characters are well depicted,the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great,my favourite being 'reviewing the situation'sung by ron moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of fagin.i wasn't old enough to see oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own.its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been.i don't think charles dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote oliver to depict the poverty in london,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this very well.also another great reason to watch this film is bullseye the old type english bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an english bull terrier would have looked in victorian times.notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,bill sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.a victorian bull terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.his a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys bill sykes after he has killed nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head bill sykes thought he was.this is a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way,there's something for everyone in this film.
