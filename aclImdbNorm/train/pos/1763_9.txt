this is one of the funnier films i've seen. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm. it's altmanesque screenplay, brilliant physical humour, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carell's nipple..i truly was. surprisingly, this is a good-natured, unabashed comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way. catherine keener was terrific as trish, and all of steve carell's friends were flawed but amiable, and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended.
