this movie's origins are a mystery to me, as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it. i assume that before "starship troopers", "killshot" was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network, cable, or otherwise. the new title of "kill shot" is comically thrown into the opening sequence, the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema. the quick cuts, cheesy "melrose place" music, and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for.<br /><br />and i don't mind at all. i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion, not so hot a movie - but that's another review). after looking it up on imdb, my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career (see bond-girl and wild things references here). they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r-rated status - coveted in suspense video rental sections, that is. in any event, they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section.<br /><br />all in all, it's entertaining. i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a tv pilot, though. that was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show, the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual.<br /><br />would i rent it again? no. would i watch this tv show? well, why not - it's better than baywatch. and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s. token black guy (who's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter-racial dating), token asian (japanese, i assume from the name koji) more adept at science and computers than talking to women, beautiful, intelligent latina pre-med student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account - this show probably would have done ok.<br /><br />but as a movie it just cracks me.<br /><br />i gave it a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was forced to become. it made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all i ask of rentals.
