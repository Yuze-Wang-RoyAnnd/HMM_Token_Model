beyond the excellent direction,production,acting & the predictable drama lies an essential message in the script:<br /><br />"listening leads all the way" in order for the voice to flourish,listen.to harmonise with other in voice,listen. in order to approach yourself,listen.to discover the needs of any situation or others,listen. it appears that the script writers are conveying a "life's secret".listening leads to an awareness of one's self. it awakens the other senses, especially vision & expands the horizon.one's soul too can be discovered. the artistry of this movie "as it is in heaven" magnificently displayed the unfolding of life,not only its joy & sadness,but ultimately the hope of life. all this by the leading character's first instruction to the choir;<br /><br />"just listen,it leads all the way"
