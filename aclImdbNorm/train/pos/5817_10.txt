if you want to remember mj, this is a good place to start. this movie features sweet tunes, mj as robot, and a crazy, messed-up plot. i recall, many a night, passing out to this fine feature film in college, and pondering the sheer awesomenes of whoever decided to green light this ridiculous piece of .<br /><br />there is lots of singing. lots of dancing. there is lots of singing while dancing. mj slays it as you would expect when it comes to this stuff. but there is much more to this movie. there is claymation. there are fat children (clay). there is an anthropomorphic rabbit that michael jackson has to battle in a dance off (obviously clay too). there is joe pesci as well (not made of clay).<br /><br />rip- we love you michael! it is a sad day for all of us.
