first of all, i have to start this comment by saying i'm a huge nightmare on elm street fan. i think it's the greatest horror series ever. for me, freddy is the boogeyman! of course, freddy's dead, which tried to be the last chapter back then, is a weird movie. it doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films. freddy has a lot of screen time. some think it makes him less scary, which i do agree. and that's, in my opinion, exactly the point. this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better, who he is, who he were, how he became the man haunting our dreams. for some people, it's a bad thing, it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil. obviously those people won't like rob zombie's remake of halloween. to truly enjoy this one, you have to see things differently. it's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you. this was the first one, and it was awesome. as the years passed by, freddy killed more and more people, and nobody could ever get rid of him for good. now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of freddy's realm of terror. beside the story of freddy's past, i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie. no more kids in springwood, only crazy grown-ups. the nightmare scenes are all great. the soundtrack is awesome, especially the opening song called ''i'm awake now'' performed by goo goo dolls. in my opinion, the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i can't believe it's so underrated. maybe it is misunderstood, or i have different tastes! anyway, all freddy fans should watch it. it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too, and a lot of cameos! get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed.
