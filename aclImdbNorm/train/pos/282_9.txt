this is undeniably the scariest game i've ever played. it's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which i usually don't care much for), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround soundeffects ("scryeeee, scryeeee..") and above all incredible atmosphere. i love the scrye, which enables you, at certain places in the games, to see or hear events that happened there in the past. the only game i've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. i'm a great horror fan, escpecially of clive barker's stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story. 9/10 (-1 because i'm no fps fan, and perhaps the game was a bit short?)
