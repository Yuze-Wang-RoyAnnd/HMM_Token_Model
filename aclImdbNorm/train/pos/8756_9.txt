i caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it's entirety and i'm glad i did. i was immediately drawn by the storyline and cared about the girls involved. naive high school graduates, best friends since childhood, take a high school trip and are taken in by a con man named nick who get them into serious trouble. they are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring. taken in to custody the girls learn to cope with their incarceration while trying to find a way out of their trouble. everything that they try to help themselves falls short when the thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their american lawyer "yankee hank". hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by alice(claire dane). however, the thai native wife of hank smells a rat in the case and does some further foot work of investigation and finds out the girls really were victimized. the end of the movie when alice does a selfless act to save darlene (beckinsale) had me in tears. i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
