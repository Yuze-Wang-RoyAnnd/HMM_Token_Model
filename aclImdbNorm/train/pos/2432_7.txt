i remember casper comic books, but don't remember any cartoons. maybe they weren't memorable; i don't know but at my advanced age, here i am watching this very early casper animated short yesterday. afterward, i was shocked to read the user-comments here. did people miss the ending?<br /><br />i have to learn all over again that casper isn't like the other ghosts, who like to go out each night and scare the c--p out of everyone. "he sees no future in that," according to the narrator here. instead, one night he goes out to the rural section of town, inadvertently scares some animals and can't find any friends. it brings him to tears, until a little fox hears him bawling and befriends him. the two become buddies but soon, the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress.<br /><br />other reviews have all mentioned what happens, so i'll touch on that, too. the fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown) and casper is in tears for losing "the only friend i ever had." but, nobody mentions the happy ending to this story. "ferdie" the fox becomes a spirit-figure like casper, jumps on his lap, licks his face and the narrator comments "they lived happily ever after." both characters look overjoyed.<br /><br />what is so sad about that? this is a nice story with a nice, happy ending.
