wow, praise imdb and google, for i have been trying to remember the name of this f'ing awesome movie for over 15 years now. slaughter high, man! hells yeah!<br /><br />i'm not going to bore you with a plot summary, and actors, and yadda yadda yadda, 'cause you all know what's up. that's why you're here anyway. what i will do, however, is explain the fond memory i have of this quintessential 80's d-movie slasher joint.<br /><br />in 1987, when i was around the age of 7, my father used to rent all these horror movies. would he care that his kids were watching them with him? no. so, at that young age i saw slaughter high. what i saw in that movie stuck with me big time. i haven't seen it since, but i remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie. for example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) gets electrocuted. or, the guy being drowned in a cess pool. come on! my personal favorite, though...the exploding stomach from the tainted beer. amazing! how can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, like, 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it? then his stomach explodes? what!? and that great line: let's take my car...it always starts. classic crap all the way. <br /><br />i mean, i look back now, almost 20 years later, and laugh at it. but when i was 7, i was scared sh!tless. that jester hat (or was it a mask?) that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f*ck out!<br /><br />all in all, yes, a crappy movie. but for nostalgia purposes and for humor factor this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me. either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same late late late movie show, or hunt down a vhs copy and dust off your vcr.
