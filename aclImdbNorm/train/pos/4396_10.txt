i really enjoyed the detail that went into the script.<br /><br />jonathan rhys myers (misspelled) and jewel were outstanding in their support roles. as was jeffery wright. toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted, when he had to amputate his best friend's arm, knowing he would die without the procedure. <br /><br />attention to detail, with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly well.<br /><br />why this movie was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoters i can only imagine. i have strong suspicions. which makes it all the more appealing to me. i have given a dozen dvd copies out for presents.<br /><br />completely overlooked movie. rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours, then judge.
