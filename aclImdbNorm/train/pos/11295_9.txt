this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a los angeles television station's "late show". the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture, and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape, nor is it ever shown on television (apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart, the playwright/producer/director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii -- the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than 50 years after it was made). i did not see the movie again for over 30 years, when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a "bootlegged" copy on vhs (poor video quality, but good audio). my memory of it was correct: it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch. an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars, just starting out in their careers at the time 1944), went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well-known and fully-employed actors (e.g. judy holliday, edmond o'brien, jeanne crain, barry nelson, don taylor, karl malden, peter lind hayes, george "superman") reeves, red buttons, lee j. cobb, kevin mccarthy, and gary merrill). the scenes with the b-24 liberators are terrific, especially the close-up shots where the details of the giant (for those times) 4-engine bomber (then 18,000+ manufactured, now nearly extinct) can be seen. good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot-cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew (of course, very gender-biased as was the trend of the day: only the men became pilots, the women just supported them in their roles -- hardly acceptable in today's world). i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy.
