one of the joys of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray. boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd (especially the camera technique karloff, as janos rukh, uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite) and downright laughable, i didn't care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. the effects are done well for the time, the acting is great, and the finish is particularly strong. it reminds me of the pulp sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s, complete with ray guns and ridiculous science. you must watch this movie!
