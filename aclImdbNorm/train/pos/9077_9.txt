i really enjoyed the pilot, it was as amazing as i hoped it would be, if not better. patrick warburton was a riot, although at first i thought that i wouldn't be able to stand his character. him and megyn price had little chemistry at all, but hopefully as the season goes on they'll get more comfortable around each other. it must have been weird for megyn to go from being the star on her last show ["grounded for life"] to being a co-star. <br /><br />bianca kajlich and oliver hudson seem really new to the whole sitcom scene, but i think in time they'll get better. david spade's character, to my surprise, wasn't the whole focus of this pilot. the way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else i've ever seen on tv, but i think that it is just his style. it works for him.<br /><br />i think that couples, or even singles, will be able to relate to all the doubts and fights and being unsure about your decisions, that this show is about. all the situations that the characters are put in just feel like real life, not sugar-coated like most shows.<br /><br />i hope for all the actors sakes that cbs gives them a chance. this show has the potential to be one of the best series, if just given the chance and time.
