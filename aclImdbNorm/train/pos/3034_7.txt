an underrated addition to the graham greene cinematic canon - its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues. director shumlin, theatrical director, frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material, and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease. both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! in a 40s thriller!), the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous (and possibly paedophiliac), brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the spanish civil war into jolting dangerous reality, has one horrific murder, an astonishing insights into class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of greene's god, and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history.
