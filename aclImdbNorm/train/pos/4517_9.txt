with this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. you know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like marilyn monroe. not here -- adrian pasdar does a superb job of making gerald a real person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as gerald and geraldine. not only that, but as geraldine, he looks hot! and the chemistry between him and julie walters is electric. these are two characters who feel love for one another, and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is believable, and you find yourself cheering at the end! at least i did!
