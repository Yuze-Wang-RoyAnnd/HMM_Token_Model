this was the second entry in the regular columbo series, and it holds up well today. as i am able to look at it closely now on dvd and see how it is constructed, i am very impressed with the direction of bernard l. kowalski (who directed the fine macho callahan as well as countless tv episodes)--watch how the post-murder actions of the killer are shown on a split-screen effect on his two eyeglasses, watch how the murder itself is shown in montage fashion, watch the point-of-view shot from the perspective of the corpse. also, the wild but impressive avant-garde musical score from noted jazzman gil melle was incredible and helped so much to create atmosphere. and the supporting performance of brett halsey as the golf pro was wonderful--such subtlety and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times would be a one-dimensional cutout. the "formula" had not yet been set when this episode was filmed, so there are still some surprises in columbo's methods. of course, falk, robert culp, and ray milland are the highest-quality actors and it's a pleasure to see them work--all men are familiar from many other roles yet lose themselves in their characters here. in all, this entry in the columbo series--and many of the others--are as well-crafted as a very good feature film.
