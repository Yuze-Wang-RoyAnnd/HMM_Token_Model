thanks to kevin smith, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that return of the jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch. and oh no! muppets are involved! that makes it bad! everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it. now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it. this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it. this movie is good fun! it's just as awesome as i remember it being when i was six! enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smith's opinions! his aren't correct!<br /><br />and that ewok song at the end ruled! i bet you people don't even enjoy "ewoks: battle for endor"!!!! i'm going to set you all on fire!
