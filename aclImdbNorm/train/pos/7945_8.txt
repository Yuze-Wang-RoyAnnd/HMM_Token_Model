i am a fan of animal movies. if you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over. homeward bound did just this. they took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it. it was a complete success. it is very much an archetypal movie. you have the obi-wan of the group(shadow) who is wise and logical, you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting chance, and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised. these three personalities bounce off of each other very well. i also like how they made chance and sassy such dynamic characters, and they did not overdue it. most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film. what they are forgetting, however, is that it is supposed to be a kids film, and this still does not take away from the acual movie. this is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie. it is a disney movie without the cartoons, an air bud movie with a better plot. i would, without a doubt, advise you to watch it.
