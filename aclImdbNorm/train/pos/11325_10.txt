when i first heard about this series on animetv,i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen,this one tops it all off. i had to see this show,and that is what i really did. when i got the first volume of this show,it was the best. i really liked the animation,and all the fight scenes were awesome. i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were saber,and archer and of course i also like illya. and of course,all the episodes on the volumes were interesting,and very cool. another thing i have to say about the series is michael mcconnohie(famous for transformers,and others) playing the voice of berserker. he does have a cool character. and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume. so if you to see something good,then see this show,it's the best.
