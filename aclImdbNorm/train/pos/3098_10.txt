i loved this show so much and i'm so incredibly sad its canceled i thought it came back too, but just two stupid weeks. thats terrible. i hate how we never find out how everyone ends up. it sucks. bring it back! abc has stupid shows like supernanny and whatnot but doesn't give time to good ones like six degrees. if they're complaining about ratings it was probably because they had a bad slot because this was truly a good show, something i could relate to and anticipated. jj abrams delivered, he's awesome, i wish abc could just trust him enough to complete the story. i loved the entire cast too. i couldn't wait to see how everyone would someday meet each other at once. everyone's story is now left incomplete, now i'll never know if steven and whitney would get together or carlos and mae. i wanted to see what would happen to laura or damien and everyone else. this is really such a downer.
