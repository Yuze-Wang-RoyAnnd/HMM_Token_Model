the film is side spliting from the outset, eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together. the film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck, phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it. so hints are very welcome. if any one likes eddie murphy as a comedian and see's the video get it,it is worth the money and can't go far wrong.
