ok, i don't really think that trailer park boys has bad story lines, because they kick ass. they just... conflict with each other.<br /><br />for example: near the end of the movie, it shows ricky and julian telling "patrick lewis" to put the dog down and walk away. then at the end, it shows ricky and julian saying that they've been in jail for 2 years. in the tv series pilot, the first clip they show is the same clip of ricky and julian yelling at "patrick lewis". but in the tv series, they've supposedly only been in jail for 18 months.<br /><br />also, they give us the impression that the movie's story line and the tv series' story line are connected (because of the yelling scene between the guys). but some actors portray totally different characters. of course, patrick roach plays "patrick lewis" in the movie, but in the series he plays randy. sam tarasco plays one of the guys who pays ricky for an extermination, and then he plays sam losco in the series.<br /><br />also (again... i know, i have a lot to say), in the movie, the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash. the thing is, they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway, other than the yelling scene.<br /><br />sorry to keep on blabbing.
