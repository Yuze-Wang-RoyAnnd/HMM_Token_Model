i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen! i was bored and looked through the t.v. and found "home room" and it was already in about 5 min., but i got hooked. it was so interesting and moving. it shows what can happen in anyone's life. i give it a 10, more if possible. the director/ writer and actors did an amazing job. i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it. it was great, drama, mystery, and more. i cried for hours! i think that the director/ writer should write more movies like this one. i loved it! i didn't even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good. i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see.
