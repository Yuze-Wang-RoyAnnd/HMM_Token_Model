before tuscan sky, i saw diane lane's tender performance in this otherwise lark of a movie. campers are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults. each of those that return seem to be looking for something they lost, which makes it so realistic. maybe you had to be a camper to really get it, but in the words of one character noticing all her clothes were wet "this is so camp!" from the practical jokes and fighting over boyfriends, to the scary lunch lady and the early morning bell ... it's amp. once exciting activities now seem mundane. a terrific ensemble cast makes the best of one-two dimensional roles and makes them believable. bill paxton, diane, elizabeth, mrs. brad paisley (probably when he first fell for her!!) the beautiful scenery, bright colors, comical music (including variations of hello muddah)and a comic acting turn by noted director sam raimi makes this a movie you can pull out again and again like looking up an old friend.
