fay grim is a true example of what i call a completed puzzle film. it has all the pieces of acting, direction, storyline, and entertainment value. they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece, fay grim.<br /><br />this film follows a single mother fay grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing. soon the cia contacts fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband henry's. these journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the cia and his involvement with countries and their government doings. fay is sent to find these journals, in return to release her brother from prison, and is sent on a cat-and-mouse chase all over europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about.<br /><br />parker posey had already been an actress i liked after i watched her in the oh in ohio and best in show. she brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers, but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movies. posey made me believe what was happening on screen, i felt for her, i rooted for her, and i wanted to know more. she grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you can't stop thinking about what is happening to her.<br /><br />i haven't seen any other previous works by writer/director hal hartley but i believe i will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as fay grim was.<br /><br />if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd i'd highly urge you to choose fay grim. if you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely.
