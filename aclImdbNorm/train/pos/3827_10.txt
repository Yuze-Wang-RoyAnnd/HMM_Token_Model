i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about- this was a wonderful movie, and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel. the characters are truly young, mary is a strong match for byron, claire is juvenile and a tad annoying, polidori is a convincing beaten-down sycophant... all are beautiful, curious, and decadent... not the frightening wrecks they are in gothic.<br /><br />gothic works as an independent piece of shock film, and i loved it for different reasons, but this works like a merchant and ivory film, and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like. romantic, yes, but completely rekindles my interest in the lives of shelley and byron every time i think about the film. one of my all-time favorites.
