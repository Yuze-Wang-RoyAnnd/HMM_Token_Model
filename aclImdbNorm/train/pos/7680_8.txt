"holly" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. at its heart is it is a character-driven film, which wouldn't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of patrick (ron livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and holly (thuy nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young vietnamese girl. from the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing, everything is forthright and well-done. the contemporary classical score may put some off at first, but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout. this film, which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for holly and the many who share her plight. kudos to those who managed to get it made.
