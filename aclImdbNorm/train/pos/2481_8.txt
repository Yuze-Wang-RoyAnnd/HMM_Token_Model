i admit i've only seen about three of shakespeare's plays (romeo & juliet, macbeth, & of course hamlet) one i liked, the other i found so-so (macbeth), and hamlet i just found a masterpiece. i'm pleased to tell you that this adaptation is every bit as good as the intense and dramatic play. the acting is extremely strong (with a cast that features kenneth branagh, robin williams, and billy crystal how can you lose?) and the change in time period (looks like somewhere between the 17 and 1800's) plays off beautifully as the characters move about and say their infamous lines straight from the script itself that any fan of the shakespearean play will get chills from. if you're into this popular drama i highly urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation from shakespearean admirer kenneth branagh.
