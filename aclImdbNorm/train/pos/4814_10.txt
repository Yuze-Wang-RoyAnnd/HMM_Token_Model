i saw this on the big screen and was encapsulated with it. the period of queen victoria's younger years are a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was thrusted into one of the highest roles in the world.<br /><br />the script is perfect, the acting is amazing, the history and attention to detail is out of this world. emily blunt is perfect as victoria. funny how her mother is played by elizabeth the 1st and william iv is played by prince albert! (think blackadder).<br /><br />this portrayal of victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman once - i'm sure she would have been on jeremey kyle show if it had been around then: "my mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life".<br /><br />a perfect piece of a major part of british and commonwealth history.
