series 2 has got off to a great start! i don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them. and this show makes you think like that! these 4 30-something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic. so the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too. its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices!
