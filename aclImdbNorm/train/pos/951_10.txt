i know many people have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dickens' story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat. my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs, and we watch it together every christmas eve. i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too, because it's a very creepy ghost story.<br /><br />scott--typecast as scrooge--is shudderingly mean and nasty, making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving. i think it's up there with his performance in patton. the spirits are all effective, each one creepier than the last. watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year. and what a supporting cast! david warner, in particular, is in top form as bob cratchit, as is susannah york as his wife. <br /><br />i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others--but i may be mistaken, as it's been several years since i read it. regardless, this is a terrific christmas classic.
