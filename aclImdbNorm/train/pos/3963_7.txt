the history of the fbi, as told from the point of view of agent stewart via flashbacks, interwoven with his personal life story. stewart and miles (as his wife) are pretty good, as is hamilton as an earnest agent. the problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. it's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who's who cast of gangsters. some of the episodes are too long, some too short, and some just look out of place (stewart's daughter's school sequence). overall, it goes on way too long. nevertheless, it's worth a look for its handsome production values.
