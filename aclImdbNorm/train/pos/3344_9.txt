i went to see fever pitch with my mom, and i can say that we both loved it. it wasn't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other, and blah blah blah... you weren't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together. it was more real, because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie be about them getting together. people could actually relate to the film, because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances, or impossible situations. it was really funny, and i think it was jimmy fallon's best performance. all in all... i would definitely recommend it!
