recently when i was shopping, i saw the box-set of americian gothic, and i thought 'i remember that!' i used to set my alarm to get back up & watch this when it was on ch 4 in 1996 at 1.30am (i was 14). i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird, no person could ever be as frightening as lucas buck (with a b!!) no one ever was anyway. <br /><br />what annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box-set as when on tv. episodes in funny order, i kept thinking when does dr matt leave??? - they made it so confusing. <br /><br />however this is not the writers, producers or directors fault (its tv people in background the money makers they still do the same - just look at shows like carnivale and farscape they don't like originality in studios!!!!!)<br /><br />to finish - if you've not seen this and you call yourself a sci-fi fantasy, horror, supernatural drama..fan = you must. they even said the same in sfx when reviewing the box-set.
