the extraordinary rosemary forsyth is the main reason to see this flick. why she never became a bigger store may never be known. but she is exceptional and steals every scene she's in. garson kanin directed this piece of fluff and the cast is first rate, with robert drivas and brenda vaccaro especially memorable. a "9" out of "10."
