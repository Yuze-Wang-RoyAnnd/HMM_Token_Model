a boy and a girl is chased by a local warrior because the boy killed (by accident) the warriors father (or whoever he was). and they travel through the nature of africa's most ruff areas.<br /><br />the acting in this movie isn't that good (except for that elephant kid). but it's a very good adventure and it's not very censored, there is some blood, flesh and nudity (which lighten up the movie a bit).<br /><br />i give this movie a 7 because of it's picture of the african nature and it's action.
