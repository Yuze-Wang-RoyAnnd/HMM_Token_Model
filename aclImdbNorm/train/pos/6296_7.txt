parker (johnathan schaech) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break. in the meantime, he works as a telephone adviser for a manhattan psychic hotline. one day, most unfortunately, his apartment building burns down. parker and his cat make it out alive but are now stuck with the arduous task of finding affordable housing in the big apple. word comes to parker that a lady, samantha (alison eastwood) is searching for a roommate but will only accept a gay male. since parker is straight but the price is right, he decides to pretend that he is gay. samantha likes him from the start and welcomes him as her new cohabitant. but, poor parker. sam is lovely, intelligent and very desirable. how will he be able to keep his true nature under control? besides, doesn't sam have a successful businessman-boyfriend anyway? this is a sweet, likable, and humorous film with two very attractive stars in eastwood and schaech. naturally, the plot is a string of "how can i keep up this ruse" scenes, with sam asking parker for shampoo while she is showering or pleading with him to hold her in bed when she receives bad news. also, it is necessary for parker to produce his own "fake" gay mate, boris, when sam insists upon fixing him up with a man she knows. hopefully, the gay community will not find this too offensive, as this viewer thought most issues were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. for a small scale movie, the costumes, sets, and camera work were quite nice, also. therefore, if you love those funny tales of love, get this one soon. you will like what you see, i know it.
