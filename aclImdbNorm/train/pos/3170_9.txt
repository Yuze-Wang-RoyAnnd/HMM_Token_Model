writer/director/co-star adam jones is headed for great things. that is the thought i had after seeing his feature film "cross eyed". rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did. cleverly written and masterfully directed, "cross eyed" keeps you involved from beginning to end. adam jones may not be a well known name yet, but he will be. if this movie had one or two "named actors" it would be a box office sensation. i think it still has a chance to get seen by a main stream audience if just one film distributor takes the time to work this movie. regardless of where it ends up, if you get a chance to see it you won't be disappointed.
