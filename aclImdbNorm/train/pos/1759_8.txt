i'm not quite sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, im not even sure if this can be applied. on the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin. therefore, i considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as "serious comedies".<br /><br />does the 40 year old virgin fit into this guild? that is finally up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. you get to laugh a lot, plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations.<br /><br />i'm pretty there is more than one 40 year old virgin out there, and even the people whom do not exactly fit this specifications, may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men.<br /><br />the story, as the title says it, is about andy, a shy, silent guy, whom collects action figures, watches survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is asia.<br /><br />kal is andy's co-worker at smarttech. he believes andy to be a psychopath until andy's secret is revealed. kal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre.<br /><br />david is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, whom ran away with another guy. and jay, a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts.<br /><br />i'm pretty sure most youngsters from 13 to 21 have already watched this film, but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it. so in case you haven't seen it and will enjoy a little laugh, with social commentary, than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films.<br /><br />it also includes dvd bonuses which you'll really see from top to bottom.
