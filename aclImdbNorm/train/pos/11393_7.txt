uggh! i really wasn't that impressed by this film, though i must admit that it is technically well made. it does get a 7 for very high production values, but as for entertainment values, it is rather poor. in fact, i consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s. it won the oscar for best picture, but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing. that's because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting (such as meet me in st. louis), this movie is almost all singing and dancing. in fact, this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you aren't into this, the film will quickly bore you. give me more story! as a result, with overblown production numbers and a weak story, this film is like a steady diet of meringue--it just doesn't satisfy in the long run. <br /><br />to think...this is the film that beat out "a streetcar named desire" and "a place in the sun" for best picture! and, to make matters worse, "the african queen" and "ace in the hole" weren't even nominated in this category! even more amazing to me is that "ace in the hole" lost for best writing, screenplay to this film--even though "an american in paris" had hardly any story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song.
