a weird, witty and wonderful depiction of family life! writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny, foreboding and occasionally frightening! yes, don't be fooled by 2point4 children's cheerful tune and bubbly characters; the show has a dark side, and at times can be quite chilling. and that's what's so good about the show, it's not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a 2d comic device (the case with my family). instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full roller-coaster of human emotions. the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal, dark turn, that help add a little depth. of course the show is also incredibly funny, and is a guaranteed to make you smile. it's a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd. veoh.com is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops.
