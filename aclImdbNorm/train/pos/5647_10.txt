i don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! it was a great shame when it was canceled, and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again. the good news is that it is out on dvd!!!! i rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as i remembered it. gary cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character, and all actors were very good. it is a shame that the network did not continue it. shaun cassidy, this is a masterpiece. anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, must do so. you will not be disappointed. my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very interested, and will soon be a fan. she finds it "very twisted" and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen. i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired.<br /><br />this show rocks!!!!
