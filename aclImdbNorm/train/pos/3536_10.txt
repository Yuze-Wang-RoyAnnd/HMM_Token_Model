ea have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world. the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional. i got this game april 2007 (two years after release), and i am still impressed with the gameplay. it's a shame that ea will no longer make 007 games.<br /><br />i give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level. i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over. the only thing i didn't like in the game is the russian boat level, it was too much pressure. on the whole i like the game a lot!!
