from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life. the idea of two giant robots, manned by brilliant humans, fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced. i can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script. let's just just say it compares to both lord of rings pictures , combined. the academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is.....robot jox.
