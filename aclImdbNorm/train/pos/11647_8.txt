i can give you four reasons to see this movie:<br /><br />1. four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary mexican cinema.<br /><br />2. four good stories, related into a big scheme.<br /><br />3. a surprisingly good cast.<br /><br />4. a bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country (and many others).<br /><br />(possible spoilers)<br /><br />alejandro gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the extortion against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts. <br /><br />then antonio serrano gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the italian neorealism with a "peter and the wolf"-like anecdote.<br /><br />in the third story, the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context, carlos carrera tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment. but after the recent lynching at tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the state of mexico, this story couldn't be more updated.<br /><br />and at the end, fernando sari~nana returns to the dark humor in the "grand finale" in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed. reprising the center scene from one of his previous films "todo el poder", sari~nana gives the final lesson of the theme. and by the way, give us the scene that steals the movie with anna ciochetti making a brief striptease.<br /><br />once the movie has ended, you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie (and maybe enjoyed it) with a very painful subject. they say that in mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example. this film is a testimony of how mexicans have learn to live in the middle of a crime state(and perhaps accepted it), between two fires: the criminals and the so-called authorities full of corruption. even this movie is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they don't get this unhurt. if you had an assault without a scratch then you're lucky. meanwhile, don't lose the chance to see this movie, highly recommended.<br /><br />and it's a beautiful life in mexico...
