i've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have been, and discovered considerable artistic merit--which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing.<br /><br />first of all, this movie attempts "serious" science-fiction, social commentary, more than action-adventure. there is action in it, but that's not really what it's about. if you focus on that, you'll end up with (as others have noted) a bad "aliens" clone. but, again, that's not what it's about.<br /><br />the movie is really about todd's (kurt russell) transformation from human to near-machine and back to human (mostly *back*). but because it's not trying to give you a typically glib hollywood style answer, kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions. and he really does a wonderful job--it can take two viewings to appreciate it.<br /><br />the surrounding "social logic" is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human-ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.
