there are numerous films relating to ww2, but mother night is quite distinctive among them: in this film, we are introduced to howard campbell (nolte), an american living in berlin and married to a german, helga noth (lee), who decides to accept the role of a spy: more specifically, a cia agent major wirtanen (goodman) recruits campbell who becomes a nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the hitler regime. however, the deal is that the us government will never acknowledge campbell's role in the war for national security reasons, and so campbell becomes a hated figure across the us. after the war, he tries to conceal his identity, but the past comes back and haunts him. his only "friend" is wirtanen, but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor campbell...<br /><br />the story is deeply touching, as we watch the tragedy of campbell who although a great patriot, is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him. not only that, but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him, have many secrets of their own. vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere, with campbell's despair building up and almost choking the viewer.<br /><br />nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; he is even better than in "affliction", although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self-destruction. sheryl lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the whole cast in general.<br /><br />i haven't read the book, so i cannot appraise how the film compares to it. in any case, this is something of no importance here: my critique is upon the film per se, and the film wholeheartedly deserves a 9/10.
