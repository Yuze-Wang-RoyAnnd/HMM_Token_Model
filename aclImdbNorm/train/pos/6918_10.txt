a very enjoyable film that features characters who do bad things and who let emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance bubble over. the cast is very good, there's plenty of action, and stewart gets the girl and his revenge (with a twist) in the end. i've seen this film several times, and always watch when it's on amc or cable. highly recommended...
