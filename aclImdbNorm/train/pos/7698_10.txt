but this is a great martial arts film. liu chia liang ranks second to none as a fight choreographer, only sammo hung at his best compares. this is immediately clear from his proud exhibition of technique -rather than flashy camera angles etc. - during fights. the direction is tightly controlled to not only excite the viewer by the speed and movement but to awe her with the precise skill displayed. this film benefits also from liu's participation in front of the camera. liu's performance at the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the high points in kung fu movie history. liu is supported by the beautiful and talented hui ying hung (of my young auntie fame) and 'hsiao hou' whose acrobatics are breathtaking, and preferable to any amount of wirework as for the plot , this film follows the not uncommon theme of revenge, but with character and moral development along the way, and a most fitting resolution. the humour in this is also of the best. if you only watch one kung fu film ever, this would be a good choice- it has it all.
