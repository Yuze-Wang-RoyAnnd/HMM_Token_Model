the person's comment that said that pat robertson is evil and his program is evil has nothing to compare what evil and righteous is. his definition of evil is the opposite of evil. the bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good! he doesn't even know that he fulfilled bible prophecy! if you don't know god and refuse to know him now, that's okay. he still loves you but when you do finally bow your knee to him, and you will, it will be too late for you. god sends no one to hell, not even you! you will go there of your own decision and your spewing defines it! may god have mercy on you and give you a damascus road experience. the 700 club and pat robertson's ministry is one of the reasons i'm still here. on the edge of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, god reached through the tv screen and used pat robertson to do it, and thank god he did! you have a right to say what you said but you don't have a right to curse with your words. god have mercy on you.
