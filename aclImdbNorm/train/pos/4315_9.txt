i just watched this film again and remain dismayed at the number of cynics who dismiss it as just new age pap. a great film, one that takes its time to develop, it keeps coming close to going over the edge but never does and ultimately is meditative, affecting, and truer to life than most films people who dismiss its "coincidences" can see. i was angry at the time that movies like "prince of tides" and "bugsy" (though i liked the latter) were nominated for best picture that year (let alone that "silence of the lambs" won!) and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay. upon revisiting it, i think history supports my initial reaction!
