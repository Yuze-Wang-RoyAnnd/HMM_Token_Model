i first saw this film when i was flipping through the movie channels on my parents directv. it was on the sundance channel and was just starting. i love music, especially late 60s and this is what the bjm sounded like (the dandys are alright). everything about the brian jonestown massacre intrigued me from the music, to anton and joel's personalities, to the illicit drug use. it was funny because as i was watching the first party scene when everyone is doing lines my parents walked by and decided to watch (the look on their faces were priceless). anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the brian jonestown massacre who is now my favorite band of all time.<br /><br />just watch it... seriously
