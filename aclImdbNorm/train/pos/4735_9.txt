i saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it. then i went home and watched it with subtitles and i loved it. i am ready to watch it again.<br /><br />i am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian? the scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my favortites.<br /><br />of course the martial arts are stunning. there is really not much i can say about them if you are familiar with the hk style. however, if you are not... we paused playback briefly and walker, texas ranger was on. we noticed that after every strike there was a cut. not in black mask.<br /><br />
