i was curious to know how critics responded to this rousing, inspiring film, so i went to rotten tomatoes and was dismayed to discover that the pompous peanut gallery that is our nation's film critics had given the film an average 43% (or "rotten") rating.<br /><br />all i can say is, if this movie doesn't move you, you have no heart. (it's interesting to note that the same film on the same website got a 74% rating from viewers).<br /><br />not that the opinion of critics is all that important to me. after all, i can't think of a more useless, overpaid profession. some schmo gets paid to go to the movies (what a tough life) and does the same thing everyone else on the planet does: forms an opinion. but these chumps have a way of coming across like their opinion somehow matters more than yours, and even worse, they love to hate.<br /><br />i'll grant you that this movie is old fashioned (well, except for the f-bombs), syrupy, and a little predictable... after all, you know right from the beginning that cuba gooding jr., portraying real-life navy hero carl brashear, is going to triumph (eventually) at every turn simply by the way he comes across: determined and plucky; strong-willed and optimistic.<br /><br />but his performance and that of de niro (as billy sunday, a composite character of several real-life people) are so strong, so inspiring, that you'll be on your feet cheering many of the film's scenes, especially the courtroom climax. you'd have to be a real stick in the mud not to be moved by these scenes. like our nation's film critics. michael rappaport is excellent as well as a sweet-natured, stuttering diving student that befriends gooding's brashear. if anyone has seen "higher learning", this character totally redeems that character.<br /><br />anyway, this confirms what i've always felt: don't listen to critics. see this movie and get inspired.
