i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own. maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously. i believed totally in the poor character's psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. i'm giving all the credit to polanski's artistry in his direction, his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager. luckily for me, my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this (so far) but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the (fake) reality he is trying to convey. simply put, the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. this film is the sum of many, many instances of great acting and great casting. as some performances were done in english (the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others) and others in french (with most other characters) and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french, i heartily recommend, if you happen to be bilingual, to switch the audio from french to english and vice-versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd. this film is part of polanski's so-called "apartment building trilogy" which also comprises "repulsion" and "rosemary's baby". unfortunately, "repulsion" still hasn't made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1. needless to say, the three films would make a magnificent boxset.
