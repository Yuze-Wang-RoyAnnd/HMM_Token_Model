first of all, i don't understand why some people find this movie so anti-american. sure, there are moments when the u.s. are accused directly, like at the segments of youssef chahine, ken loach and, to a certain extent, mira nair. but come on, they aren't naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents that the cia released about chile confirms this, for example.<br /><br />but returning to the film itself, what i enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it. we find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of september 11 and react differently to this, with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness.<br /><br />all these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of september 11th. thus, what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks, and this may make some people infuriated; but this is the world where we live, and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies, regardless of what presidents or priests may say us.<br /><br />finally, i think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the united states of america. it's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened, and this movie could give some clues to them. this film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future, and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today.
