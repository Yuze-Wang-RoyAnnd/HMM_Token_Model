i spent 5 hours drenched in this film. nothing i have ever seen comes close to the delicious funk this film left me in. never mind females advanced aging dilemma's, human fear vaults off the screen for your viewing. personally engaging to the ninth degree, the film invests one with an undeniable shared feeling for our lives'. i enjoyed this dalliance with raw wounded gall deep from within. it empowers a mutually shared vestment in the history of human encounters reaching far deeper into the pain, isolation and skewed views of self and others. the result forgives our tepid forming of a bridge away from the muddy sludge of dead we must encounter. the birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit. the effort for realism intersects with the dark ground of our bankrupt culture.
