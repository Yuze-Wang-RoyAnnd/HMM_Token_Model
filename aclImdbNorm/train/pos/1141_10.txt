anyone who doesn't laugh all through this movie has been embalmed. i have watched it at least twenty times and i still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes. sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise. fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children. i'm biased, i'm in love with her.<br /><br />the cast of "soapdish" is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection. kevin kline is flawless, as are robert downey jr., an ing'enue elizabeth shue, whoopi goldberg, teri hatcher in one of her early roles, carrie fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on. kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer, and best of all, cathy moriarty as nurse nan who leads the plot to get fields character removed from the show is hilarious.<br /><br />this movie should have won oscars for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. get the dvd so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years. you will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out.
