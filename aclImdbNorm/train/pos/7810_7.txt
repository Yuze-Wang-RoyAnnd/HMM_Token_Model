what is "cry freedom" like? it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people. main character of the story is donald woods (kevin kline), chief editor of the newspaper daily dispatch in south africa. woods writes several articles, where he speaks critically about views of steve biko (denzel washington). soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa (right from the top, even from the chief of police). when biko dies in police custody, woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it. but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place, so world can find out the truth.<br /><br />attenborough managed to make a good movie about people, with main message that black and white are the same, cause we are all people. story leads us to south africa and this (movie) is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i'm disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie. this is movie from which we all can learn something. although it is a bit long, this story couldn't be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko. <br /><br />also relationship between woods and biko was shown great, just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through. but sometimes sacrifices must be made (biko's death) so the truth could be reveled (woods book).
