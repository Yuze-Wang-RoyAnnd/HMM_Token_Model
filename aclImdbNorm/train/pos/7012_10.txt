although a tear jerker it is definitely a "feel good" movie. all the actors were excellent and will smith as always, does the job and does it well. i could go on but pick any ten of the "10" ratings and they've said it as well and likely better than i could. <br /><br />but, since i must include at least 10 lines to post a comment i will say that rosario dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. her performance was most enjoyable and i look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come.<br /><br />and, this film demonstrates that will smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.
