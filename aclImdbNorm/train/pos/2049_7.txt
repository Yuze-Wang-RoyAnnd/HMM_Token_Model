this movie is pretty cheesy, but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it's principles. there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well.<br /><br />the aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie.<br /><br />i guess i really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran. sure it's not all that well done, but the premise is not at all bad.<br /><br />tom
