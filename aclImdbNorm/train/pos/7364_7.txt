it isn't always easy to explain what a movie is like, but this time i think i've found it. it reminded me of two movies: trainspotting (small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in schotland) and the blair witch project (because of the style of filming).<br /><br />it's about the loyalty between two friends, one of them is coming out of jail, the other one hasn't been caught yet. with a stolen vehicle they drive through the scottish countryside but than run out of petrol. as they try to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. the farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them. than it all goes wrong. one of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. what follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of schotland. the two friends literally have to run for their lives.<br /><br />apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time. ok, that's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place: the scottish countryside, but i still find that quite amazing. especially because this isn't actually a bad movie. it's perhaps not the greatest movie ever, but they still can be proud of what they achieved. i had a nice time watching it and overall i enjoyed the movie. i give it a 7/10.
