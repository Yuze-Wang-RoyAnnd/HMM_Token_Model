i have just started watching the tv series "what i like about you" and i must say that is a joy to watch. i always like to see new shows do well considering a lot of shows go off before you really get a feel for them. i have watched amanda bynes since "all that" she is truly a funny girl, what is the best about her comedy is that its so natural and what i mean about that is, its something that a person could here there best friend saying, its not rehearsed.<br /><br />i just recently started watching the show and have fell in love. i am just watching re-runs as of now but am looking forward to the next season. all the characters in the show give something to the whole story line. its nice to see some old face from other shows i enjoyed watching in the past such as, jennie garth from "90210", leslie grossman from "popular", and wesley jonathan from "city guys." the new character are very talented as well, nick zano has that charm the makes you love him even when he is doing something wrong to holly (bynes).<br /><br />overall this show has the right ingredients to be successful, i look forward to watching it grow.
