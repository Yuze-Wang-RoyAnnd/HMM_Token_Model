i have loved this movie since i first saw it in 1979. i'm still amazed at how accurately kurt russell portrays elvis, right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face. sometimes its scary how much he looks, acts, and talks like the real elvis. thankfully this is being released on dvd, so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film. i have heard the detractors, who say that there are some inaccuracies, or some things left out, but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work with, and that this was being shown on television (just two years after elvis's death!) that he did a fine job with this. in fact i haven't seen another elvis movie that even comes close to this one. highly recommended.
