i have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it's awesome. but the only thing with it was that in the beginning, there was too much talk of who's going out with who. i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it. but on the official site, they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it. what's even happened to patty dunning now? she is a pretty good actress. she has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s, but we haven't heard from her since. i know for sure about thom rachford, who plays jerry, works for accounting at rd films. but overall, i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school.
