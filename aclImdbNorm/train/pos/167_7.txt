"dance, fools, dance" is an early crawford-gable vehicle from 1931. crawford plays a bonnie jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, booze, and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming. this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (william blakewell) penniless. bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith; her brother goes to work for bootleggers. the head man is jake luva - portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook. later, of course, he would turn into a romantic hero, but in the early '30s, mgm used him as a bad guy. not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity, bonnie cozies up to luva.<br /><br />gable and crawford made a great team. her facial expressions are a little on the wild side, but that, along with her dancing, is one of the things that makes the movie fun. look for cliff edwards, the voice of jiminy cricket, as bert.<br /><br />it's always interesting to see the precode movies, and "dance, fools, dance" is no exception.
