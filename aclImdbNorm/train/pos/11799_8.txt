a well cast summary of a real event! well, actually, i wasn't there, but i think this is how it may have been like. i think there are two typically american standpoints evident in the film: 'communistophobia' and parallels to adolf hitler. these should be evident to most independent observers. anyway, boothe does a great performance, and so do lots of other well-known actors. the last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable - and i mean it! anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (that's why it's so terrible - it all happened, and it probably looked just like that). but, actually, did that last scene on the air station really take place?
