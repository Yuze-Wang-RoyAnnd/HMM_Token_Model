lily mars, a smalltown girl living in indiana, dreams of making it big on broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful broadway producer john thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. lily tries everything she can to get thornway to notice her, but he just gets annoyed with her antics. when thornway goes back to new york to stage his show, lily follows (unknown to john of course) and thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show, only as a favor to her family, however thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms, which makes the show's leading lady, isabel rekay, jealous. when isabel gets fed up with the john-lily romance causing friction with the show, she leaves, and john decides to make lily the star. isabel returns later, and thornway is forced to tell lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play, which also may jeopardize the romance. very charming film, and a refreshing change to see garland put the comedic touches into her role (her reading of lady macbeth, while supposed to be humorous, never threatened her singing career) i enjoyed heflin's character (thornway) more when he was annoyed with lily rather than be the romantic. the film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together, but a very enjoyable film. rating, 7.
