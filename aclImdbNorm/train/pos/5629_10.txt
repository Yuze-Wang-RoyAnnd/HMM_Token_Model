i loved this excellent movie. farrah fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart. she plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger. after being rejected by the police she realizes she is on her own.<br /><br />then one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again. not being about to call the police or get him out she is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprisons him in her fireplace.<br /><br />i think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land. they are too easy on these criminals. it's time for more harsh punishments.
