ok, here is my personal list of top nicktoons shows as in today:<br /><br />1. all grown up/spongebob squarepants<br /><br />2. my life as a teenage robot<br /><br />3. invader zim<br /><br />4. catscratch/rugrats<br /><br />notice a word with only capital letters? that means this is the nick show i'm going to talk about.<br /><br />"catscratch" is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three wealthy cats - mr. blik, gordon, and waffles - who get into weird and really surreal situations, from attempting to join human kimberely's slumber party for root beer to saving a planet of slugs from the evil spaceship. this is one nick show that you will simply have your funny bone tickled sooner or later! the theme song is catchy and memorable. voice actors - including wayne knight from the "seinfield" franchise - brings the characters to fresh life with very quirky personalities. the stories are enjoyable (fans' episodes would be "king of all root beer" and "gordon's lucky claw"). and the humor is all done in some style of earthworm jim. <br /><br />so in conclusion, "catscratch" is one of the nicktoons series, like "invader zim" and "mlaatr", which becomes very, very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less.
