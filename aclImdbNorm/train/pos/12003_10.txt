as a convert into the church of jesus christ of latter day saints, i try to absorb as much as i can of my new religion's history. i was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons & the other young men & women as well as their families of our ward. <br /><br />on a beautiful spring evening, we drove to kirtland, ohio to the church's historical village located there. we were to have had reservations at the vistor's center to view this movie. since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries, i was intrigued. the only "full length motion pictures" of the church's i had seen was "legacy" and "my best two years", both which i thought were very well written and preformed.<br /><br />at the beginning, the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie. i thought "ok...but it takes a lot to move me to tears." imagine my surprise when i found myself sobbing! it truly is a very moving & inspirational testament to the prophet joseph smith.<br /><br />see it & believe in it's powerful message!
