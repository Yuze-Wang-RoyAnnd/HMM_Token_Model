writer/director henry brommel has done a wonderful job with his film, "panic," from the year 2000, and that includes his choice of cast: william h. macy, tracy ullman, john ritter, neve campbell, donald sutherland, barbara bain, david dorfman. brommel has cast ullman and ritter in decidedly un-funny roles, and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see.<br /><br />"panic" is the story of a hit man, alex (macy) who actually works for his father (sutherland). he covers his true profession by doing mail order work; by all appearances, he and his wife (ullman) and their son sammy (dorfman) are a typical suburban family. unhappy with his life, alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (ritter), telling only his mother (bain). in the waiting room, he meets a young woman (campbell) to whom he is immediately attracted, which complicates his situation further. his mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. when alex receives his next assignment, he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist.<br /><br />this is a profound story of a gentle, good man made into a killer by a monster of a father, with his mother's knowledge, who kills to please his father but also can't stand up to him and quit. his rage is so deep-seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and it's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression. when it's time for "panic" to moves, it does - quickly.<br /><br />"panic" doesn't seem panicked at all. in fact, it moves very slowly. but it moves slowly not because it's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate, mirroring alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog. by making a decision about sara, the campbell character, and by seeing his mark, his own psychiatrist, as a living, breathing human being, alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is -and how they don't jive. and the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche, sammy's.<br /><br />william macy gives another brilliant performance, as a loving father, a distant husband, and a cold killer, the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires, a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated.<br /><br />this is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. it's too adult, too small, too subtle, too character-driven, and too good.
