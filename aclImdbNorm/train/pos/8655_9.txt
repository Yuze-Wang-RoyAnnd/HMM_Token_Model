"kalifornia" is one of my all-time favourite movies, and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s. the film has a very stylish surface to it, but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others. one of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances, brad pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named early. pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. juliette lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heart-breaking. "kalifornia" has a very simple plot to it, that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour, but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder, as pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. there are alot of shocking scenes, and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. "kalifonia" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore.
