this is a warm, funny film, in much the same vein as the works of almodovar. sure it has a 10 year old boy sucking milk from breasts, but the style is so playful that i can't understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted (but would i be willing to let my 10-year old son play the part? not so sure!). <br /><br />spanish cinema is often quite sexual, but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink. i think that we if we northern european types had the same attitude, we'd be much better off as a result.<br /><br />this liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious 'fartman maurice' character. as his lover says to him: 'most people are embarrassed about farting. you turn it into an art form.'
