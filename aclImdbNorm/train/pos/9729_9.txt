weak start, solid middle, fantastic finish. that's my impression of this film, anyway. i liked simon pegg in the two films i've seen him in--- hot fuzz, and shaun of the dead. his role here, though, took a completely different turn. shows his range as an actor, but nonetheless i really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning.<br /><br />there's a kind of humour i call "frustration comedy." its supposed "jokes" and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments. much like the bean character rowan atkinmson plays. there are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too. i don't mean to bash them here, so will not.<br /><br />but do be warned that if you are like me, and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots, pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film. it does get better, however.<br /><br />i read somewhere that this is based on a true story. hmmm. maybe. the film's story stopped being annoying, and became kind of a triumph of the "little guy" in the final third. i don't need all films to be sugar and light--- but coincidentally, as this film got better, it also started to be more and more of a happy ending.<br /><br />it was also a pleasure to see an old favourite, jeff bridges, play a role so masterfully. i liked "iron man," but was saddened by the fact that bridges' character was a villain. purely personal taste, of course, as his acting in that was superb. nonetheless, he was a marvel here as the bigger than life man of vision, the publisher of sharps. it was nice to see him in a role that i could actually enjoy.<br /><br />overall then, i liked it! i just wish i had come in 40 minutes late, and missed the beginning.
