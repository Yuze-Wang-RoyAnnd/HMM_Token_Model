the movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too. it was extremely funny. angelena jolie was wonderful as juliet. the parents are hilarious.they are caterers as well as enemies.the kids play the parts of romeo and juliet in the church play.they fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart.(spoiler ahead. i think) they sneak off after a party and do it. surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie. if you don't like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature don't watch. if you don't mind those you will have a blast watching this one.
