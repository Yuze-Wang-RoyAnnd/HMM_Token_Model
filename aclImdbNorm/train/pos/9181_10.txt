i had no idea what jane eyre was before i saw this miniseries. i had read and watched many classics before, and i believed that most classics were boring, over-worded, and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best. this jane eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions.<br /><br />zelah clarke is a fabulous actress, and she gives a wonderful portrayal of jane eyre. her accent is delightful and her quiet, yet firm nature matches the young governess' character exactly. timothy dalton is an amazing rochester. his passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of thornfield hall. i couldn't sleep at all the night after i had watched this miniseries. the plot is both haunting and inspiring. the characters are masterfully performed, and the story is incredible. this is the best version of jane eyre to ever appear on film.<br /><br />i read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed charolette bronte's writing. jane eyre is now my favorite film and book. if you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, watch the 1983 bbc version of jane eyre.
