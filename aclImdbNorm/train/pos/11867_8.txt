i had the privilege of watching scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release. it was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough. <br /><br />scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring al pacino as cuban drug lord tony montana. in this version, tony comes to america during the cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s, early 1980s. tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in tent city and after a brief stay at a cuban restaurant; tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction. <br /><br />many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch i have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years. robert loggia as tony's patron, frank lopez is wonderful. his character is flawed by being too trusting, and as tony quickly figures out, soft. lopez's right hand, omar suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors, f. murray abraham (amadeus.) suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for frank; it is like he does not have a mind of his own. tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with suarez, but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top. the character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is mel bernstein, the audaciously corrupt miami narcotics detective played by harris yulin (training day.) mel, without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry. he plays tony off of frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both frank and mel. it is priceless to hear frank asking for mel to intercede, as tony is about to kill him only to hear mel reply, `it's your tree frank, you're sitting in it.' this is from the man who frank had been paying for protection!<br /><br />tony's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn. after offing frank and taking his wife and business tony's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough. as tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs, greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married. this all sets up the ending in which tony's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered. this all stems form a compassionate moment when tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim's wife and children.<br /><br />all in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture. depalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around. the violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind, particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen, the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie. this is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish, or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels; depalma let it all fly right here.
