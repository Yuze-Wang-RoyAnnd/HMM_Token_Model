i first saw this movie in a theater in france a year or so ago. it came and went with little fanfare, but i enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife footage. (the story, while nice, is really incidental. if you actually thought about it, there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life.) i just saw it again tonight, here in the states, on dvd. again, i gather it has very limited distribution. blockbusters only had one copy of it, and i don't recall it ever playing in the art houses in cleveland.<br /><br />seen on my tv, the photography is not as breathtaking, though it is still very beautiful. the wildlife footage is still fascinating. the story of the relationship between the 10-year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around, when you know where it's headed.<br /><br />still, as i said, the story is incidental. it's a beautiful film to watch, and if you like wildlife footage, you should find this fascinating.
