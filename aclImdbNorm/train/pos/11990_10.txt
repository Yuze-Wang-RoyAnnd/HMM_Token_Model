in the year 1990, the world of disney tv cartoons was certainly at it's prime. shows like chip n dale rescue rangers, ducktales and gummi bears was already popular, and now disney made another great cartoon and that cartoon brought the birth of the disney afternoon. that cartoon is called talespin. it's about old jungle book character baloo the bear as he gets a job in the plane business. in the series he meets kit cloudkicker, former air pirate and good cloud surfer, business lady rebecca cunningham and her hyperactive daughter molly. this series is very funny and has tons of great puns that you may not understand as a kid but understand later on in life. this is one cleverly written series and it's great to add to your dvd collection. parents, buy this for your kids rather letting them watch all of those horrible nickelodeon cartoons. if you liked talespin, then check out "darkwing duck" and "goof troop". spin it!
