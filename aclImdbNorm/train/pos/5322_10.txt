a true dark noir movie and a very graphic film, nice storyline of a man pursuing redemption, that may have just left it all too late. visually there are some really nice scenes artistically amazing as to what can be done with a minimal budget. full marks to gareth maxwell roberts and team, i look forward to the next project with new ideas although hopefully more british actors would be great. lisa ray looked lovely not seen her before and hope to see her again in the future. subject all interesting sex,drugs and violence. bring it on. i would definitely say to rent this one and check it out if you're in the mood for a semi moody noir.
