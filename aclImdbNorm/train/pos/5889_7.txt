alright, i have to admit that i have never seen "rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "the mary tyler moore show." even though i don't know anything about this duo of comedic talent, i still liked this movie a lot.<br /><br />mary goes back to work. rose tries her luck at being a comedian. rhoda struggles with a photography career. and meredith...what exactly does she do again? these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way. when the two long time friends reunite, it only makes the film better. <br /><br />i was surprised about how good the writing was. the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny. the script itself was very well put together.<br /><br />i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good. but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team. while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie, they never seem to let me down. (during the run of this movie.) joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great. the rest of the cast like jonah, cecile and....everybody else also works well together.<br /><br />being that this is a reunion, you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this. from a non-fan i still enjoyed this little get-together. good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good. (the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn't hurt either.)
