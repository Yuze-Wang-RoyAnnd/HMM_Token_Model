i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is. suffice it to say, anytime i'm depressed about how unfair or futile things seem, this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind. the background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness. the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard, and is happy as a result. persifina, the laundry co-worker of ruby's (ashley judd) is another=-her eyes and smile could make the hardest person's day. i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends, and i realize that being alone--ruby is alone quite often--isn't the same as being lonely. recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie.
