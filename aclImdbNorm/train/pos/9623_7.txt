hmmmm, want a little romance with your mystery? this has it. i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie. but how could the romance be ditched when the story's borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel, whatever the heck that is. had the romance been ditched, the story might have been a little too weak. the mystery here wasn't too bad, quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage. oh well. i thought mel harris was pretty good; her short skirts, i think, added some sex appeal... but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast, maybe with a more well known tv movie actor. the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on - both could have been a little edgier, a little darker, more adventurous. one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations. that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest. possibly a drawback was the director and/or cinematographer's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect. not good. had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen, picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background. this was just a tv-movie, though, so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery. overall, twasn't really a bad movie. i'll tell you what, this was absolutely the best canadian-hungarian production i have ever seen! (and the only that i know of.) i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made-for-tv movie, giving it a grade of c-
