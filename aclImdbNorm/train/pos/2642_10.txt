truly this is a 'heart-warming' film. it won the george peobody award, winning over "roots", so that may tell you something of the essence of this film. i am looking on the internet how to order this movie since my former father-in-law, eugene logan, the co-writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so i no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him. i would love to have his only grand-daughters, my daughters, see this film, as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great-grandsons. my oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and i since have been looking forward to seeing it again. one of my friends said it was her favorite movie. i won't 'spoil' this movie for you.
