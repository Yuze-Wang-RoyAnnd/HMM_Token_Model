i've loved this movie ever since it first came out. i was about nine years old, and now i'm 27. i remember playing the video game on sega genisis. i had so much fun, i would love to show my son this movie. he likes michael jackson as well and i know he will love this movie just as i did when i was a kid. even though he's much younger than i was when i first saw it. i can't wait for it to come out on dvd! i hope it comes out on dvd! please let it come out on dvd!! i'm dying to see it again!!! well that is my comment i hope that one day soon i'll get to view this movie again. i love all of the videos in this movie. my favorite mini-video is badder!
