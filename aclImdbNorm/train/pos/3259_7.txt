this isn't the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable. it's directed in an old-fashioned way and that works fine. cybill shepherd as corinne isn't bad in her role as the woman who can't get over her husband's death. she has a sexy maturity. but i can't say much for ryan o'neal as philip, because he is, at best, nondescript. he may be adequate in the role, but that's not good enough.<br /><br />however, i get the feeling that some of the characters, particularly alex and miranda, are not written with enough in-depth thought. we don't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick, and the writers don't tell us much beyond what happens. but that problem was salvaged because mary stuart masterson has a fresh-as-a-daisy sweetness to brighten it up, and robert downey jr. is so charming that he melts the screen. even his smile is infectious. and it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes.<br /><br />anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way, why not give it a try.<br /><br />
