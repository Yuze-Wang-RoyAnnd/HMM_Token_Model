i can't say whether the post-wwii british comedies produced at the ealing studios are an acquired taste or not, but i am completely addicted, and the man in the white suit is one of the best. no need to go into the well-known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic sidney stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight. many of the well-known faces from the world of british character actors - the nervous cecil parker, the suavely devious michael gough, and the bluntly ruthless ernest thesinger - put in wonderful performances. guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and joan greenwood is delectable as daphne (just the way she enunciates the word "daddy", makes the entire movie worth seeing).<br /><br />"knudsen!!!!!!!"
