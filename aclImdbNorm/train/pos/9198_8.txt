b movie? yes. diy? yes. first movie? yes. but aestheically a+. this movie definitely had some bad sound/editing/lighting/acting/etc. etc. problems. however, this movie has many positive things about it. first off, the most annoying character dies first! second, its made to be a parody/funny b rated horror movie. the comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing.<br /><br />the problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece. take it for what it is, a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie. for what it is, just that, it is really good.
