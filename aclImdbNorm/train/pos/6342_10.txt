in a word - excellent. this is the movie. go and see it. the director ron howard... i mean, the director ron howard did a fantastic job, as he usually does. an incredible attention to detail, vivid colors and decorations, breathtaking whoville atmosphere, astonishing variety of costumes. wait, there's more to it than that - the story is very good, too. there's clearly a message to be extracted from it by the thoughtful viewers. jim carrey is top-notch. he is probably the best grinch possible. the girl, taylor momsen, is real good. i'm sure she has some great future. the dog is cool. all in all, it's a very high quality christmas fairy-tale. if you like fairy-tales, it's for you. if you like christmas, it's for you.<br /><br />reading some other reviews here... get a life. it hurts me every time to see people out there who... well... got their hearts two sizes too small.
