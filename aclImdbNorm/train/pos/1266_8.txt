i read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to cape fear. i completely disagree. i'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there. i thought the casting was perfect. i thought this was one of ed harris's best performances. what an evil psychopath!!! i have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie. i was riveted throughout this movie. if you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see. i also noticed a young scarlett johannson in this movie. this movie is filled with top stars and i highly recommend it!
