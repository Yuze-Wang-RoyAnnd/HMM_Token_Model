i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as well done as they were, nor did i expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original. this movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and i'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it. i especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick, nor did it over embellish that fact. the characters all had human traits. the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives. i give this movie two thumbs so far up. definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years.
