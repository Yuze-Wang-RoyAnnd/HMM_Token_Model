i never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box. i always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90's. but after i saw on the internet that this was meant for the tv, i was shocked because for a television film, it is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />the thing that mostly concerned me was the length. i felt that the one on one battle scene should've been removed as it was completely unnecessary. also, it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end. <br /><br />on the plus side, there is a strong, very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone. i just felt that patrik frayze looked a bit haggard. i also felt that gogool, who looked dementing turned a bit stupid at some scenes.<br /><br />i was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of africa. also, the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9. still, its a great film for the television. 8 out of 10.
