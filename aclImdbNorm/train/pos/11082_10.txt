i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid, and, naturally, was moved to tears by this story of a fox family. the fantastic scenery at hokkaid^o, the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists. i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack. to german viewers it might be useful to know that the defa-dubbing is the only one worth listening to. i taped both (defa and br) but i keep viewing the first one only.
