''the 40 year old virgin'''made me laugh a lot. i don't care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy, i just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. steve carell is perfect as the virgin nerd andy stitzer and i think the scene where andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest, specially because it is real. many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous,by the way.<br /><br />andy stitzer has a peaceful life. he is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys, but seems harmless. one day, while playing poker with his friends of his work, they discover that andy is in fact...virgin! and he is already 40 years old! after this surprising revelation, all his friends are trying to make andy sleep with a woman...the problem is the confusions in which andy gets in,specially now that he is really starting to like trish, a woman he met when she was buying a dvd player in the store he works at.
