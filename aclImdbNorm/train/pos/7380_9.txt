the three main characters are very well portrayed, especially anisio by rock musician turned into first time actor paulo miklos. he is extremely convincing as the lower class trespasser/invader. the film shows very well the snowball effect of getting involved in ever more shady business, the contrast and similarities between the lower and higher classes. how everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition. 9-9,5 out of 10.
