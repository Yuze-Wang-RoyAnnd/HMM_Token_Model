i am extremely picky about the films i see. i'd heard about moon child completely by accident. i've been a fan of l'arc en ciel for some time and a fan of gackt and mizer only recently.<br /><br />i finally found out the film was being re-released and picked it up without a second thought.<br /><br />being as critical as i am about films, i will admit, the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times...but they're meant too be, as another user suggested, it's the quintessential calm before the storm, quoting gary oldman from leon...without getting into the spoilers, the film hit me extremely hard, because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and like marriage, it's until death do you part.<br /><br />hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics, their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one's soul and evoke response emotionally.<br /><br />upon seeing the film for the first time, i realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes. i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in film...this takes an entirely new direction using classic yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from ryo ishibashi of takashi miike's "audition" and "suicide club" fame?<br /><br />man..i just can't say enough about this film, but i'll stop here.<br /><br />10/10
