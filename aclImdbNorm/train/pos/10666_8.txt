when i really began to be interested in movies, at the age of eleven, i had a big list of 'must see' films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend; some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts. i remember one of the films on that list was "a chorus line" and could never get it; so now to see it is a dream come true.<br /><br />of course, i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there. i mean, take "a chorus line", a stage play turned into film. i know it's something we see a lot nowadays, but back then it was a little different, apparently; and this film has something special.<br /><br />most of the musicals made movies today, take the chance the camera gives them for free, to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places; "a chorus line" was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie. following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach (michael douglas), richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job.<br /><br />everything happens on the same day: the tension of not knowing, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the silent competition between the dancers
