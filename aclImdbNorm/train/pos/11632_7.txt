greetings again from the darkness. what a relief ... a thriller that actually is thrilling! new "it" girl rachel mcadams ("wedding crashers" and "the notebook") dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director wes craven ("scream" movies and "a nightmare on elm street"). craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane.<br /><br />what makes this one work, is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes as we see mcadams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone. she is a natural. when she meets cillian murphy (the scarecrow in "batman begins") in what appears to be happenstance, the film really takes flight. watching the two yuppie-types flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing, is bewitching film-making! the plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic. craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue.<br /><br />as with many thrillers, the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero. an interesting plot device leads us to believe little rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through, but we can't help but cringe a bit. the most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests, an annoying airline passenger, cillian's injury and the fx at the hotel. the strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads. sadly the fine screen veteran brian cox is under-utilized, but overall this is an above-average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale.
