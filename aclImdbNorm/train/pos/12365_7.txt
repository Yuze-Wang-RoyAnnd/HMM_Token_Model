i'm surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film. the lion's share of the footage in both is identical, but here is where they differ: in one version (the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv), the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the "brotherhood of the protectors", a (fictional) splinter group of priests and brothers "excommunicated" by the church. in the other version, which i've seen only once on tv, the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official church, meaning the archdiocese of new york (or perhaps brooklyn). also, in the former version, in most of the pertinent scenes, the clerics are referred to as "brothers" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips say "father" so-and-so but the dubbed audio says "brother" so-and-so. in the latter version, i believe everyone is referred to as "father".<br /><br />in any event, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re-shooting of the other, with all "brotherhood of the protector" scenes re-shot as "archdiocese" scenes, or vice versa. (kind of reminds me of the raymond burr cutaway scenes in "godzilla"). i have videotaped both versions off broadcast tv, so no, i'm not imagining this. can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film?
