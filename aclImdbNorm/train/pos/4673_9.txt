one of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the fly. i suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters. the premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and/or analogy for what families/siblings go through in life. the complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting. also, although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to (i.e. jewish/twins/family business) the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it. that made it very engaging.
