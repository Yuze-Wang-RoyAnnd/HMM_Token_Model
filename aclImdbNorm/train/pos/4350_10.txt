this film is one of those that has a resounding familiarity to it. it is earthy, grounded and a film that will make you think...and smile. paul reiser and peter falk take you on a journey that you will not forget. the soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. this surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors! finally, a piece of art that departs from the obvious love story and the frequent special affects that are seen today. never have i walked out from a movie with such deep warmth and feeling of thoughtfulness in my heart; for it felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket. to see this film is to find a real treasure and delight in it.
