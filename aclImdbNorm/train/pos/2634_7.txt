lion king 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. don't expect the production values of a theatrical release, but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release.<br /><br />it is set up as timon & pumba begin watching the original lion king in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story. this is done with frequent comedic interruptions. for example, during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined pumba realizes he has sat on the remote. these little moments pepper the movie, and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor. if you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie, than this may not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />animation is the best they've invested in the disney dtv line, and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material. the newer, independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original. the voice talents are all well performed, though i couldn't help thinking of marge simpson every time i heard julie kavner.<br /><br />many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations, but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive.<br /><br />the music has made me realize how much i enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a disney feature. the toe-tapping opening feature of 'dig a tunnel' is well choreographed and hilarious. timon and pumba's take on the lion king's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing. the only problem was the reprise of the 'dig a tunnel' at the end of the movie, switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to uplifting.<br /><br />story line is pretty well done, and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly, though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little. the new story doesn't seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well, and does better when it is resorting to full comedy. <br /><br />overall, worth purchasing. if you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, then go for it. for the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick, wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away. <br /><br />damion crowley.
