you play as b.j. blazkowicz, a us secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover nazi secret and turn the tide of world war ii. that means everything from breaking out of a nazi dungeon to thwarting hitler's war machine and even the fuhrer himself.<br /><br />this is quite possibly the most influential game of its time. that's because it literally inspired obsession. many games existed at the time and even more do today, but every so often you get a real grabber. this is one of them. just like tetris before it and more recently gta iii in 2002. yes, doom is better in almost every respect, but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming's biggest tidal waves were fired by b.j. blazkowicz. the space marine, duke nukem, max payne, serious sam, john mullins, jc denton, agent 47, gordon freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at id. whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do.<br /><br />even with its old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, games now border on the "experience level") and highly rectangular levels, the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun. especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them.<br /><br />also: "halt!" *bang! bang! bang!* "aarrrgh!!!" never grows old. --- 8/10<br /><br />voluntarily rated pc-13 for "profound carnage." however, it's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today.
