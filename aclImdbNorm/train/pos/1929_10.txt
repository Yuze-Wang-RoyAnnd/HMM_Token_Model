i recently had the pleasure of seeing the big bad swim at the ft. lauderdale film festival and i must say it is the best film i have seen all year and the only film i have ever felt inspired to write a comment/review on. this film was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogs, excellent acting, and an inspiring message. ordinary lives come together in an adult swim class and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life. this is poignantly illustrated by the imagery in the first minute of this captivating film where we see only the legs and torso of individuals in various shapes and sizes enter into a pool of water. this film is brilliantly directed as the actors are placed and positioned in captivating scenes, which hold your attention and imagination.
