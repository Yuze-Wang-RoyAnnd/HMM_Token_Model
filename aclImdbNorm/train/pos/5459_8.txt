baby face is a fast paced, wise cracking, knowing smirk of a film that<br /><br />lasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a smart 75 minutes they<br /><br />are! that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a<br /><br />short time puts most of today's movie makers to shame. screenwriters of<br /><br />today should study the economy of baby face and cut the bloat that<br /><br />overwhelms so many of their films. <br /><br />the story is no nonsense. an amoral woman rises to wealth first under,<br /><br />and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her.<br /><br />sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming, happy ending,<br /><br />but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted to<br /><br />go, so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest. stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and douglass dumbvrille as a<br /><br />hapless suitor. not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one. if<br /><br />you've never seen baby face catch it the next time it's shown on cable<br /><br />or rent the cassette. it's worth the effort..
