i recently found a copy for $5 at a video store, and snapped it up eagerly. while the music and (obviously) graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series, beyond the mind's eye, i am still entranced by one segment:<br /><br />stanley and stella in "breaking the ice". the music is brilliant, and the emotions feel real. the clip on odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, unfortunately.
