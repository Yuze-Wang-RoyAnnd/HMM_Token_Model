i loved this series when it was on kids wb, i didn't believe that there was a batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. first of all i loved the idea of robin leaving batman to solve crime on his own. it was an interesting perspective to their relationship. i also liked the addition of tim drake in the series, and once again like it's predecessor this show had great story lines, great animation (better then the original), fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing. the only thing that i didn't like was that was when it was in the us it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline. i just wish some of the episodes could be longer. my favorite episode of any batman cartoons comes in this series, and it's called "over the edge", in my opinion as good if not better then "heart of ice" and "robin's reckoning." overall a nice follow up, along with superman this show made my childhood very happy.
