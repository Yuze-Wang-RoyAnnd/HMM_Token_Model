most movies about, or set in, new orleans, turn out to be laughably bad, and laughably inaccurate (examble: remember "the savage bees"? but i'll make an exception for "tightrope", which almost got it right).<br /><br />here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong. the accents are not too bad (yes, the "yat" accent down here is way more brooklynese than southern), the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was, without the obligatory "tourist" shots, and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a "quirky southerner". <br /><br />one of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good film to boot..
