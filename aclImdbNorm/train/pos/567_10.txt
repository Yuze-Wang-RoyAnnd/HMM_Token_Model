jimmy stewart and anthony mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best.<br /><br />the real star of the film however is the spectacular canadian rockies that serve as a backdrop for the story. some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film.<br /><br />in all five of the westerns that stewart and mann did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast. no exception here, right down to parts that might only have a few lines, the characters are firmly etched with those lines.<br /><br />stewart is a cynical hard-bitten loner in this film whose only real friend is his sidekick walter brennan. it's brennan's death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the process.<br /><br />john mcintire is the head villain of the piece and he was an under-appreciated actor with a vast range. he could play delightful old codgers, authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain. <br /><br />one of the best westerns ever.
