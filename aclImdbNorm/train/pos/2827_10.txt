this is probably one of the worst movies ever made. it's...terrible. but it's so good! it's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you're going to be disappointed. however, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and goro's fantastic hair/bad english, you're in for a real treat. the harder you think about the film, the worse it gets, unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead. i'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard smap fans. and even then, the latter should be a bit careful, because goro's japanese fans were a bit upset about it, they thought he was selling himself out. (he wasn't really, not when johnny kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).
