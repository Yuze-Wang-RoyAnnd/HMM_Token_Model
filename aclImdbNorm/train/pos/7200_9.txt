deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn, every single turn, in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film, and it often doesn't make any sense, although they do usually catch you by surprise. the story is very good, except for the fact that it has so many twists. the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters, but you can't catch all the development because of the twists. the performances particularly by caine are amazing. the direction is very good, sidney lumet can direct. the visual effects are fair, but than again most are actually in a play and are fake. twists way to much, but still works and is worth watching.
