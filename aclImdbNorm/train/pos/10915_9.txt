rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia, for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man. they succeeded to some degree.<br /><br />a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles, bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role. so by this time he was pretty well set in the role. doctor bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as nick charles, but the basic blas'e nick is still there. one difference is that while nick charles married an heiress, doctor bradford works for a living as a physician. that helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film.<br /><br />he's got two murders to solve. a jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason. the trainer suspects something afoot, but he's bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet. this is after he comes to bill powell for help.<br /><br />myrna loy was a more steadying influence on bill powell than jean arthur was. arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than loy did. but it works here and she and powell have good chemistry.<br /><br />the ever dependable james gleason is the police inspector in the sam levene/nat pendleton role. all they needed here was asta and possibly eric blore as powell's butler was essaying that part.<br /><br />if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of bradford films.
