there's about 25 years worth of inspiration packed into it. beginning with existential themes of blade runner, as well as the vision of the future - with corporate billboards advertising their products, to the technology of the later matrix films and spielberg's a.i., and finally the black and white graphic novel look similar in style of sin city. the creators have put in a lot of effort in the visual department and the outcome is a well crafted future neo-noir. add a detective story and you've got an interesting film. i know what it wanted to be, but regardless of the stunning visuals, it wasn't enough to get it to the final destination.
