"cosby," in my opinion, is a must-see cbs hit! i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode, but i still enjoyed it. it's hard to say which one is my favorite. also, i really loved the theme song. if you ask me, even though i liked everyone, it would have been nice if madeline kahn hadn't passed away during the show's run. since that happened, i've always wondered what the show would have been like. everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, even though it can be seen on tbs now, i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
