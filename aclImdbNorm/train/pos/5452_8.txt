a pre-code stunner with stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore who sleeps her way to the top. these pre-code flicks really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination. stanwyck is outstanding as lilly the daughter of a speakeasy owner/father who sold more than booze to his patrons(johns).after the old man dies(good!) barb heads for the big city for better things.she uses her female attributes to sleep her way to the top. john wayne makes a poor "cameo" and proves that actors get better with age and an acting coach. i loved the banter and strong lines between the actors. i highly recommend this film to all film buffs and to watch stanwyck who is great and beautiful as lilly.
