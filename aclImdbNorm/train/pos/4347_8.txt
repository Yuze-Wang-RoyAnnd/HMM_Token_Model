i won't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground.<br /><br />just wanted to say that i really enjoyed the film very much. peter falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film.<br /><br />a small scale 'road trip' movie with falk & paul reiser in upstate ny in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film.<br /><br />very well written with an adult target audience in mind. plenty of reality based humor & some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family.<br /><br />really can't say enough about this film except that it's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesn't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does.<br /><br />it's great to see falk with a big leading man role again & he makes the most of it. it proves that his famous friend & writer/director john casavettes was right in casting falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s & 70s.
