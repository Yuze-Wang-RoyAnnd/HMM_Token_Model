ok, so soldier isn't deep and meaningful like blade runner or as big budget as terminator 2 but on the whole i found it quite enjoyable.<br /><br />the fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant. i found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than arnie's in the t films (and before i get comments yes i know that arnie was a cyborg and kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same).<br /><br />so to the film itself, a reasonable us/brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. not really sure if gary busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether i liked them or not. the colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other.<br /><br />kurt russell is good and unlike other comments i do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe escape from la - sequels are such fickle creatures!). sean pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble sci-fi lineage. and the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly.<br /><br />if you see this on your tv schedule i would recommend giving it a chance. i don't think you will be disappointed.
