little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for. even though their house was filthy, this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness. on the message board a poster wrote that "little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old." this reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version, big edie says to little edie, "if you're stuck, it's only with yourself!" these women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and actions. perhaps if little edie wasn't so hard on herself the first time things didn't work out, losing her hair, her job, and the love of her life, she would have made it. this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness: her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead. the world will never know what have happened if she didn't listen to her mom's plea, "come home, edie! let me take care of you!"<br /><br />yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant, heartbreaking, and lovable, even in their extremely filthy home. these women were extraordinary, and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness. when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns, dwelling about what could have been, or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl, one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that "everything will be okay!" <br /><br />great documentary!!<br /><br />9/10
