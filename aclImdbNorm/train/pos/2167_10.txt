i saw this movie back in 1984, we first started watching "this is spinal tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. so we went instead to see this movie. if you have any conspiracy theory's going around in your head, you will want to watch this one. <br /><br />the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are: do you think the government would be capable of doing this? (in my opinion there is no doubt that they could) <br /><br />but i don't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourself.<br /><br />but, just to let you know, we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do.
