screened at the san francisco international film festival under the title ' come undone', april 25, 26, & 27, 2001. the cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling. even with fall/winter backgrounds for the 'present' and spring summer for the 'flashbacks' there can be some difficulty following the continuity.<br /><br />whether either lead is gay, the actors well-portray the budding relationship in real life terms; from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking. the story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning. but as the end approaches, you really care about where these guys will be next summer! you, too, will want a sequel to find out.
