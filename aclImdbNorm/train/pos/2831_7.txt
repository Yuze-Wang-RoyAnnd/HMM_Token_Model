i stumbled onto this movie when i was ebay'ing caesars palace stuff, as i'm enamoured with its rich vegas history as the last of the original luxury resorts still standing in good condition (unless you count bally's, the original mgm grand). in that respect, this movie delivers full-force. you're given a grand tour of the caesars property,which in spite of all the renovations and additions they've done over the 40 years it's been open, looks alarmingly similar. as a film overall, the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, thanks in large part to the horrendous editing. and when i say horrendous, i'm not using that word lightly. there's a lot of spliced-in, second-long snippets of vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene where the robert drivas character is having a conversation with his father about how much he's grown up, and without any explanation, he (drivas) goes (in those infamous snippets) from being himself, to a baby, to a little boy, and then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father. (that doesn't give away any plot details; if anything, one can be prepared for it and maybe they won't be as flabbergasted as i was by the editing.) the film has aged well otherwise, and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son that most guys could relate to in some form or fashion.
