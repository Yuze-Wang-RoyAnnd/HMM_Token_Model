i saw this movie in the theater, and was thoroughly impressed by it. then again, that was when claire danes was a good actress, not the foolish, arrogant, hollywood-ized bitch she is today. anyway, this film really struck me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful friendship films. how far would you really go for your best friend? i was moved to tears at the end, and still tear up when i watch it now (i own it). i remember as soon as i left the theater, i called my best friend and sobbed to her how much i loved her. this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend. however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you'd do something like that for her....
