in a word...amazing.<br /><br />i initially was not too keen to watch pinjar since i thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards india and pakistan. i was so totally wrong. pinjar is a heart-wrenching, emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws. i was haunted by it after watching it. it lingered on my mind for so long; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion- all was so real.<br /><br />this is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowadays. it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story. here, no one country is depicted as good or bad. there are evil indians, evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis. the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to gulzar sahib) and haunting. everything about the movie was amazing...and the acting just took my breath away. all were perfectly cast.<br /><br />if you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie...look no further. this movie gives it all. i recommend it with all my heart. amazing cannot describe how excellent it is.
