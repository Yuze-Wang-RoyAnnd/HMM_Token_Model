along with "brothers & sisters", "six degrees" was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006. <br /><br />great cast all around, but really enjoyed the work of campbell scott (the come-back photog) and hope davis (recent widow of journalist killed in iraq).<br /><br />aside from the acting, the writing was fresh and the acting superb. the show was also shot in nyc, the real city, not the warner bros. or some other studio's backlot, adding a secondary layer or realism. <br /><br />i guess people are more interested in the latest "survivor" and other reality garbage. too bad it didn't last.
