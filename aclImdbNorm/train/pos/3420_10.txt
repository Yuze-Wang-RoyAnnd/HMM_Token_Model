this movie is a must-see movie for all. congress should see this truthful documentary from the point-of-view of the soldier, as should everyone in america. the previous reviewer totally missed the point--the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists, but who just live in our "enemy's" territory, and what it does to the soldiers. we must support our troops by bringing them home immediately, before another person is killed or injured. this also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are injured mentally, with ptsd- post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with lost limbs. julie a. roberts, streamwood, il
