is it a good idea to use live animals for department store window displays?<br /><br />no, and here's why....<br /><br />in "hare conditioned" the sale that bugs is helping promote is over and the store manager (nelson) is transferring him to a new department: taxidermy. naturally, bugs objects and the fun begins.<br /><br />using nearly every department in the store (children's wear, sports, shoes, costumes, women's nightgowns - don't ask.), bugs comes out on top at every turn, even referring to the manager as "the great gildersneeze". even when trapped in the confines of an elevator, bugs makes the best of the situation.<br /><br />director jones is on top of his pictorial game as always, as are blanc (as bugs, natch) and nelson (the manager - who does sound like radio mainstay gildersleeves - go ask your grand-parents).<br /><br />and a sage word of advice: when confronted by a fuzzy-looking woman wanting to try on bathroom slippers, always check her ears.<br /><br />ten stars for "hare conditioner", the best argument yet for animal labor laws.
