the ramones, whom i consider the founders of modern punk rock, lend their then-unique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan (p.j. soles) who faces off against a merciless, joyless principal (mary woronov) for the right to rock.<br /><br />featuring a soundtrack brimming with incredible music, rrhs is fascinating in concept and execution. it's chock full of riotous sight gags (like the mouse experiment), teenage spirit (probably my all-time favorite film opening), and bizarre, off-the-wall moments (the straitjacket scenes). if you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level, look no further. but if you're looking for a nice, dignified, dramatic epic, maybe you should look a wee bit further.<br /><br />"hi everybody, i'm riff randell, and this is rock & roll high school!"
