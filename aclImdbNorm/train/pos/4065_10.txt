i've seen the original english version on video. disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. i can't believe i'm saying that. the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own. the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film. the animation quality is excellent! if you've seen disney's job of kiki's delivery service you can see the quality in their production. it almost redeems them for stealing the story of kimba the white lion. (but not quite!) finally miyazaki's films are being released properly! i can't wait to see an uncut english version of nausicaa!
