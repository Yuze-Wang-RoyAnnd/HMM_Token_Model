it surprises me how much i love this movie despite the fact that i don't really like dogs. fox, field, and ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of chance, sassy and shadow, and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing.<br /><br />i have seen this movie 72 times already (i know that sounds scary, but it's true!), and every time the ending scenes still get me. i highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. it is indeed my all-time favorite movie!
