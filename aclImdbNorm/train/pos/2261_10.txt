i saw this movie, and the play, and i have to add that this was the most touching story that i had ever seen. until i saw this movie i was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the south african children and adults that were and are living in that era. it brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive, and to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing. this simply surpass a five star, i rate it a ten. thank you mr. mbongeni ngema for such a astonishing story. although it has been 12 years since this story has been told, it is still one that lays heavy in my heart.if there is a vhs, or dvd out there on the play, please notify me asap.thank you. ps there was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance.
