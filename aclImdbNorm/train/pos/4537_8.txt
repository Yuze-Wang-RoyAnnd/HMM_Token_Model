i saw the film for the first time at bbc on july the 27 of 2005. for me it was a good interpretation of the person conan doyle,and i truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it. i also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentioned.you may ask yourself was a.c. doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question. however he was the creator of the famous holmes,but how much of it was a sort of semi-biography? not the less i strongly put this adaption forward, it is a movie you have to see - even if you aren't interested in the sherlock holmes movies or books - look a it , enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it.
