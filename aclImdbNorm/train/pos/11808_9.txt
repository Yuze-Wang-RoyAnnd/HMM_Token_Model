at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the literate epic reds about the founding of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical john reed. it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast. at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup.<br /><br />that both reds and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player. in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay.<br /><br />the city's top mobster big boy caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition. the film opens with him rubbing out lips manlis's henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat. but caprice's moves are making him a target for tracy.<br /><br />in the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple caprice himself. will our hero sort out this thicket of crime?<br /><br />the spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious. when people like al pacino, dustin hoffman, paul sorvino, william forsythe, r.g. armstrong get themselves outrageously made-up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham, you've got to love this film.<br /><br />al pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor, but any of these guys could have, it's only that pacino as big boy caprice gets the most screen time. only beatty plays it completely straight, the others all seem to play off of him. dick tracy won oscars for best art&set design, best song written by stephen sondheim and introduced by madonna, sooner or later. the fact he was even able to get somebody like sondheim to write a score for this film only shows sondheim wanted to get in on the fun. as for madonna, the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer breathless mahoney.<br /><br />before this film, dick tracy movies were consigned to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials. the only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to vinyl. can you believe a cast like bing crosby, bob hope, frank sinatra, dinah shore, jimmy durante, judy garland, frank morgan, and the andrews sisters? try and find a recording of that gem.<br /><br />until then warren beatty's classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely.
