i'm glad that users (as of this date) who liked this movie are now coming forward. i don't understand the people who didn't like this movie - it seems like they were expecting a serious (?!?!?) treatment! c'mon, how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously? the filmmakers knew this was a silly premise, and they didn't try to deny it. the straight-faced delivery of scenes actually makes it funny! yes, there are times where the low budget shows (such as that explosion scene), but i think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie! so if you like b-movies, and the goofy premise appeals to you, then you'll certainly like "jack frost".
