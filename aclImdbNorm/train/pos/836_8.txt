this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. however we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. brosnan is excellent in this role, gone is the wooden james bond (a role he was wasted in). if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies. greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan's straight man. i've read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within. there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing. my father (a consultant) nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a "facilitator". much like "grosse pointe blank", another hit-man comedy, the humour can be very dark. if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself.
