i just saw "behind bedroom doors," and this was the first softcore flick with a solid story behind it that i've seen in a while.<br /><br />we begin with two neighborly couples--vivian and james fenway (julia kruis and eric carrington), and lillian and gabe harris (nicole sheridan and chris gustafson). vivian appears to be a housewife, james is a lawyer running for district attorney, lillian works in real estate, and gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. got all that? now, let's get into it.<br /><br />enter abby, played beautifully by porn star chelsea blue. she's renting the house across the street from the fenways and lives all by herself. at the beginning of the movie, james looks out his window and sees abby engaged in playtime with her girlfriend, gigi (played by prolific pornstress monique alexander) and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her. the next day, abby gets acquainted with all four of them, and appears to be a nice woman who just happens to be living an alternative lifestyle. she makes a pass at vivian, who seems startled and says to her, "oh...i'm...not that way." everything seems okay...until the plan gets set in motion<br /><br />first, abby shows up at gabe's office, naked, asking gabe if she should get a boob job. this is where we get our quote of the movie:<br /><br />"tell me about gabe." "what do you want to know?" "is gabe happily married?" "i'm married." "there's trouble.....let me guess. your wife stays at home, and does everything you ask. but, she's a good girl." "yes." "she's not a bad girl?" "no." "does that door have a lock on it?"<br /><br />you know what happens next....abby gets it on with gabe, right there in the exam room. after that, she puts on a little show in her window for james, who comes over and wastes no time in having sex with her. what james doesn't know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye is really a camera taping all the festivities (it's so obvious anyway). abby has sex with gabe again later, and this time gigi joins in to make it a three-way. now that abby has something on both men, she requests $100,000 from each in order to buy her silence. not only could she ruin james's run for office, but she could destroy gabe's practice.<br /><br />while gabe and james wrestle with their guilt, abby finds time to seduce lillian--who "experimented" with women in college. that was a long time ago, but you wouldn't know that seeing her in action with abby--she looked like an old pro.<br /><br />while gigi goes along with the plan, she's seems jealous of all the sex her girlfriend is having. "it's only business," abby says. confessions and apologies are sure to follow, as is some startling info on abby's true identity--it seems she's been doing the same thing to different men in many different places. gabe and james use this info to fight back against abby's blackmail.<br /><br />now, on to the sex. the sex scenes were pretty good, and considering all the women involved in this film except for julia kruis have a lengthy porn background, i wouldn't have expected anything less. nicole sheridan's four scenes were the best of the movie, with the three-way coming in a close second. monique alexander only got naked once, but she was a relatively minor character. julia kruis was a major character and got naked the same number of times. i suppose since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore pros, she didn't have to have as many sex scenes.<br /><br />to wrap up, "behind bedroom doors" had a great storyline, which enhanced the overall grade of the film. i consider it tapeworthy.<br /><br />women: a- (nicole sheridan was good in this film--better than her later offerings in fred olen ray's comedies. at least she can do drama somewhat. chelsea blue was a scene stealer--she wasn't that bad as the antagonist. i'd give her an a all by herself. julia kruis was her usual self. i wish monique alexander had more face time in this film, though.)<br /><br />sex: b (solid, very solid sex scenes. nicole sheridan's performances were almost hardcore quality. chelsea blue looked good in her scenes, too. the two girl-girl offerings weren't scorching, but they did warm up the screen.)<br /><br />story: b+ (i liked the dialogue and the main storyline. chelsea blue's performance was good for the genre, and i was impressed with nicole sheridan's turn at drama.)<br /><br />overall: b (this was a nice softcore flick. i'm glad i was able to watch this one, as i was pleasantly surprised. if chelsea blue ever wanted to do more of these, she'd be welcome anytime. that goes for nicole sheridan, too--even though she's probably better at doing comedy. i don't mind hardcore girls who can act doing softcore films.)
