this sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting, incredible photography, good story. it is often compared to "braveheart" because both movies take place in historical scotland. even though i love braveheart, i think this is the better of the two films. jessica lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an oscar). liam neeson is fantastic in the title role. tim roth plays one of the most evil, despicable, characters in film history (he was nominated for an oscar). john hurt is excellent as lord montrose, another dislikeable character. i am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that john hurt can play. this is a story of a dispute over money between rob roy and his clan, and lord montrose. rob roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with montrose if it violates his sense of honor. montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. and that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. this movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. it has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. one of my favorite films.
