this recreation of the infamous 1959 murders in kansas, based on the capote book, is starkly filmed by brooks and cinematographer hall in black and white, giving it a documentary feel. there are good performances from blake and wilson as the killers and forsythe as a cop who pursues them. the scenes leading up to the murders, filmed at the actual house where the crime occurred, with a soundtrack of whistling winds, are quite intense and chilling. brooks directs with a lot of verve and uses several interesting transitions between scenes. the only complaint is that it is a bit overlong, with the denouement dragged out and somewhat preachy.
