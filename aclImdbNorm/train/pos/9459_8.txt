i watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, for romantic comedies feature age old clich'es which make a movie uninteresting. typically in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever. but, this movie is a different story, it is really very different from the romantic comedies i have seen of lately. <br /><br />there is a widowed guy(dan), there is a girl(marie). dan meets marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime marie has to leave. dan develops something for her, and when this something starts to turn meaningful, we get a twist. marie is the girlfriend of his brother. unheeded of the circumstances, dan flirts with marie and realizes that he loves her, and even marie loves him, but their love would not just be possible. how it is made possible forms the rest of the story. <br /><br />steve carell performs well, juliette binoche is good as marie. and every other stuff is done well. it is a good movie, watch it.
