peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films, and they all laughed is one of his best. the cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy. interestingly enough, the witty, light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. fresh and immediate, the film starts with absolutely no explanation. there's no soundtrack music to cue us. we meet the characters in action, and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york, the film unfolds effortlessly. robby muller's camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental, but surely isn't. the cast is terrific. in every way, a classic.
