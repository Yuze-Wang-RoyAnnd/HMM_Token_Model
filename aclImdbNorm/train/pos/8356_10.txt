not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not, so beware:<br /><br />just a small but crucial thing to watch for, an intriguing possibility: the boys steal a green citroen at one point, for a joy ride, and return it to the owner having done purposeful and vengeful hidden damage to the car, hoping that the owner will crash. is it the very same car they steal much later from the picnicking family? we know the original owner sold it. they drive off at the end on a dangerous road, one which i understand has been closed to all but pedestrians for the last ten years. a whole new slant to the end of the film.<br /><br />on another matter, this film could have been called "scent of a woman". i don't recall another film, certainly not american, that treats the scent of a woman in such a frank and open manner, much like the "nose" of a fine bordeaux.
