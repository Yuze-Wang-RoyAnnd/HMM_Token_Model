i have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed: "a scanner darkly" and "immortel ad vitam". if you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy renaissance. it immerses you into the world of a future paris. it is not quite dystopian. they did the animation so well that i thought it was rotoscoped, but from what i can tell, it was not, it was merely motion capture. the facial expressions are amazing! not since tron have i seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation/live hybrid. the black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams, watch for it. the director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find. the overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises.<br /><br />the plot is secondary, but it isn't terrible. it is noir-ish. there is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth. there is weather. there are "sets" so you can feel like you are in different places in paris. there is some action, and even a car chase. i am going to have to see this one again to get everything. i also recommend a very large screen to view it as the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.
