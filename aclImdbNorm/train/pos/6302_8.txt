went to see this as me and my lady had little else to do on a sunday afternoon i like films that deal with sleazy,loser characters and this is full of em. after a slow start we get some good turns from the cast but it is the actual 'bellini' that both makes and lets the film down. the 'bellini' is one of the funniest scenes i have seen in a film for a long while but is too short and could have made this a masterpiece overall 71/2 out of 10
