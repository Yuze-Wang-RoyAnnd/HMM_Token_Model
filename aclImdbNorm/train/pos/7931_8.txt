man, if anyone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading that title, then you are a retard and you deserve to be disappointed. as for myself, i was expecting a low-budgeted cheeseball zombie flick- and that's exactly what i got. i wasn't disappointed at all. i thought it was a cool little movie. the zombies were exactly as they should be, because all of the zombies had just been turned, so they are freshly-undead zombies. obviously they did that because it would've been pretty costly if they had done full-on rotted zombie fx. i understood the whole thing, i have no idea how anyone could seriously nitpick this movie. it's called "hood of the living dead" for the love of god! would you watch "redneck zombies" and any uwe boll movie and actually expect it to be great? of course not! so why there are some morons on imdb whining like school girls about this movie, i'll never understand. oh and yes, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying that this was the worst you've ever seen, 'cause you know you're full of it! you ever watch "zombiez"???? or "feardotcom"????? or "house of the dead"???? those are some of the worst i've ever seen. if you can't see that it's just a low- budgeted zombie movie obviously made by zombie movie fans, then something's wrong with you. i just had fun with it. thumbs up from me and i'd also like to see a sequel.
