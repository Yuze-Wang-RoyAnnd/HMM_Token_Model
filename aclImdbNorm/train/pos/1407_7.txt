hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr. sebastian caine (kevin bacon) finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum. they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly, caine & his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human. he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible, however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible. the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works, caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory. but then again he's invisible right, he can do anything he wants...<br /><br />directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man. you know it's just after christmas, i saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick, not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief. the script by andrew w. marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man (1933) film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit. it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror, sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. i thought the character's were ok, i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it's generally known that verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety, the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that caine says to himself. then of course there's the gore, he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits, to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it. having said that i love horror/gore/exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me, it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.<br /><br />director verhoeven does a great job, or should that be the special effects boys make him look good. the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless, their brilliant & it's as simple & straight forward as that. there's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top. i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins, organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla. there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten, someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results.<br /><br />with a staggering budget of about $95,000,000 hollow man is technically faultless, i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they? the acting was ok, bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy.<br /><br />hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film, well i know i do. good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product, definitely worth a watch.
