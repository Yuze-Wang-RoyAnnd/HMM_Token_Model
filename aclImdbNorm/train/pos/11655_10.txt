there are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them. this film shows it as it is. it is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy, it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful. i've only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel. it is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop. this is what films should be about- they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong.
