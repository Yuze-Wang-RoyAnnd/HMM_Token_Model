today if someone mentions the name victor mclaglen the response most likely will be "who?" or perhaps "why?" well, believe it or not, victor mclaglen won the academy award for best actor in this film, which is about a poor, desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for "carfare" to the united states. it's an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well-meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks. the movie takes place in british-dominated ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of ireland, all mr. mclaglen's character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk. the movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point, many others not only do not care, they don't even know what the fuss is all about. the morale of this movie is: look out for the friend, he may sell you out for a dime.
