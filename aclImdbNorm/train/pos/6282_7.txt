nick cage is randall raines, a retired car thief who is forced out of retirement when he's forced to save his the life of his brother kip (giovanni ribisi) when he screws up on a job, by completing his brothers job of stealing 50 cars in one night. he has to get together his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it off and get his bro out of dutch. but the cops are onto him, so can he pull it off? this was one of the great candidates of a film to re-make as the original was far from a classic. and if you don't go into it expecting much, and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is. you'll end up enjoying the ride. watch it on a double-bill with "the fast and the furious" for a night of high-speed hijinks, just don't take the car out for a spin right afterwards.<br /><br />my grade: b- <br /><br />dvd extras: 7 minute jerry bruckheimer interview; bruckheimer bio/filmography; action overload: highlight reel; the big chase; "0 to 60" featurette; "wild rides" featurette; stars on the move; the cult "painted on the heart" music video; theatrical trailer, and trailers for "shanghai noon", "mission to mars" and "coyote ugly"
