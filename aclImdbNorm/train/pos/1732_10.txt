"sandra, the making of a woman" is a standout among exploitation films, and is so for two reasons: (1) an excellent, yet effortless, performance by monica gayle, and (2) the fact that gary graver was at the helm of the project. these two talents, both of whom are quite underrated, make "sandra" a film that should be seen.<br /><br />another key element of the film's success is its realism -- there is nothing fake or "hollywood" about this set-in-california film. it is truly a slice of life. the modest house in which sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses worn by the character, the scene where sandra wakes up in the morning to find uschi digart bouncing at her front door, and sandra sits on the couch without make-up, while digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, looking truly as if she just woke up (but nevertheless beautiful), the harmless weirdo sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra, the one-room apartment into which sandra moves --all of these elements of the film seem totally real, and as such, the viewer is drawn into sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class.<br /><br />this film could have easily failed in less competent hands, and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions, but the garver/gale team see to it that "sandra" is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film.
