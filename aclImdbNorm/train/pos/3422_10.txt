i desperately need this on a tape, not a dvd, and soon!<br /><br />i have one nephew who is in the infantry but has not yet deployed, although he set to go to iraq soon after december 2008. i lost my beloved step son in ramadi iraq on 09-15-05 from an unmanned missile in a green zone. i have another nephew who is joining the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because he, like his older brother, has some idealized and romanticized idea about what serving in the military is. my stepson died after only 10 days in country and he never went out on any missions so my nephews have no way to reference any of the experiences shown in this candid documentary from any type of personal experiences that might have been conveyed by my now deceased son. <br /><br />there is nothing i can do about those who are in, or now gone, but i have one left that has not raised his hand and been sworn in yet. i desperately want him to do so informed, none of the others did.<br /><br />pleases help me with this.<br /><br />the movie documentary the ground truth is the best visual reference i have ever seen. i need to somehow make my youngest nephew see what he is getting himself into before it is to late. but: ( do not laugh )i need my mother to see this first. she must actually see and hear these men and women, not simply the idea of them, but the truth of what they will be immersed in, possibly forever. then she will have the emotional determination to make my brother watch this film and once he has then he may then make his son, my youngest nephew, watch it too. then, my nephew might begin to take this seriously. <br /><br />((( is there another time when this will be shown on tv ? if so please tell me when ? )))<br /><br />however, my problem is, my mother does not own a dvd player, she still uses video ( is that correct? with tapes ? ) so, i need to find a way for her to be able to watch this film. can i purchase this from anyone in that form? if not, is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a tape from anyone? is there any legitimate link from which i can pay to download it onto my computer and then transfer it to a tape. if so who would i contact. i will gladly pay for the privilege providing it is a legitimate link. <br /><br />or,if you have any alternative ideas i will consider anything you can suggest.<br /><br />please help me, i have lost one very precious adored and loved one already, i already know my oldest nephew will never be the same when he returns and i may loose him too. i cannot loose three and the emotional toll for all of those that do make it back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation. please help me. i will happily call you, email me a number if that is the best way to get the needed information. thank you so much for any help you can offer.<br /><br />sincerely, lori swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
