probably the most whimsical installment of the first season, 'shore leave' has its ups and downs; some parts drag on too long and others are unambitiously cut short, but one can't deny they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode. kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation and so on. it appears for all intents and purposes to be an uninhabited earth, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. the first indication that things might go just a little awry is when mccoy, leading an advance team, spots alice (from wonderland) following a large white rabbit wearing a vest. kirk beams down and finds the others reporting similarly bizarre happenings and encounters. the one thing they all have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person/place/thing they discovered right before they discovered it. this doesn't immediately sink in with kirk or anyone else. more strangeness ensues, including sightings of don juan, a siberian tiger, a ww2 fighter plane, etc; kirk meets up with ruth, a gorgeous old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from his academy days, finnegan. the chase/fight scene with finnegan goes on too long but at the same time, mccoy is run through with a lance by a knight on horseback and apparently killed. finally, an elderly man appears and explains what has been happening. the planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have only to imagine something to have it appear. nothing is permanent; mccoy isn't really dead. once this is explained, kirk decides to order shore leave for everyone after all. despite the 'it was all a dream' sort of ending, 'shore leave' holds up as another first-rate episode of star trek's first season.
