larry fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum. well, the worst mistake, evidently, is the marketing of the movie and the way the dvd might have been targeted. obviously, this is not a true horror movie, at least, not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying. <br /><br />"wendigo" is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young miles. things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend. it is obvious that kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son. this is also a story of alienation. it's clear that the father, george, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in a different world.<br /><br />miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country. that part of new york state, with its winter landscape, barren trees, play havoc on the little boy's imagination. it doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town, it creates even more doubts in his young mind. ultimately, miles' world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything, even evoking the wendigo spirit.<br /><br />the film is well paced and acted. patricia clarkson is excellent, no matter where movie she is in. jake weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand. erik per sullivan, as miles, conveys the inner turmoil within him. i thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is miles own take on what's going on around him. finally, john spredakos is perfect as the menacing otis, a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out.<br /><br />instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with a open mind.
