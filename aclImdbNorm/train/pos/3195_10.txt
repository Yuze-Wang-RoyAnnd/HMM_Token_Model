the beaver trilogy is, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant films ever made. i was lucky enough to catch it, along with a q&a session with director trent harris, at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of trent's website. this movie has to be seen to be believed! i sincerely recommend searching for trent's name on the web and then buying the film from his site. he's an incredibly nice guy to boot. don't get confused: the cameraman in the fictional sections of the beaver trilogy is not trent!<br /><br />after having seen the trilogy a few times, i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version. it's like a try-out version for the crispin glover "orkly kid" section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you're a penn fan than it being a good video. penn is pretty funny, though, and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty b&w video.<br /><br />this is probably also one of crispin glover's best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original groovin' gary. once you see this film, you'll never get gary's nervous laughter out of your head ever again.
