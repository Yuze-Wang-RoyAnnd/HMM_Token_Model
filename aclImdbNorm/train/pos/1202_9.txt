i really enjoyed this documentary about kenny and spencer's attempt to pitch "the dawn". was a great look at how outsiders try to get to the inside to make it big. <br /><br />the story was put together well and organized in an interesting manner that made the film flow well. certainly worth a watch. my only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure. perhaps that is part of the point. we expect it but in reality that is not what happened (or usually happens).<br /><br />the film is also a great way to see the personality of kenny and spencer outside of their canadian television show. you can see a bit of what is yet to come. <br /><br />i look forward to a chance to see the papal chase.
