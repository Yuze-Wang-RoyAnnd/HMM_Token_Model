49. paperhouse (thriller/horror, 1988) sick in bed with a fever 11-year old anna (charlotte burke) has only her drawings to keep her company. her health progressively worsens as a series of mysterious 'black outs' grip her. in each of these episodes she dreams of a house in a desolate field, with only a sickly-invalid boy named marc (elliot spiers) inhabiting it. when a dark, unknown danger threatens her idyllic "paperhouse", the life of marc is put in jeopardy. her life is also in danger as these dreams mirror her own state of health.<br /><br />critique: haunting first debut feature from british director bernard rose. taken from a fable ("marianne dreams") by catherine storr, it leaves plenty of other 'original' fantasy works in its wake. whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares it is hard to give it the mixture of fable and reality to make it work in film form. director rose successfully captures the children fantasy world aspect along with a darkness that seeks to usurp them.<br /><br />feverishly scored by phillip glass, rose knows how to use music wisely with expertly timed 'jump out of your seat' moments. most thrillers are very sloppy in this all-important aspect of scaring the audience into not knowing what the next scene will bring. i also like the way he captures suspense and never lets it go or falter sluggishly into the next sequence of events. also, his mastery of placing objects within the frame (as in his p.o.v.shots) gives the cinematography an added dimension it would otherwise seem to lack. only in europe will you find such ominous looking places as the ones presented here: the lonely house, the fields, coastal towns, watchtower etc. <br /><br />rose would follow this film with "candyman" (1992), a true 'thinking person's' horror gem and bona fide cult horror favorite.
