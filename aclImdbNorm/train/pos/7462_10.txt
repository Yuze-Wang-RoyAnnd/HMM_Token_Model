note: these comments are for people who have seen the movie.<br /><br />vanilla sky is a brilliant, complex, and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag-line says: lovehatedreamslifeworkplayfriends. maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie-goers if one looks at it from a different angle.<br /><br />considering the following:<br /><br />now, i have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene, so i will have to further examine my assertions, (and i welcome your thoughts) but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place: where exactly does the debatable 'splice' occur?<br /><br />now, i'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the l.e. 'technician', since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of david aames's mind/dream/coma state, but the true splice between reality and dream.<br /><br />it seems to me that the reality of the car crash, the way that it is filmed (no explosion, for example) is a likely 'splice' point, and that any particular sequence containing an existential/dream/coma/non-reality feel to it -- whether it's shown onscreen before or after the crash -- is actually a part of aames' personal journey toward self-realization inside of his own mind.<br /><br />in that respect, then, we are left with two questions at the very end(if you know of more, let me know): is aames actually disfigured, and where does he wake up?<br /><br />if you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop-culture society.<br /><br />
