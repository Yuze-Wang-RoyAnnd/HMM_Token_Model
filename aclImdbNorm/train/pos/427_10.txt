one of the best ensemble acted films i've ever seen. there isn't much to the plot, but the acting- incredible. you see the characters change ever so subtly, undr the influence of the rented villa in italy, and love. and happiness. the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you, much as the villa does on all the women. truly "enchanted".
