despite what others had said (*cough*), this is my favourite movie of all time. i don't know how long i had been waiting to see it, but once i finally did, i immediately fell in love. sure, it's strange, but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour. for those who don't know, moonchild is one of gackt and hyde's first movies. they haven't done very many at all, maybe 3 or 4 tops each. so, give them some credit. we all know that adam sandler wasn't the best at first either. i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there, but i over look that to find the best points of this movie, the emotions displayed and whatnot. therefore, i have given, and always shall give, this movie a 10 out of 10.
