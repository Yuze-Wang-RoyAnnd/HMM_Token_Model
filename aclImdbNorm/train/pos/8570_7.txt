i noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on dodie smith's novel. in any case, it was a nice idea that pongo and perdita's son now had his own puppies. the cutest of the dalmatians was, of course, little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film. <br /><br />to be honest, i didn't know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind. in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly, but now that she so quickly changed into "herself" again and announced that she was cruella once more, i almost began to be really worried about chloe's dalmatians.<br /><br />actually, the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner, was much better than i had expected. i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog, and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /><br />of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again, but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property. and what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money?<br /><br />finally, it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film.
