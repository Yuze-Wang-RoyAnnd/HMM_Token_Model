i watched this movie every chance i got, back in the seventies when it came out on cable. it was my introduction to harlem, which has fascinated me (and bill clinton) ever since. i was still very young, and the movie made a big impression on me. it was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up, trying to decide whom they wanted to be, and making some bad choices as well as good ones. i was dazzled by lonette mckee's beauty, the great dresses they eventually got to wear, and the snappy dialogue. as someone being raised by a single mother as well, i could really identify with these girls and their lives. it's funny, these characters seem almost more real to me than beyonce knowles!
