i thought this movie did a down right good job. it wasn't as creative or original as the first, but who was expecting it to be. it was a whole lotta fun. the more i think about it the more i like it, and when it comes out on dvd i'm going to pay the money for it very proudly, every last cent. sharon stone is great, she always is, even if her movie is horrible(catwoman), but this movie isn't, this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime, and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs. don't wait for it to be a classic, watch it now and enjoy it. don't expect a masterpiece, or something thats gripping and soul touching, just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs.<br /><br />all in all, this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven't seen it see it, because what the critics and box office say doesn't always count, see it for yourself, you never know, you might just enjoy it. i tip my hat to this movie<br /><br />8/10
