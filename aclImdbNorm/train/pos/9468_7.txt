i saw a special advance screening of this today. i have to let you know, i'm not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell, so i really had no expectations going into this. i ended up enjoying it quite a bit.<br /><br />dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family. while at a bookstore, he meets the woman of his dreams, only to find out that she happens to be his brother's girlfriend.<br /><br />this movie is pretty well made- the soundtrack, cinematography, and acting are all top-notch, especially steve carell. my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development, mostly with dane cook's character. we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steve's characters, and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dan's inner conflict about being in love with dane's girlfriend was like. other than this though, dan in real life is definitely a solid, sweet film- definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've been getting this year.
