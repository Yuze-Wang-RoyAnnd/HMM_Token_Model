a great 90's flick! parker posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in manhattan that requires so much cash. posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler. this is a good, light movie for saturday night before you go out. the soundtrack rocks, the outfits are out of this world, the script is funny and the actors do a great job. the redeeming value : you can make it in this world if you try, just find your niche. i believe parker posey is the perfect actress for this kind of character: young, fabulous and broke. (you must look up the movie "clockwatchers" ). if you watch party girl you are bound to have a good time. enjoy!
