...........as i was when i saw this movie) i will never watch this movie again, not because it is a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! as i said, i was 14 when my english teacher decided to show it to us; the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book.<br /><br />all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over kidd's bed, although, just before that there is something that also frightened us, which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow, and he hears a child's voice say "it's for you". that scene still haunts me to this day, nearly 7 years after i saw the film.<br /><br />if you are easily scared, avoid this film!!!!!!!!
