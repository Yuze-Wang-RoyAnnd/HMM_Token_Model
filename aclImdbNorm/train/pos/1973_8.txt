i never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film. that goes for critics as well. sure, if it gets positive reviews that's ok and a plus, but most films that get critical rave i hate. i enjoyed this film for what it was, an entertaining film. it takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional character...that being catherine trammell. sharon stone is awesome in this role, just like she was in the first one. anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one b/c she is back acting the same way she did in basic instinct 1. catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection. her one liners are great, much like in the first one. who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops, "if you're gonna arrest me do it...otherwise get the f**k out of here!" great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this one. i was captivated by her. her outfits, the way she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, its worth the price just to see stone's performance. i cannot wait for this film to be released on dvd, uncut, because i can only imagine how much better it is going to be. and yes, there are lots of twists, as in the first one, including the ending!
