in the same tune as his americana drums along the mohawk, john ford captures american history in a way that is fictional yet very believable. henry fonda made three consecutive films in this era with ford and all three are about a certain time and place with emphasis on the setting and the cultural surroundings. in mohawk, pioneer america is in full bloom with americans fending for themselves against indians and other forces. here, ford shows us 19th century america; a time when invention and creativity were beginning to blossom and this nation truly was becoming great. amongst it all was a tall, lanky, young lawyer from illinois named abe lincoln and this film fictionalizes his life as a lawyer, foreshadowing the greatness he would later accomplish.<br /><br />fonda is superb in this movie, capturing the essence of what is considered to be the persona of lincoln, although no one knows exactly what he was like then. the sets and supporting cast also work well together and give a unique balance in ford's picturesque of the american dream and its many forms. this is not a film to be taken literally but rather symbolically, showing that lincoln was indeed warming up for the events in his life that were to creates his legacy. we even get some scenes between him and a young mary todd; and it is hard to see how they did end up together but that is not the point. i believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest american president. his quiet and straightforward demeanor was rare then and would be today. indeed, our government surely needs more men like him.
