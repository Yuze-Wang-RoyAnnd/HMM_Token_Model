after seeing this film for the 3rd time now i think it is almost adam's worst film punch drunk love is poor in comparison to this i must say at the end when dickie gets thrown of the boat it is so funny (the hair is different to his and i like it when he flips everyone off. this film should only be brought if your a true adam sandler fan.<br /><br />the characters are poor in comparison to his funny films like the waterboy, which has the same people in it (peter dante) who is one of the assassins trying to kill the australian bird.<br /><br />this film lack depth and a decent story line and deserves to be in the bottom 100
