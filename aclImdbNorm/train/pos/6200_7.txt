henry fool is a better film. but this is the perfect way to follow-up a film like 'henry fool.' to take henry very seriously, his 'lies' and his mysterious aura. even the opening shot of 'henry fool' when simon puts his ear to the ground as henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifest through 'fay grim.' the over-the-top jokes, that are more or less meta-jokes (about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves), are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them. also hartley's use of dutch angles throughout the film is jarring, yes, it's intention, but it feels forced and over-used, it goes beyond jarring to, what i'd like to call, annoying. it's a flawed film, but a must see for any hartley or 'henry fool' fan. <br /><br />and don't listen to stupid reviews, don't watch this unless you've seen the first film. the intrigue, satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you haven't seen henry fool. it's a sequel. that's just dumb.
