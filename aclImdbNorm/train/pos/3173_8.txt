an imagination is a terrible thing to waste ... especially when you have talented actors. writer/director jones wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist. <br /><br />anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter. anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will just plain cry. we've all wanted to rip a terrible toupee off a man's head. these are only snippets of what's in store when watching "cross eyed", a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for jones and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera.
