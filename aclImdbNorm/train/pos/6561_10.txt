honestly, this is the best reality show anyone has ever come up with. in order to win the money you have to actually be intelligent. not only that you've got to be brave, athletic, cunning, etc. it actually requires skill. not like some lame-ass shows that are on these days. and yet, they only have two seasons of it! bull..they need to bring this show back!! <br /><br />although, they'll have a hard time pulling anderson cooper away from cnn. he was great.<br /><br />but seriously, it was an amazing show. you never knew who would be going when. and it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself! it was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to!<br /><br />bring back the mole!!!! bring back the mole!!!!
