i remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 & loved it then. about 4 years later i had the privilege of seeing luciano pavarotti sing at the metropolitan opera house in new york (in tosca) so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night. what's not to like about this film? the music is brilliant and pavarotti (fini) was at his best and still looked great. the story is actually very funny in parts & the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest i have ever seen. the hot air balloon flight over the napa valley was beautiful & so was the song he sang "if we were in love" (one of the few times pavarotti sang in english). and hearing the duet of santa lucia gorgeous. get real folks, this was a film about an opera singer called georgio fini who just happened to be played by pavarotti. kathryn harrold & eddie albert were excellent in their supporting roles.<br /><br />i am very glad that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie but i would love this to be released on dvd especially now that pavarotti is no longer with us because i think this includes the best performance of nessun dorma sung by him still on film today!
