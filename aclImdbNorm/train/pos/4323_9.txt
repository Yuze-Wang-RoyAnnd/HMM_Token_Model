this is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right. the plot cutdowns might disappoint the fans of the book (but really how many modern readers have read bleak house without seeing a film version first? i know of only a few). <br /><br />i think it is quite appalling to see reviews critical of the series which have clearly been written by people who haven't a clue about the story - did you actually see the series or did you just bag a bbc production because gillian anderson was in the newer version?<br /><br />the series captures the mood, pace, characters and plot-drivers (cutting out the dickensian flourishes which aren't needed and detract from a film treatment like the turveydrop story, the smallweed family dynamic and the extra lawyers - tangle, vholes etc are very truncated). the only omission that i wish had been kept was the jellyby incident but as the first episode is already a trifle slow (after the first episode the pace is perfect) i can see it had to go. <br /><br />the only other criticism i have is that jo's death could have been more faithfully done. i can see that would have practically canonized woodcourt and he's kept a little more human for not having that scene but really i think jo's death is one of the most poignant points of the book and i missed it even though it always makes me cry.<br /><br />has theowinthrop actually seen the series? how did he think that esther was raised by her aunt and uncle?? who is this uncle? i suppose someone who could mistake the name of denholm eliott for desmond isn't really an appreciator of english art (film or literature).<br /><br />i also think he mistakes the treatment of the law. yes the law is drawn very badly in bleak house. it fails the descendants of jarndyce whose valuable inheritance is eaten up by the costs of litigation, it fails the deceased tom jarndyce and rick carstone and all who have faith in the suit. it fails miss flyte. in some sense it also fails captain hawdon who is driven to his death by the monotony of law copyist work. yes it feeds the scavengers of vholes and tangle. but it also makes men like guppy and kenge able to move beyond their station in life. though not kind to social status-climbers dickens clearly would have preferred that they weren't bound to being stuck in the station to which they were born (contrast jo and the brickmakers' families to the climbing out of poverty by charley neckett). <br /><br />also, the law, while misused by tulkinghorn and the chancery vultures, is actually the source of security for the wards of the court ada and richard, and for esther who is simply jarndyce's ward. their security was ensured by the law which delivers them to jarndyce.<br /><br />i can't see how anyone could have trouble following the story - remember you aren't supposed to realize esther is lady dedlock's daughter right at the beginning. neither are you supposed to "get" all the connections immediately. instant gratification just doesn't happen in dickens.<br /><br />as for "seeing clearly" through the fog - gosh the gillian anderson had such scatty editing that i found it impossible to follow and i knew the plot already!<br /><br />i found diana rigg absolutely brilliant (overacting and drama don't make a good lady dedlock but if you think they do try the gillian anderson version).<br /><br />it's ada and rick not "kate"! and you get all you need of the rouncewell subplot.
