i had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater i was confronted by a camera crew from a local tv station looking for comments on the film. at the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were "awesome. just awesome." i like to think i can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time i was somewhat incapable of doing so.<br /><br />the story is intriguing and thought provoking, and the acting is first rate from all the principals. this film was the first one that terry gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. back with universal after his long, arduous battle with them over "brazil", terry had achieved what he wanted most; the "final cut". terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction. it is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements.<br /><br />the universal collector's edition dvd of this film is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box. it contains among other things, a director/producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called "the hamster factor and other tales of 12 monkeys". it tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking, including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly, striking the team with feelings of self-doubt and despair. fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success. <br /><br />
