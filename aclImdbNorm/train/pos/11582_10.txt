for someone who remembers jane in the daily mirror strip cartoon, viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia. in that context it is wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters. the plotline is also a bit limp for today's audience, but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well. jane, you must remember, was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years, created to boost the morale of the troops. she gave a double meaning to the "strip" in strip cartoon.<br /><br />the story has something in common with the tales of edgar rice burroughs and rider haggard. the theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era, a bunch of bumbling nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling englanders, and set in the african jungle of course.<br /><br />for jane fans, a must see. for the rest of you, a damp squib.<br /><br />
