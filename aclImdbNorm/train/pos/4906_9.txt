i don't believe this was an acting challenge for richard harris. this was an uncomplicated plot, yet interesting. it is a good movie to watch when you don't want to do a lot of thinking, just want to be told a simple story. the canadian scenery was breathtaking. the beautiful fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing.
