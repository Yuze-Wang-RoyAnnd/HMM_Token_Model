this is one of my favourite martial arts movies from hong kong. it is one of john woo's earliest films and one of only a few traditional martial arts movies he directed. you can see his influences from working under chang cheh in this film. the action is good, the fight choreography is conducted by fong hak on who appears as one of the bad guys in the movie. it stars wei pei of "five venoms" fame and a whole host of faces familiar to fans of golden harvest and shaw brothers productions. the story line is interesting, there are a few decent plot twists and the build up of the characters and their relationships with each other is cleverly done. this film has only had a vhs release in the uk. media asia have released a region 3 dvd and there are versions of it on dvd available from the usa. the film is lovely to watch in either it's original language or in it's english dubbed version. i highly recommend this movie.
