spoilers<br /><br />a buddy of mine said next movie was the best cheech & chong flick and went out of his way to have me borrow it and the blues brothers. next movie has no plot, has no pacing, really has no anything of what defines a movie ... but it is funny. and for what it is worth, cheech and chong show some heart.<br /><br />well, in this little paragraph i put in the plot, but being that four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that would usually start a story. i will just say that cheech 's cousin shows up.<br /><br />was there no other funnier moment when chong made cheech drink the pee twice? what about the rooster? was that pee-wee herman's first movie appearance? you would have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. i don't think next movie has strong enough balls to make it awesome, but the movie has heart and hey, my buddy let me borrow it so it gets a 7.
