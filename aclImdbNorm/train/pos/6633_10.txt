the first film ever made. workers streaming from a factory, some cycling, most walking, moving right or left. along with melies, the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifice, spectacle; with the lumieres pure, unadorned, observation. the truth. there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former.<br /><br />but consider this short again. there is nothing 'objective' about it. the film is full of action - a static, inhuman scene burst into life, activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured, decentred from the back to right or left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is). and yet the camera stands stock still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it.<br /><br />worse is the historical reality of the film. these factory workers are lumiere employees. the bosses are spying on their workers, the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions. the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. behind the gates, the workers are confined in their workplace. the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further confining them. the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance, an image of unseen, all-seeing authority entrapping its servants. a frightening, all too prophetic movie.
