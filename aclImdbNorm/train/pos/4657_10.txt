hot millions is a great movie in every way. a fun, offbeat story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the business. peter ustinov is brilliant, as usual, and maggie smith---definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time--- is a total delight. karl malden and bob newhart round out the cast and are also perfect. if you want a movie that has perfect casting, this is it. what is so impressive is the way these people work off each other in such a natural and effortless way, creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout. peter ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. the direction, photography, and editing are also first-rate, and it's a great time capsule of london in the '60s. it's definitely on my all-time favorites list.
