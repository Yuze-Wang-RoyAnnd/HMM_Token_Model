it follows block-heads and a chump at oxford, two films that are hard to top. not that saps at sea is a bad film - it is the last good comedy (unless one insists on jitterbugs or another of the later films) that laurel & hardy made. it's just that it is a toss-off little film, without the crazy destructive crescendo of block-heads or the astounding sight of stan's "real" personality in a chump at oxford to revel in. at 57 minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit, but that actually is not a bad point for it. it has just enough time to it to hit the right notes. it's just not as special as the other two.<br /><br />stan and ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns. i suspect that there was a bit of chaplin influence in this sequence (one recalls a similar assembly-line incident in modern times only four years earlier). ollie's nerves finally snap, and he goes on a rampage. he goes home and (naturally) his roommate stan does not help - stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument (you've got it - a trombone). after beating up the poor professor, ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor/engineer (ben turpin in a nice brief appearance), and then faces his doctor (jimmy finleyson) and his nerve tester (a balloon that inflates as you push air out of ollie's stomach). finleyson announces that it is a bad case of "horniphobia", and ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goat's milk. they end up going to a ship but ollie and stan know nothing about seamanship - so they plan to sleep on the ship. unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off. also unfortunately, on board is richard cramer, an escaped dangerous criminal. this is not going to be a peaceful vacation.<br /><br />saps at sea (like a chump) could have been three shorts, one at the factory, one at the apartment, and one on the boat. each would have been a successful short, and they all make a funny film - but the stitching of the parts together shows. there are some very amusing moments in the film - the discoveries of how turpin's ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and stoves in the apartment; the accidental remarks of building manager charlie hall when stan or ollie runs by him and asks for directions ("can you help me find the basement?" asks stan - "certainly,you can't miss it - it's downstairs!", says hall, who realizes what a stupid comment he just made); and cramer's mistreatment of his two hostage slaves. he calls ollie "dizzy" and stan "daffy" (an allusion to the dean brothers of the st. louis cardinal teams of the 1930s - see dan dailey's the pride of st. louis). cramer has the boys cook him up some food - and they make a synthetic meal (boot laces for spaghetti, for instance) to get him sick to be overpowered. when he realizes what they have done, he forces them to eat the meal themselves. their reactions are brilliant.<br /><br />saps at sea is not on par with the top line of laurel & hardy films, but it is a good film on the whole, and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career (1927 - 1940) when they were with hal roach. in the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and roach had serious problems involving production costs (our relations, where stan was producer on the film), artistic problems (scenes from swiss miss were cut meaninglessly), and contractual arguments (leading to ollie appearing with harry langdon in zenobia). stan and ollie hit back with the flying deuces, wherein the production was not roach's but boris morros'. at last a two picture deal of a chump at oxford and saps at sea concluded the arguments and problems - and on a high note the boys left roach. unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been.
