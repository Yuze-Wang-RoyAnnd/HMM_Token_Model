i went to see vanilla sky with a huge, huge, huge!!..tom cruise fan, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can i say .. i was totally blown away by the movie and especially tc's performance, i thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what i was expecting.<br /><br />i had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it, i am so pleased that i was 'coerced 'into seeing it. the strange thing is i cannot say why, all i can say is that i found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day. as to what i felt about the film, all i can say about is, its not the storyline (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever) its about the people and the events that shape their life and how small events, like getting into a car can change everything......<br /><br />as to what the critics wrote, yes maybe the original was a stunning 2nd film for alejandro amen'abar , but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject, and by no means a narcissistic remake for the benefit of tom cruise and penelope cruz.<br /><br />i cannot even consider writing a couple of trite, glib sentences to describe the film just go and see it!!!!<br /><br />yes i know this isn't a balanced thoughtful review but so what .it's not that kind of film.
