"once in the life" is a very good movie. however it's not good for everybody, due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations. the movie manages to represent in an anecdotic, believable way the "life" in nyc neighborhoods where drug problems are important. this depiction is in turn used as the decor for a most thoughtful and suspenseful drama backed up by powerful dialogs (however i had a hard time understanding some of them because english is not my mother tongue. on video it's ok). there is a little overplay sometimes, but i think it fits quite well to the general orientation fishburne gave to the movie, which gives matter for reflexion more than just being a good style exercise, notably in the time/action management. the characters, even though not simple, are easy to relate to and actors do a fine job at impersonating them. by the way i much enjoyed the soundtrack (b. marsalis). if you're not too prude, you should enjoy seeing that movie once, twice, three times. i rated the movie 9/10.
