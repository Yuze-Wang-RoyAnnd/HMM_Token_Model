this movie came and went in the theaters. due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn't well received. it was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself. higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america: racism.<br /><br />plot/story: higher learning is mostly centered around malik(played by omar epps), a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough, and a stern professor(played by laurence fishburne). he befriends fudge(ice cube) as well as a gorgeous lady named deja(tyra banks). later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus. remy(play by michael rapaport) is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus. once they impose their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are.<br /><br />opinion: higher learning is not without its flaws: character development is scarce, okay performances by omar epps, tyra banks and the leader of the skinheads(whose name i forgot), busta rhymes doesn't fit in this movie at all. plus women turning gay after being abused by men was clich'e' before this film so you know i didn't like that part of the film with kristy swanson. other than that, this movie wasn't half bad. laurence fishburne was good as professor phipps(even though i could do without the accent), fudge was ice cube's best performance and michael rapaport was good as the confused remy. all in all it was one of john singleton's best movies and is one is one of the reasons i frown on the rubbish he puts out now. cinema needs more movies like higher learning, mississippi burning and american history x and less movies like baby boy, 2 fast 2 furious and a very pointless remake of shaft.
