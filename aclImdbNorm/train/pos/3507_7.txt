"victor doesn't have much, but that's not stopping him from trying to go out with judy, the prettiest girl on the block. all he's got is hope and a one-bedroom apartment he shares with his family. his grandmother doesn't trust him, his brother worships him, and his half-sister just declared war. but victor thinks love really can conquer all in this warm, genuine, and touching romantic comedy about life in the part of the city most people never see," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />peter sollett' "raising victor vargas" elicits engaging "debut" performances from lead actor victor rasuk (as victor vargas) and the cast. mr. rasuk and juicy judy marte (as judy gonzalez) are sexy and endearing as "lower east side kids" discovering the joy of sexual attraction. considering how attractive they look in this picture, it's not hard to predict they hook up - and, although you may wonder how "innocent" they really are, their characterizations seem true.<br /><br />victor's brother "nino" is played by victor's real-life brother silvestre rasuk, who looks the part his older brother is playing. sometimes, it's nice to see movie brothers who actually look alike; and, hopefully they will work together again. "cuckoo for cocoa puffs" sister krystal rodriguez (as vicki) and old world altagracia guzman (as grandma) round out the sex-starved dominican immigrant family. so, are hand-held-camera coming-of-age films in vogue, or what? <br /><br />******* raising victor vargas (5/16/02) peter sollett ~ victor rasuk, july marte, silvestre rasuk
