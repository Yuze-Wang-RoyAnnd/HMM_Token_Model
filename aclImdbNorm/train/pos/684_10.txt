i grew up watching this series. i was about seven/eight years old when it was on. i still remember the 1st episode which was called "the new house." it scared the h*ll out of me! i can almost still hear that statue, laughing madly. and the ending, oh my god! the hooror spirit comes in the room for the child: yikes! this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series. i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. my question to any readers: has anyone purchased this set? its a bootleg. both sellers claim to have very good copy. i have a sketchy and poor dvd of "the new house" episode, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better,however, if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids. a great series, clever, scary and daringly supernatural. thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this- in fact, i'd love to discuss it. chris walker
