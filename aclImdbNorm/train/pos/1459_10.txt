wow! wow! wow! i have never seen a non-preachy documentary on globalization until i saw mardi gras: made in china. this film has zero narration and combines verite footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in china who live inside a factory compound. they play with toys, jump rope, and dance. yet, the majority of their days and nights consist of work, work, and work -- but the footage of their work is illuminating and mesmerizing to watch. the owner of the factory in china is amazingly open, so much so that he hits home the effects of globalization while he "punishes" the workers. astutely following mardi gras beads from china to the carnival, the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting, compelling footage from both cultures. one of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and mardi gras revelers to each other through pictures. here, the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. the film is never preachy, is not guilt driven, and allows everyone's point of view to be present. at the end, we -- the viewers -- make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film, and globalization.
