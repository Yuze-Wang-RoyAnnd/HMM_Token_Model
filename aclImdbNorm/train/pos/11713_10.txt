i think it took a lot of guts for her to come forward like that. it is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what helps people most. but, in her case, what she did was remarkable. i have been in the mental health field for five years and i think it is great that mental illness is not a terrible word anymore and i believe she helped. i always thought she was great and always will. i am glad that she wrote this book and that the movie was made. she is a remarkable lady and i hope she continues to act. she has been through a lot and has faced it. i would really love to see her work more with children, especially child actors. her ordeal should not have happened and i think she would be wonderful as a mentor to young people. the movie was so moving to me that i was very touched. suffering a tbi which brought the onset of my disorder and having ptsd, it is good to know that someone has the courage enough to display her life as she did. i believe it helped this nation and people in general realize that there are others like them and that there is help. thank you ms. duke, or anna, which ever you prefer.
