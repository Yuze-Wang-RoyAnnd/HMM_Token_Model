level one, horror.<br /><br />when i saw this film for the first time at 10, i knew it would give me nightmares. it did. surprisingly, as i recall, it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them.<br /><br />level two, psychoanalytic theory.<br /><br />later as an adult, i saw the story for what it was: what if the savage, unrestrained instincts we all repress became manifest.<br /><br />level three, pure science fiction.<br /><br />the best way plausibly to realize the plot's "what if" is through the science fiction genre. this is pure science fiction, not the "cowboys in space" that passes for the genre today.<br /><br />after 43 years, forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films. if planning a remake, skg or lucas, watch out!
