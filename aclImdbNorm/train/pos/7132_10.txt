a heartwarming film. the usual superb acting by john thaw, who passed over recently. a man who was always so unassuming. he was one of englands top 10 actors certainly of my time.<br /><br />he can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse. as jack regan in the 1970's hit tv series 'the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc. a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection. the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings. the interaction between the two main characters.tom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian.
