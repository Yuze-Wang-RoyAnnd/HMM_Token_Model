"good times," in my opinion, is a must-see cbs hit! despite the fact that i've never seen every episode, i still enjoy it. it's hard to say which one is my favorite. also, i really love the theme song. if you ask me, even though i like everyone, it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show throughout its entire run. everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, even though it can be seen on tv land now, i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.
