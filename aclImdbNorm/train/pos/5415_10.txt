early hollywood at it's best!! a classic kipling poem is transformed into an epic adventure featuring memorable performances by a stellar cast. i think the measure of a good film is how many times you can watch it and still genuinely enjoy it. i've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and, admit it, you do too!!
