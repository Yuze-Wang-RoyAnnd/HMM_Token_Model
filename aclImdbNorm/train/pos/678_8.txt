peter weir's first international success, the last wave is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal myth. richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalries. david gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide chamberlin thru the realm of 'dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native australian history and tribal custom. heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations. nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you.
