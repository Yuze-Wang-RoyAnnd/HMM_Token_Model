sweet romantic drama/comedy about stewart and sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. you can guess the rest. it's beautifully acted by the entire cast (especially sullavan, stewart and frank morgan), has a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. it takes place in budapest and was shot in hollywood, but i found myself believing i was seeing budapest! everything looks so perfect and dream-like. a one of a kind film. don't miss it!
