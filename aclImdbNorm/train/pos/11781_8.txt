the documentary presents an original theory about "guns, germs and steel". the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory, and defend the theory against common criticism.<br /><br />i was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series. they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school. indeed, it does. in fact, i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis.<br /><br />so, if you like knowing why things work, if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked, if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked, you will enjoy this series. a definite recommendation.
