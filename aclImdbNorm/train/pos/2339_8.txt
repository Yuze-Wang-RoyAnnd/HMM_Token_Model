i love this show. now, i'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if it bares any resemblance to them, i didn't notice. i like the storybook quality of the cinematography. i even like the love story, even though as i am enjoying it i wonder in the back of my mind how the heck that part of the story can truly develop seeing as ned cannot touch chuck or else... well, you know. i even like chuck, i don't find her annoying at all, and i generally hate overly sweet, nice, perfect characters. i even like the narrator's voice, even if it bothers one of my family members and bares some resemblance to some walgreens commercials. i could nitpick about all the other things about ned's predicament and how the writers are going to address it in the future but i just rather watch and wait and see what tale the writers weave.
