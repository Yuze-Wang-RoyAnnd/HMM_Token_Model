this movie was great! it was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. the animation was somewhat odd, but nothing new from disney. it was definitely better than expected for a disney movie with no singing.<br /><br />the background animation was magical. it was a different level of work for the disney people. some of the characters were a little boxy, but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the scenery. the music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie. this was definitely not a film that needed the characters to bust into song.<br /><br />perfect. 10 out of 10.
