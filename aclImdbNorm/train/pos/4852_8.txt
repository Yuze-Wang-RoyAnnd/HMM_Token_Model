now this is one of big's best, jack hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey & murdoch. it boasts a great stalwart cast, who ham the play up for all they're worth, especially askey of course. histrionics were provided by linden travers, melodramatics by herbert lomas, and pragmatics by richard murdoch.<br /><br />the group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all. his repartee with everyone falls between side-splitting and ghastly dull. when the formula works it's very good, but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is. but those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any god britain hasn't got any nowadays!<br /><br />ultimately a nice harmless film, to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll probably be very disappointed!
