i cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers. they are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. i would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen basic instinct 1, perhaps someone very young ? i left the cinema feeling glad that i had not been swayed by the imdb reviewers. 14 hours later i am still trying to find flaws in the plot but i cannot think of anything serious. my advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind.<br /><br />it follows a similar pattern to basic instinct 1 but the plot is less confused. it still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way. sharon stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well; this remains her defining role. david morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no michael douglas. of the supporting cast i particularly liked david thewlis as the police detective.
