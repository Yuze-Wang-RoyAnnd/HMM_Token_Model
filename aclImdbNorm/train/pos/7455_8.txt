goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history. their is no doubt about that. but this game, although quite different, could quite possibly be the modern-day bond champ, of its time.<br /><br />this was not a bond game based on material from another medium. this was a completely new; scripted game. which even had its own theme song! (wouldnt be bond without it, haha!) gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike, you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />unlike some/most games, these cast members portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creations for the game. which gives it that more cinematic feel. with a very 'bond'-able storyline, you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie.<br /><br />enjoyable in all aspects, from start to finish. even after beating the game there's still plenty more to be done. with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-out game. despite being quite old now, in video game years. it's still a good game that you can pick up & play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life. even now just thinking about it, i've got the theme song stuck in my head. such a great cast and well-written storyline.<br /><br />the story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were their in front of you, and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself. superbly done, in true bond fashion. which can only be named awesome, completely awesome.<br /><br />i've gotta go throw this game on now. if you haven't played it yet, you're missing out!
