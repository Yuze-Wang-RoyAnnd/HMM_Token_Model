what is with all of the european (especially england) comments here? all i gotta say is that when i saw this movie for the first time when i was like 13 i thought it was great. of course it's stupid. that's the point. you have to see the movie dr. strangelove and men in black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come on people, what did you expect to see? i can think of many movies that are far worse than this, and they were expensive hollwood films with real actors in them. for what it's worth, men in white is a very stupid-funny mock of a movie. and with all the stupid-funny stuff that england has been making for the last half century, i am shocked at all the negative comments. us stupid americans like our stupid humor. p.s., see 'team america: world police" for some true laughs that europeans will especially like. ha!
