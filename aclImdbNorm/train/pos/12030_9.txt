hi, im scott (a.k.a woody7739) i love the film twisted desire, and i love watching melissa joan hart on the t.v as i think she is fine. i am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too, so this helped my watch it (don't ask). i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very carfully, as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles, so she wont give away her fingerprints (a very well planned out idea), back i guess it all backfired on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. i give this film a nine out of ten, and put it in my top 10 films list. and last but not least if anyone see's this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and didn't record it. bye
