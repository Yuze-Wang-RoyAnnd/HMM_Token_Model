this is a cute little horror spoof/comedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira: mistress of the dark, the most infamous horror hostess of all time. this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network. they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit-com never made it past the pilot stage due to it's sexual references. this film however, is very amusing. elvira is the modern-day chesty morgan and the queen of the one-liners. this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal "elvira's haunted hills" which was meant to be a take-off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on it's face. watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience!
