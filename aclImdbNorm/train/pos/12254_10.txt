i've seen this movie after watching paltrow's version. i've found that one a very good one, and i thought this would not be as good... but i was wrong: british version was far better and enjoyable! i found jeremy northam more "agreeable" than mark strong, but i can say that strong catches much better austen's knightley. anyway, both versions are good,but anyone that loved austen's books, should watch this movie. i agree with *caalling*: andrew davies changed a few things, but still remains faithful to the original.<br /><br />10 out of 10<br /><br />my 2 cents!
