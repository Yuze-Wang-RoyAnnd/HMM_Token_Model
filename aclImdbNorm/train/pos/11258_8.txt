spoilers! classic 70's sex trash! the swedish gal (helga) was what made this movie so great. she was beautiful, but what really got to me was how sexual she was. she exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film. her best scenes were when she was, er, stimulating herself. whenever she was on screen, i became transfixed.<br /><br />also, the doctor julia (sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film) was very interesting visually. although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than julia, she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes (especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt) also grabbed my attention unmercilessly. you also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid; i don't know if i've ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time. classic stuff!
