all dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies i've ever seen. i first saw it when i was like 3. now i'm 12 and i rented it, it makes me think of things and it brings back so many memories, those were "the days". i love the music, i love when charlie is arriving in heaven, i love the song "let me be surprised". i love how charlie looks and his voice, bert reynolds could only play charlie's voice this great. i love this movie, the 1st one is the best one because it's so original and great. it really does bring back memories that no one can describe, not even me. if only i could go back to those days. i love the characters. if this is the way the memories come back when i'm 12 imagine how i'll feel when i'm like 19, i hope i'll be able to watch this when i'm older. when i first seen this i never knew that i would really look back on it and feel this way , i hope it will be available to watch. i'm so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart. on a scale from 1-10 i'd give it a perfect 10. it's an amazing movie. it's so hard to explain the feeling, when i get older and if i have kids, i hope they can experience this feeling.
