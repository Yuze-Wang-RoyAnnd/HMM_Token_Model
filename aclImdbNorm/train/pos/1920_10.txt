paul hennessy and his wife, cate must deal with their two teenage daughters and weird son...but after the untimely passing of john ritter, the show became more about coping with the loss of a loved one...<br /><br />i found this show, passing through the channels one afternoon and i have to say i was laughing myself till my ribs ached, simply at the range of characters; the witty lines and the situation paul would find himself dealing mostly with his daughters...from then on, i caught the rest of the show when i was free and i have to say the writing was very good..but then i read about john ritter's death...shortly afterwards i watched 'goodbye' part 2 and i have to say i was nearly in tears, watching the emotions of the characters, losing a loved one...how rory punches a wall in anger and frustration...how cate deals with having to sleep in her bed all alone....briget and kerry talking about what they should have done.<br /><br />but the show does move on, bringing with it jim egan and cj barnes who provide great laughs, as cate's father tries to protect his family and give 'man issue talks' to rory...but the true gem is cj...who is absolutely hilarious as the wild cousin.<br /><br />it will always be john ritter's masterpiece.
