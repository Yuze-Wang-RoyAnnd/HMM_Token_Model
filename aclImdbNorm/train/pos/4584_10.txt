i have not seen each and every one of chan's movies, but this is for sure the best one i have seen so far.<br /><br />the story in it self is nothing special really, so i won't go deeper into that. what makes it special is the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. the movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it. all the cool stunts (of course made by jackie himself)makes you want jump around in the couch and scream. it's just awesome! even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it.<br /><br />i know this police story can be a bit hard to get a hold of, at least it is here in sweden. but i can assure you, it's worth a try.
