and a made for tv movie too, this movie was good. the acting in it and the plot was just so great. this one of the only movies i've seen that i felt warped my mind because after seeing it i was afraid of reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen. there were just a few minor things wrong with this movie, but it's very easily over looked.<br /><br />antonio sabbato jr did an excellent role in this movie along with janine turner and robert wagner. this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because i never thought a low budget tv movie could be so powerful. after viewing this i read the novel this movie was based on (four times) and it too kicked was great. if you ever see this movie come on tv, i'd watch it. the effects in this movie were pretty well done, i honestly don't know what a live calcifying human would look like but with the way the fx team did this movie i was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad made for tv movies out there with low budgets shouldn't suck so bad.<br /><br />watch it. it's really good, no really, it is!
