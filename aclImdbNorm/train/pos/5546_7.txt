some people say this is the best film that prc ever released, i'm not too sure about that since i have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries. i will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they, or any other studio, major or minor, ever released.<br /><br />the plot is simple. the ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring. into this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghosts victims, the current ferryman. she takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she loves.<br /><br />shrouded in dense fog and set primarily on the single swamp set this is more musical poem than regular feature film.listen to the rhythms of the dialog, especially in the early scenes, their is poetical cadence to them. likewise there is a similar cadence to the camera work as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death, innocence and guilt. the film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson more than a normal horror film. its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history.<br /><br />this isn't to guild the lilly. this is a low budget horror/mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained. its tale of love and revenge is what matters here, not the poetical film making and it holds you attention first and foremost (the technical aspects just being window dressing.) if there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production. the fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land. the constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you do wish that we could see something else.<br /><br />don't get me wrong i do like the film a great deal. its a good little film that i some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken. its definitely worth a look if you can come across it.
