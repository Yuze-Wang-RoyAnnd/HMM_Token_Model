i saw this movie when i was little - it was called "glacier fox". i was totally traumatized by it! it follows a cute little fox family around. the beginning was great and i remember becoming very attached to the little foxes. i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while i was in hysterics. i won't tell you what happened, but let's just say it doesn't end well for all of the foxes. i was used to disney type nature films where the animals don't really die. oh man. this movie made me cry for hours. it was a good movie...i think - i was really little and truth be told -all i remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die. rent it if you can, but don't show your kids!
