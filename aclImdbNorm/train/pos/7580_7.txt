as much as i have enjoyed the hanzo the razor movies, three is definitely enough: 'who's got the gold?', the final adventure for the japanese lawman with the impressive package, is a fairly enjoyable piece of pinku cinema, but offers little new in terms of ideas whilst taking a big step backwards as far as outrageousness is concerned.<br /><br />the film opens with the appearance of a female ghost, and looks as though it is going to explore supernatural territory, something which might have taken the series in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, after the spook turns out to be nothing but a scooby doo-style ruse (cooked up by a corrupt treasury official keen to keep people away from the lake where he is hiding stolen gold), director yoshio inoue is content to recycle familiar elements from the first two films, the result being a rather stale affair.<br /><br />once again, hanzo heads an investigation that requires him to interrogate women through the use of his mighty penis, slice up his enemies, and abuse his superiors. on the way, we get wild orgies, good-natured rape (hanzo forces himself on women who wind up appreciating his willfulness), and bloody sword-fights.<br /><br />if you've already seen and appreciated the first two films, you might as well watch this instalment to complete the set, but be warned, this is probably the least satisfying one of them all.<br /><br />6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for imdb.
