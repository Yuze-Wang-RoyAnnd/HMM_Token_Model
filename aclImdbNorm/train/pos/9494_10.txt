white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs. he claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made. i generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad, but i made an exception for this one... and i was very glad that i did.<br /><br />it's filled to the brim with action (much of it surprisingly, graphically gory), sleaze (isolated to nudity with a key female character, but there's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious) and outrageously awkward dialogue, all of which adds to the laughter-inducing tone of the film.<br /><br />ginty, the unusual looking star of the exterminator (and countless other low budget action turds) is amusing in the lead, giving the best performance he could muster. williamson is better than usual, clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee (and he doesn't come in until midway through). the rest of the cast is also fun to watch, particularly the villains, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish-mash of spanish and italian. she's priceless.<br /><br />again, i can't stress enough how gory it was. it's not so bloody that it's nauseating, but it's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget. also, when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys, he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers.<br /><br />don't miss white fire. it's a rollicking - if mind-numbingly stupid - action classic.
