i bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night. i do like juliette lewis although i'm indifferent to brad pitt. after this viewing i have to admit he's a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable, and i didn't think "brad pitt" at all.<br /><br />unfortunately i can't say the same for david duchovny. i'm an x-files fan and i had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie, as i'd thought it was made a few years later. i like duchovny but found his character a little two-dimensional here, except where he's doing voice-overs. that part was strong, seemed in character, good intonation, etc. otherwise i kept thinking "agent mulder", which is a pity.<br /><br />michelle forbes was a treat. why haven't i noticed her before? (i'll be looking up to see what other roles she's done and seeing those asap) i am slightly concerned about stereotyping re lewis, this film, and "natural born killers" (a firm favourite). interesting though to see a contrast of characters - in nbk she's a willing accomplice, whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge early's dark side until it's thrust in her face.<br /><br />i enjoyed this film almost unreservedly. apart from duchovny's character not seeming fully-formed (and perhaps being "washed out" somewhat by pitt's), it was perfect. i was also pleased with the ending - glad that the innocent heroes did not die, yet they had to suffer first. it was realistic, tense, disturbing.<br /><br />if you like nbk you may well like this movie, and vice-versa.
