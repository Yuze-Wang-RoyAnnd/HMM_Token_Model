here italy (i write from venice). why cancelated? the abc should have given it a chance to build an audience. the cast (w/hope davis, campbell scott, erika christensen, zoe saldana, jay hernandez and bridget moynahan) is one of the best i've seen in recent. we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones. i hope that abc will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up. please sign online petition to abc: http://www.petitiononline.com/gh1215/petition.html please sign online petition to abc: http://www.petitiononline.com/gh1215/petition.html
