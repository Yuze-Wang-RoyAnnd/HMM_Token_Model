maybe i'm biased to foxes, fox stories and all but i thought this was wonderfully done.<br /><br />i really enjoyed that it was shown when lily wasn't comfortable, such as the fire and the room (trying not to spoil too much here). i think that's important for kids to see and try to understand.<br /><br />after reading a few others comments i'm a bit confused, one says that at the end -spoiler- the mother and her son appear, as she's been the one telling her son about her story. the movie i saw did not have the mother or son at the end, merely a painting of a girl with a fox. can someone enlighten me on that? anyway i really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through. still worth it if they can sit still.
