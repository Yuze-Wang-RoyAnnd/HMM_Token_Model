when this first came out, my dad brought it home- we were amazed by it- it was so different from anything we had seen before. i was looking for a specific movie last night, and i found 'the mind's eye' again. the box is falling apart, and i am surprised that the tape still works! although it is not 'finding nemo' quality graphics, it is still very good. they should sell this again- it is a landmark for computer animation imagery. highly recommended!
