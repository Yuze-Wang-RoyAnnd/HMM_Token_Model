i love this anime! i was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence (mostly from akane ranma's reluctant but short tempered "fiancee")is so slapstick however ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends...clumsily. the main character ranma goes to china to train only to fall into the cursed jusenkkyo spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water. from then on it's pure chaos one after another. among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of kuno and kodachi, the sexy shampoo, the pervert happosai all causing trouble for our hero/heroine. however it is ranma's selfish father genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time. if anyone want an anime that's funny, this is the one. it's cuter and better with the japanese dub.
