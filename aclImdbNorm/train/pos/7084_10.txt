i can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies. it is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still i can't decide. i definitely liked it. this is the first movie of terry gilliam that i have seen. my first impression? i was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex(to be confusing).<br /><br />the movie is set in the future. a man james cole(bruce willis) is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past(1996 to be specific). a virus killed 5 billion people. he is sent from the future to get some information about it. also involved here are a psychiatrist called kathryn railly. the love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life. the loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end.<br /><br />one thing i liked about this movie is that unlike other post-apocalyptic movies, the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life. "you want to see the ocean, be with her" is especially a poignant line in this movie. it chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on. this is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's. the complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters.<br /><br />the performances are quite good. bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love. his desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully. i have to check out his other movies. the gorgeous madeleine stowe is quite a treat to watch. ever since i saw this movie, i have become so obsessed with her. she has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him. brad pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named jeffrey goines. his oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him.<br /><br />the end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie. the length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested. and every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary.<br /><br />good thriller 10/10
