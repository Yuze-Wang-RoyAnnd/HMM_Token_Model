kudos to director and cast for such a realistic film. the grittiness, lack of glamor and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there. i was truly impressed by how dates and information were relayed within the film; ie newspapers, letters, etc. it kept the film moving at such a fast pace i didn't feel the urge to fast forward once. personally, i thought all the principles did a tremendous job...it was great to see bosworth and kudrow in such difficult roles. it made me want to cry at times. val kilmer didn't surprise me...his performances of this nature usually leave me in awe. overall, this is a brilliant film not to be missed!
