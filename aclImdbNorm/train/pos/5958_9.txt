unlike some comments, mine is positive. this movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends, some you like, some you don't. a few are related--mother, daughter, son. their stories are not one smooth, happy with everyone and everything, type of life--much like real life. some story lines do not evolve, they just happen. but like true families and good friends, they stick together. the wanna-be parents who are buying a baby are such a--holes! you are happy for the ending. poor delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself, her mom, her son, and trying to keep all their lives together. this does not end with a sunset walk or house in the 'burbs and all are living in a dream world, but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day, month to month. overall, this is a good story and a great movie!!
