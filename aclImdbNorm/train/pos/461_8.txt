being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb.<br /><br />it's your basic 'who done it?' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end. i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standard.<br /><br />to me it was worth watching more than once so i'll give it an 8 on imdb.
