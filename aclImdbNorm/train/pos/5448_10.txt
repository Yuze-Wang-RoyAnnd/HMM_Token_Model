this movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. miriam flynn is excellent as bunny packard. zane buzby as delores is comic genius. the rest of the cast is amazing, and the film is really really funny. a definite satire of horror films, with a zany twist. if you enjoy a fun, comedy filled evening, then go and rent this classic. you'll laugh all the way through!
