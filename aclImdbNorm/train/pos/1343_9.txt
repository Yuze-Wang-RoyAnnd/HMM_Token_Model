thre isn't a single scorsese movie i'd place on a list of my favorite movies. but this is the best thing i've run through my dvd player in about five years. scorsese's patient elucidation of favorite film moments, and how hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. <br /><br />it's 3 dvd-sides worth of material. it would have to be a british production, since everything about american corporate culture would have trampled the quiet, methodical, no frills, put-the-focus-on-the-content approach that is taken here. and an american production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites. i wish everyone took a page from his love of movies. you should love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. not just more "me-too" votes for the godfather, etc.. people have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. if they did, movies would be more interesting than they are. scorsese does know what ideas are being explored, and that makes him a compelling, involved speaker on the topic. i really appreciate his articulate, generous interviews over the last decade.<br /><br />on a negative note, scorsese is best when he's excited to show you some obscure movie, rather than when he's didactically teaching you something well-established about film history. and i do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose. it's very distracting.
