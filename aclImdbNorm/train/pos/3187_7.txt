a few years ago, i bought several $1 dvd's that contained two movies each. one of them had three broadway girls (an alternate title for the greeks had a word for them) and this one, happy go lovely. it's basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in scotland and concerns mistaken identity involving one of the dancers hitching a ride from a millionaire's limousine. vera-ellen is that dancer and-wow, what legs! ceasar romero is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks she's dating the millionaire whose car i just mentioned. and david niven is that rich guy who, when looking for vera-ellen, is mistaken for a reporter who's supposed to interview her but gets stalled by romero. what i've just mentioned may be confusing but (mostly) makes sense if you're willing to check your brain while watching this charmingly screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers as performed by the exquisite ms. vera-ellen. romero can be a bit frantic here but niven becomes hilariously bemused throughout. the print i saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it's in public domain. and vera-ellen does pretty well with her lines since she's not really an actress. so on that note, i highly recommend happy go lovely for movie buffs who love old-fashioned musical comedies.
