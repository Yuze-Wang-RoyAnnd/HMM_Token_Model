even though i'm quite young, the beatles are my absolutely favourite band! i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can remember.<br /><br />it's the sort of film that is worth trying the once. i can see why it wasn't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv. i was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film, it didn't much details except something like, 'john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up, jared harris stars'. i'd never heard of him (he played john) or aiden quinn who played paul. however they are certainly underestimated actors!<br /><br />the film had a slow start but as it developed, i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters. as a huge fan, i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like. the script was brilliant and harris got lennon's accent, personality and mannerisms spot on! quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent. the make-up artists made them look excellent.<br /><br />this paragraph may be counted as a *spoiler*:<br /><br />as i mentioned before, it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film. i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians. as for lennon's rude line in the italian restaurant, totally unnecessary. the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it.<br /><br />it is quite different from the other biographical films i've seen where it's about how the beatles got together and became famous, and those never really did the characters that well. e.g. 'backbeat'.<br /><br />in conclusion, i would say, if you're a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan, give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise. at only about 95 minutes long, it's worth waiting for the film to develop.<br /><br />if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the 'comments page' for this film, i'd be very interested.
