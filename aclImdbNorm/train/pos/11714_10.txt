then you must see this film, to understand the reality. having read the book, ms. duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder; formerly labeled manic-depression.<br /><br />it is hard to believe that in this day and age, people still critique others with emotional problems, or those who seek psychiatric help. regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists, and this is unfortunate.<br /><br />in this film, the audience sees the pain and suffering ms. duke had been through, especially as a child. many of us may remember her from the teenage "patty duke show". she was a household name in america by age 15.<br /><br />you learn of her exploitation by the ross'(well played by howard hesseman). as she was growing up in the 1950's, the stigma was in full-force. however, we see as she advances in her career, yet the illness becomes worse. she goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity; even marries someone whom she divorces the next week; and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother. all these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy, and medication.<br /><br />a recent survey released by nami (national alliance on mental illness) recorded that a majority of us adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. it also was released that one in five respondents to the poll believed that people could control their illness without medication if they wanted to. (bp magazine, winter 2006) if you watch this film, you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not "pull herself up by her bootstraps" and "get well" until she was educated about her disorder, and received proper treatment. thank you, ms. duke, for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudice.
