many people like this movie and many more love it, but it seems that it is all for the wrong reasons. scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is.<br /><br />many people say the acting was over-the-top, but who better to do an over-the-top character than al pacino. to say that pacino went over-the-top in here would be an understatement. yet he does it so well, he just brings the inner devil out of you so well. his character tony montana was not such a great guy to begin with but his thirst for power just bring his sickness of greed to another level; an inhumane level. sure at times pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a liability at all. the supporting cast served its job very well. michelle pfeiffer was not really at her best but she certainly fit the role she played. on the other hand steven bauer was at his best, still he is steven bauer. mary elizabeth mastrantonio was good and like michelle pfeiffer fit her role very well. robert loggia i have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell. other than pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances. everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there. they did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough.<br /><br />brian de palma did a very good job directing this movie. whenever an actor is able to become larger than life with his performance some credit should be given to the director and i will certainly give de palma that. brian de palma, though not given the respect, is a very versatile director by my count. he knows how to direct movies according to their genres, but that at times has not turned out well. in here it does, this is by all counts a gangster movie but few are much better than this one because of de palma.<br /><br />the writing was great it was just pure oliver stone. when i saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that oliver stone had written this i was not the least bit surprised. that is a testament to him though. i have always though of him as a great writer and to me he proves this once again with scarface. nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than oliver stone.<br /><br />the music was good but not that great. it is certainly not my favorite from giorgio moroder. the music was a little bit too 80s-ish for me but it didn't annoy me. the cinematography was good, not amazing but really who cares with a movie like this.<br /><br />this has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons. people should realize that the character of tony montana is no hero, he is a monster. he is not inspiring in anyway. he is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated and self consumed. yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster. a vigilante would be like mother tereasa next to scarface.<br /><br />the good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the tony montanas' are not the real problem. if we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don't. in a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society. he is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it. the tony montanas' of this world are the scapegoats of our society. this in no way excuses people like him. instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn't excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer. i love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie, it is a movie that in a strange way makes you self reflect.
