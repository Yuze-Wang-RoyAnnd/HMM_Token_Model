i sat with my children as we watched this film. we all found it to be a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />when billy goes to a new school, a fifth grade bully starts stuff with him and this is what leads to the eating of worms.<br /><br />a bet is made and billy has only so much time to eat 10 worms or else. from this point the bully and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook, fry or bake the worms to try and get billy sick so that he will lose the bet.<br /><br />billy stays strong and eats his way into becoming liked more and more by everyone, even the bullies friends.<br /><br />i wont tell you if he wins the bet or not...you will just need to watch it to find out but i will think that if you like good family movies you will like this one.<br /><br />p.s. let me add that this movie is not just for boys, i have all daughters and they really liked it a lot.
