bend it like beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line. it is about a girl called jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team. there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives. i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve. the song choices are really good, 'hush my child, just move on up...to your destination and you make boundaries and complications.' anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review. bend it like beckham great flick
