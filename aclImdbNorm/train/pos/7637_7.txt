i actually like this movie even though i don't fancy james belushi very much. in this movie, you can actually see several big names on the rise, linda hamilton and courteney cox namely; caine's was already big of course. the plot in this movie is simple; its just like that sliding door movie. it however was told in a light-hearted manner and i like the comedy moments in it. it made me trying to relive my own important moments in live, eg what if i've taken that girl out for a movie, and not the other etc. it tells us that people around us could have taken different roles in our lives if some minute details were to change. it also reminds us to be careful what we wish for. life is not always as good on the other side as we think; maybe, what we have now is the best for us, all things considered.
