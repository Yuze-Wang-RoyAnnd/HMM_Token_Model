i love it when they actually do a sports story well. so many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. not this one. it's just a genuinely nice movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what dennis quaid did in this film. he plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the major leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />all the characters in here are nice people, the kind you root for, from quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (angus t. jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />quaid is believable in playing jim morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he knows how to throw a baseball. he looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. and, most of this film is true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the dvd.<br /><br />so, if you're looking for a nice, inspirational true life sports film, you can't wrong with this one.
