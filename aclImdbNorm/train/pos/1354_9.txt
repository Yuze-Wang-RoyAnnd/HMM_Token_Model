for people interested in business and the corporate world, this show is simply the best of the best. as one of the former contestants of the show wrote in his blog about this innovative show: people in business finally had an audience. the whole idea is perfect; having a group of businesspeople competing against each other in business-related tasks, set in the best place in the world, new york city. donald trump is perfect as the boss, even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity. he also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire, which is one of the negatives about the show.<br /><br />season 1: great season overall, the best season of the "normal" ones. this season was the one that was most about actual business skills. later on the series almost drowned in marketing related tasks with way too many product placements. great and interesting contestants overall, with the most likable character ever in this series: troy. i know i'm not the only person who suspect that the trump world tower-episode where he got fired was rigged to have amy and nick win this particular task.<br /><br />season 2: also a great season. the tasks were still pretty much ok, and it had many interesting contestants. jen m was terrible and should never had made it to the final, imo. also, this season had the worst firing ever (pamela).<br /><br />season 3: terrible. actually, i liked the concept of book smarts vs. street smarts, but the cast was so utterly terrible (it turned out that trump hated the cast as well) that the whole season was a total disaster. best moments was the second episode (motel renovation), with pm brian fired, a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comedy value.<br /><br />season 4: an excellent season, much because of the interesting and entertaining contestants this season (especially randall, alla, marcus and the total disaster whose name was toral). the "take me out to the boardroom" episode is one of the absolute classics of this show, ending with the well-remembered quadruple firing. sadly, i think we got robbed for the randall vs. alla final. i think trump was afraid that she could have won, and prevented that from happening.<br /><br />season 5: a boring season with really no special things to it. brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama. the tasks were terrible overall (how has creating a jingle anything to do with business at all?). i guess the best man won, but personally i couldn't care less.<br /><br />season 6: i can see why they wanted to try out l.a. as a new location for the show, but looking back it was a mistake. new york will always be the place for this. this season added so many new things, most of them terrible (like losing team having to sleep outside in tents, winning pm continues to be pm ,for example). the tasks were terrible and trump also chose the wrong winner. james deserved it, no doubt.<br /><br />season 7: celebrity edition. best season ever. totally different rules (like the use of rolodexes), but all fun and entertainment. the biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all, especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for omarosa, who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in. this looked to be gene simmon's season, but after he made a complete fool of himself during the kodak task , another man emerged from the shadows: piers morgan. never has anyone dominated a season like he did. he crushed his opponents and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor (although some uptight americans (not all americans, of course, don't take me wrong) sadly didn't have the social skills to understand it). way to go piers!!<br /><br />for fans of this i highly recommend the uk version starring sir alan sugar as the boss. in fact, the british version is way better, and that says something since the american (and original) truly is a great show. one thing about the uk version is that the contestants normally tend to behave like decent human beings in the boardroom, unlike the constant yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the us version.
