this is the second animatrix short, and the first of them to be what one could call 'artistic'. it contains a lot of references, metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material, especially with a running time of 9 minutes. i've heard some complaints that this is "anti-human", or tries to direct hate towards man, for their "sins against machine". i don't think that's true; it merely uses the robots to show us, that as humans, we aren't particularly accepting or open-minded towards anyone different from ourselves. i'd say it does a great job of that. the plot is good... it plays as a historical document, recounting what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like. the voice acting is very good, if there is not a lot of it. the animation is nice, and the use of color, in spite of the usually realistic drawing style, makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery. this has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals, as well as a little nudity. the disc holds a commentary, not in english but subtitled, and worth a listen/read. there is also a well-done and informative making of, based on both parts, so i would advise watching it after seeing the next one, as well. i recommend this to anyone who enjoys the matrix universe, and/or science fiction in general. 8/10
