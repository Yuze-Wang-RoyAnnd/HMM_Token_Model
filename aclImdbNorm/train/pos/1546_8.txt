i saw this movie once in or close to its release year 36 years ago (1969). although i can now only remember bits of it, i long to see it again. the parts i remember, rightly or wrongly, include mustard gas in the trenches and suzie kendall as a german spy, offering some bloke sexual favours in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him. the music score was especially memorable and emotion stirring in the league of gone with the wind and i would love to hear it again. there must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available. anyone know why? i doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest.
