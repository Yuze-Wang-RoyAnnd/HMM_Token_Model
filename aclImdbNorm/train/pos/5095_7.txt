king's solomon's mines brings us patrick swayze (playing allan quatermain)who has spent a lot of time in africa, but decides it is time to return to england and be a father to his son. he finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit. in comes alison deedy (playing elizabeth) whose father is in africa and being held by an african tribe for ransom of the map elizabeth's father had sent her. elizabeth seeks out quatermain to take her back to africa to find her father.<br /><br />there is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with quatermain and elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (russians) who want the map also.<br /><br />the movie holds your attention until the end. patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the rugged silent good man, anger and strength; in king solomon's minds his character actually smiles a few times. i would really like to see patrick swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again, one in which he doesn't have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong. maybe a little dancing would help. but this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it.
