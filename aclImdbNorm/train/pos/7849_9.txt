this short is a puzzlement. words fail me here, as this is almost indescribable, technically exceptional after more than 90 years (the visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing), this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or "normal'-because it most certainly is not either. this be an odd one, gang. well worth checking out, but if things like ren and stimpy make your head hurt, you may want to skip this. recommended.
