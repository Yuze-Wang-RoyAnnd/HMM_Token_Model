robert siodmak does a fabulous job with this b noir starring ella raines, franchot tone, and alan curtis. and he does it, i might add, without a lot of help from his male actors, i.e., curtis and tone. it's raines all the way, a pretty, leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her "noir" counterparts.<br /><br />siodmak's use of sex, light, shadows, and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre. the shadows, lighting effects, and camera angles are all effective. but the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by elisha cook, egged on by an excited raines. it's this scene that brings "phantom lady" into new territory.<br /><br />siodmak's commitment to the material is matched only by raines, who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man. franchot tone phoned this one in. alan curtis didn't seem upset that he might die and didn't seem happy that he lived. and he never, except for a brief moment in prison, seemed to be in love with raines.<br /><br />the amusing thing about many of these films is that, as world war ii progressed, interest in psychiatry deepened. but often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as "possessed," "spellbound," and "the greatest show on earth." tone is called paranoid by thomas gomez - tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder, but he appears to be closer to a psychopath. in actuality, as evidenced by his headaches, he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain.<br /><br />phantom lady doesn't have the greatest plot, but it's well worth watching.
