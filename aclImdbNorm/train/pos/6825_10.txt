i was absolutely blown away by john cassavetes's opening night. it's the first movie of his that i've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale, thus it feels more mainstream, but it still doesn't feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films. that is perhaps what makes it so intense. there is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie.<br /><br />it's about what in fact cassavetes has made a staple of his career, an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front. rowlands's character, middle-aged stage actress myrtle gordon, cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse, resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage, until she finds the right one. it's a daringly abstract premise.<br /><br />this is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing. no one understands why myrtle does many of the things she does, and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive, yet it just might be the best thing for her. it may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown. a withdrawal, a cocoon, a rebellion, it all culminates into a meltdown. cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch, which is that early on, she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character, yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true.<br /><br />the last scene, the climactic performance that myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, hard-hitting, enlightening, and enjoyable moments i've ever seen in a movie.
