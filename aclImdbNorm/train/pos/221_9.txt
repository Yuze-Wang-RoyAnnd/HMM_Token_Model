i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out. i didn't really understand the humor back then, but this movie can make me laugh out loud.<br /><br />with all due respect to george burns (rip), walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film. his performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, willie clark. his mannerisms are first-rate. ("you know what kind of songs he wrote? sh*t!" and when speaking to the spanish-speaking guy at the front desk: "no! no! no enchilada!!") absolutely hilarious!<br /><br />kudos to richard benjamin, who played straight man to matthau.<br /><br />i just wish this was on dvd, because my vhs recording is getting a bit old.<br /><br />i had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen, because in no way can it match the original.
