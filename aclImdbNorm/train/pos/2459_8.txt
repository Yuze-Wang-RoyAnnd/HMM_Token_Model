a beautiful and touching movie that deserves a wider viewing than it is likely to get. semra turan plays aicha, a second generation turkish immigrant, who tries to break the mold. neither entirely at home with her moderately conservative muslim family, nor with her liberal danish friends, aicha's martial arts experience becomes a fight to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be who she wants to be in spite of both family and friends.<br /><br />director natasha arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative so that it has depth without becoming ponderous philosophical discourse, and drawing on xian gao's choreography skills pays off in spectacular fight sequences. in the end, however, it is semra turan's stunning debut performance that gives this movie spirit. raw charisma and requisite martial arts skills are complimented by heart to make her personal drama believable.<br /><br />well worth your while.
