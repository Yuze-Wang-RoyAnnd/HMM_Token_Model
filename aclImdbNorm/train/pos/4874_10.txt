kusturika made it again. another masterpiece. a coral comedy full of his own landmarks, with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! the music is everywhere, and also the shooting, the animals, the crazy bastards, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, everything colorfully visual to entertain only. pure cinema in essence. a wonderful experience to watch. and one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare, and so wonderful. well, this is one, and if you enjoyed kusturica's previous films, you'll love this, although, as in all comedies, it is about a chemical reaction, and you have to be in the mood for it.
