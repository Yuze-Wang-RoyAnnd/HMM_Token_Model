this is a great example of a good, dumb movie. no, it is not high art by any means. nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks. but so what! the killer tomatoes series (four movies and a cartoon series) are basically good-natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks.<br /><br />as the title suggests, this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france. in this case, professor gangrene (john astin's 3rd time in the role) has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france. steve lundquist returns as igor, a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long-lost true king of france. obviously he also plays the aforementioned l-l t k of f, happily skewering the french language.<br /><br />opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato (like the others, ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon) and his human allies. mark price, recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series, plays a thinly disguised version of himself, passing himself as "michael j fox" as a way to win the girl of his dreams. and angela visser is a dream as marie, gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis. oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career! another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell (now best known as the hapless title subject of "who wants to marry a millionaire?"). like co-creator john de bello, rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series.<br /><br />what can you say about jon de bello? not much, really, except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and, having done that, has apparently dropped into obscurity. john, if you ever see this, thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes.<br /><br />the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie. like return of the killer tomatoes, the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew. and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox. this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send-off to the series. okay, the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series (which was also quite clever), but cartoons just aren't the same.
