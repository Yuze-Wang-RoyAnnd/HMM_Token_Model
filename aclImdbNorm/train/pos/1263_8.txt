i enjoyed this movie, granted it is mainly because i enjoy seeing sean connery act and this one has the added bonus of having ed harris and lawrence fishburne in it too. the story has a grandma seeking out connery's assistance because her grandson is in prison and she says he was wrongly convicted. at first it seems there may have been some racist aspects of the case, however it later turns out the main officer on the case was black himself and it seems he did some rather bad things to coerce a confession out of the boy. well the boy tries to point to another killer locked up in the same prison, one who is about to be put to death. he is a particularly nasty person too, as he takes a lot of joy in what he did, writing the relatives of his victims and trying to get people to mail them. a lot of twists and turns in this one with some of it being somewhat unexpected. me i just enjoyed sean connery's character trying to make sense of the whole ordeal. the movie also made me mad in areas, especially when you find out what ultimately happened. you get very good interplay between connery and harris and connery and fishburne as they all shine rather well in this one. in the end this one makes for a rather good suspense/thriller.
