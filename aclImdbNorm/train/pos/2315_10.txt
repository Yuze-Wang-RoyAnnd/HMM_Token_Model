there is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise. let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese witherspoon. that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed. robert mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work. every frame of the man in the moon is evidence of film making at its best.
