pinjar is truly a masterpiece... . it's a thought provoking film that makes you think and makes you question our culture. it is without a doubt the best hindi movie i have seen to date. this film should have been shown at movie festivals around the world and i believe would have been a serious contender at cannes. all the characters were perfectly cast and urmila matkondar and manoj bhajpai were haunting in their roles.<br /><br />the story the movie tells about partition is a very very important story and one that should never be forgotten.<br /><br />it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story. here, no one country is depicted as good or bad. there are evil indians, evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis. the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful and haunting. everything about the movie was amazing...and the acting just took my breath away. all were perfectly cast.
