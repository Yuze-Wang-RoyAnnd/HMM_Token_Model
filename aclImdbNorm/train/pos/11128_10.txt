first i would like to say how great this. it is astounding and sometimes shocking. and to say the least i'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, i can definitely stand a boring film, but this is anything but boring. it is like a trip through humanity. its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers (voight and hoffman) who build a mutual friendship. joe buck (voight) a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women. soon he meets rico 'ratso' rizzo (hoffman), who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent. ratso becomes joe's 'manager' but soon both men can't find joe a job which results in stealing food. as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is. they can't get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratso's dream spot, florida. the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film. from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life.
