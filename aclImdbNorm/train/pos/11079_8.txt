i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think, and don't just drip-feed the answers to their audience. "revolver" is one of these films, and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow, with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it. first time. true, it doesn't compare to other mind-mucks like "the usual suspects" or "memento", but in its own right its an intelligent and thought-provoking film. <br /><br />another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is. every scene, every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages. if you see it you'll know what i mean.<br /><br />so, to conclude... watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it. if not, well, no-one ever said "revolver" is for everyone. and that's my 2 cents.
