the film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect. it's not a bad movie; it's actually pretty good. if you don't like the show, don't see the movie. it starts off a little slow maybe, but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny. there are even a few "heart-wrenching" scenes toward the end. after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you. also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existience. he's got a pretty good point. we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives, so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv, too. if they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all, we'd eat it up. do we not like his guest doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a "leave it to beaver" world?
