harvey keital's best performance so far the new century. very nicely photographed, a beautiful snap-shot of pre-castro cuba. the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections. it's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger, much more complex world that he doesn't yet understand.the script is strong and filled with humor, the direction is crisp. over all, a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema. the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound english rather than spanish - probably to improve sales in the us. unfortunately, this just makes the film a little less convincing. but if you can see beyond this, you will find a heartfelt trip to another world. recommended.
