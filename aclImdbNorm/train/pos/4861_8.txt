joan fontaine is "a damsel in distress" in this 1937 musical starring fred astaire, george burns, and gracie allen. the plot, what there is of it, is about a british woman (fontaine) in love with an american, who is mistaken for astaire, a musical comedy star.<br /><br />the film, directed by george stevens, contains some wonderful gershwin music, including "nice work if you can get it" and "a foggy day." the best scene is the "stiff upper lip" number, which takes place in a fun house.<br /><br />astaire's singing voice sounds more robust in this film than it does in others, and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers. burns plays his over the top publicist and allen is burns' secretary. she's hilarious. the problem, as others have pointed out, is fontaine, who has to dance with astaire at the end of the film. stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot, and it takes place among the trees. i would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy.<br /><br />definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.
