this is an early film "pilot" for the hit canadian tv show trailer park boys. it was played to executives at a few networks before showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series. great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films. the movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around "exterminating" peoples pets for money. if you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to! but they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout. watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series. i highly recommend it!<br /><br />rated r for swearing, violence, and drug use.<br /><br />its not too offensive either (they dont actually show killing animals)
