my observations: postwar hilarity. tom drake and grandpa from "meet me in st. louis" two years later (the year i was born). donna reed charming and pretty. margaret hamilton good as always; smaller part than in "wizard of oz". spring byington way prettier, also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by hamilton. tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious. as a two year veteran of army tents, he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when i looked into his eyes.<br /><br />i used to work in a department store, and it was just as elegant as this one. sadly, it has disappeared and faded into obscurity. we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store, to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandise.<br /><br />10/10
