although she is little known today, deanna durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a pretty teenager with a perky personality and a much-admired operatic singing voice. this 1937 was her first major film, and it proved a box-office bonanza for beleaguered universal studios.<br /><br />three smart girls concerns three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long-unseen father when their still-faithful mother reveals he may soon remarry--with the firm intention of undermining his gold-digger girlfriend and returning him to their mother. although the story is slight, the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a neat screwball touch. durbin has a pleasing voice and appealing personality, and such enjoyable character actors as charles winninger, alice brady, lucile watson, and mischa auer round out the cast. a an ultra-light amusement for fans of 1930s film.<br /><br />gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer
