ok, so the fx are not high budget. but this story is based on actual events. not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors, even richer!! as most movies that are based on books, there are somethings that just don't fit. only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events, not a knock-off as most people believe it is!! this movie is in no way related too twister! other than both movies are about tornadoes.<br /><br />for those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a couple of things you need to remember... the actual "night of the twisters" was june 3, 1980. so this movie was released 16 years after the actual events. try think how far storm research has advanced in that time. it happened in a larger town; grand island, nebraska is the third largest city in the state. even though the movie calls the town something else, and says it's a small town. for the real story check out: http://www.gitwisters.com/
