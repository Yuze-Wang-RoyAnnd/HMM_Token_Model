definitely one of my favourite movies. the story is good, acting is great, all technicals (especially cinematography) are sharp and the script is clever.<br /><br />heath ledger is terrific as edward ''ned'' kelly. he is gripping as the legendary outlaw, and is supported well by geoffrey rush, naomi watts and orlando bloom. all action sequences are on point<br /><br />the film is edge-of-your seat stuff right up to to the end. one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger, who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in. and makes no mistake here.<br /><br />an excellent film all round.
