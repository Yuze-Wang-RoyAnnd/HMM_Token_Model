<br /><br />i have seen this movie many times. at least a dozen. but unfortunatly not recently. however, etched in my memory never to leave me is a scene in which mickey rooney, -"killer mears" knows that he is to be executed and it's getting close to the moment of truth, he dances, and cries, and laughs, he vacillates from hesteria to euphoria and runs the gambit of ever emotion. never have i seen such a brilliant performance by any actor living or dead, past or present. it was then i know for sure that mickey rooney, yes, "andy hardy" was and is a actor of great genius. however i kept it, my opinion to myself for years thinking, surely i must be alone in this viewpoint. about 15 years or so after i saw this film for the last time on television, i chanced to read the old q & a section of the los angeles times. the question was posed to lawrence olivier, and the question was: "mr. olivier you are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, whom then do you consider to be among the greatest actors?" his answer was, "peter finch and mickey rooney" i was stunned, but not surprised. i immediatly flashed back to his "killer mears" and i felt very good for having seen this great ability in him, and now having my view supported by another whos work i admired.. later of course there was "bill" and many other great moments with mikey rooney. this film, "the last mile" should be seen by all acting students. i frankly cannot remember a great deal about the film after all these years but mr. rooney in it, will never leave me. if anyone out there remembers this film the same as i do? i would be interested in hearing from you. for this picture etched in my heart alone i gave it a 10 just on the face of his performance.
