this movie was very, very strange and very, very funny. all of the actors are quite real and very odd. the overall "look" of the film was different, too, sort of dreamy and bleached-out, which only added to the spacey, fumbling, weird vibe of the whole thing.<br /><br />it's not for everyone, i mean, it's not what you would call "mainstream" but that is what i liked about it. it's unlike anything i have ever seen before . . . unpredictable, with a weird rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places. the kids are so heartbreakingly goofy (and pimply) that you can't help but feel for them. in other words, these are far from "hollywoodized" versions of teenagers.<br /><br />all of, which for me, makes it a good thing.
