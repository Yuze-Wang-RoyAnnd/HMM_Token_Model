i was so surprised by how great the man in the moon truly was.i mean at first i was kinda expecting a cheesy, and predictable film, but i decided to put that aside when watching.well, when it was over i was just left stunned(mainly in tears), by how great the man in the moon turned out to be.this movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone, and its just a fabulous film.the acting was great especially from reece witherspoon(who was so cute and lovable), and everyone else.there wasn't anything that really bothered me, i felt the ending kinda predictable, but very well done at that.also i felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before, but still a great film.overall i must say i don't to much to say about this film, not that it was bad, its just a film you either like or don't like.i would however recommend this to any and everyone, even if you don't like these type of films, its still an enjoyable film.<br /><br />8.7 out of 10 stars
