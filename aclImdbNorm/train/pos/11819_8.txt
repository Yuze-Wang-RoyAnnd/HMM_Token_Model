just picked this up on dvd and watched it again. i love the bright colors vs. dark imagery. not a big beatty fan, but this is an excellent popcorn movie. pacino is astounding, as always, and well, this movie marked the period where madonna was her absolute sexiest. i wish she had stuck with the "breathless" look for a while longer. charlie korsmo's first really big role, other than "what about bob?". the makeup effects were cutting edge then and still hold up for the most part. beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment. the cars, wardrobe, buildings, and even the streetlights et a great tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the scenes with a lot of red can get a tad annoying, as it tends to blur a little. just wish beatty had gotten the chance to make a sequel. all in all, a fun few hours.
