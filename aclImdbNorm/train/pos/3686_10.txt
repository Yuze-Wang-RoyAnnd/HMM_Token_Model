diane and i saw this fabulous film today in fremantle and we both agreed that of the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest. i say that because we were entranced by the brief, five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many forms.<br /><br />ostensibly the film took place in the various parisian arrondisments thus giving a particular flavour to each segment. having only been in paris several times, i was not knowledgeable enough to readily recognize the locations but i am sure europeans and particularly french people could easily recognize the city's locations. in any event, the viewer is immediately pulled into each story because of their production excellence so these city locations fade into in-consequence.<br /><br />the film moves quickly and the viewer is left absorbing one scenario while the new one is on the screen. the stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life without the media swath that buries so much of life's beauty under the nearest dung heap just to sell, sell. sell ...<br /><br />go with someone you care for and allow this magical little film to bathe you like a spa treatment and when you leave my guess is you will feel renewed.
