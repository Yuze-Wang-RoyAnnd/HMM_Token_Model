this is not a profound movie; most of the plot aspects are pretty predictable and "tried and true" but it was well-acted and made some interesting points about what we might regret (our "mistakes" as the movie calls them) as we look back over our lives. i had not read the book, so didn't know much other than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories from long ago that she hasn't really shared with anyone. thankfully they got a top-notch cast....meryl<br /><br />streep's daughter, mamie gummer, plays the young lila, and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old lila...in addition to an amazing resemblance (duh!) the younger actress did a great job (perhaps not quite up to her mom's caliber, but who is?) all others in this film were fine, although i wish there had been more of glen close and thought the buddy character was alittle too dramatic. <br /><br />this is more of a girls' movie than for the guys, but a good one to see with your mom, or your daughter, and maybe start some dialog going. how hard it is to really know a parent as a "person"!
