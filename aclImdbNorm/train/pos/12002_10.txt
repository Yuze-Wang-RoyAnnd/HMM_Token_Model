despite reading the "initial comments" from someone who curiously disliked the film -- (why is the only negative comment very first on the list?)it was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it! obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet joseph smith in a positive manner ~ thats the whole idea. and in fact, those points were extremely effective. we already know joseph smith was human... but despite that, and all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary, it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable, god-given work. i'd recommend it to anyone!
