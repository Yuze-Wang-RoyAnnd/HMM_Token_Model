i truly enjoyed this film. the acting was terrific as was the plot. jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for. the only part of this flick i would change was the ending. the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channel.<br /><br />there were some interesting religious messages in this film. jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature (or shark if you prefer) represented the anti-chirst. there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that 'end of the world feel'. i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature. i know many people won't get the references to christianity, but if you watch close you'll get it.
