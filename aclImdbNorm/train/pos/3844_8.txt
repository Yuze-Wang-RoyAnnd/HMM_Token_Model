when you read the summary of this film, you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is, for the primary character of this film, gerard reve (jeroen krabb'e) is haunted by visions and hallucinations. the visions gerard see are all (more or less) subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film. despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film, the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute. this is mostly due to the great performances of jeroen krabb'e and ren'ee soutendijk (christine) and the great direction of the whole by paul verhoeven. his directing style is clearly visible and one can say, looking at it from different angles, that 'de vierde man' is a typical verhoeven film. it will not only seem typical for people familiar with his american films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes, but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his dutch films, because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story. when people watch verhoevens american films, short sighted people might say, he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex. that is what some people think, whereas i think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film. although not a good film, hollow man (his last american film) is an example that verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm. he needs that. just watch his dutch films. not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom, but they also show that he has remarkable talent. 'de vierde man' brought him one step closer to hollywood and is certainly one of his best.<br /><br />8 out of 10
