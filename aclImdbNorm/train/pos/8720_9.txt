all of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of disney studios' last productions, here comes something that should heal your wounds... once and for all, a bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake "hand-made-old-disneys-like" drawings (see the lion king, pocahontas, and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever).<br /><br />a bug's life (1001 pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks !) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say "hey, this thing is computer generated !". no weak parts, a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets, an astonishing 3d bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality)... and that's only to mention the technical aspects.<br /><br />the scenario, my friends, the real backbone of a motion picture, has some thickness ! curiously, and obviously thanks to lasseter's team, there is practically no musical sequence in a bug's life. which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate, but most others dislike (same thing for the parents or the anime fans, like me). this movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring steve martin and chevy chase : the 3 amigos ; it had basically the same background story (a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen (who finally turn to be actors) to protect them, etc...). simple, but efficient, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.<br /><br />since microcosmos, many movies tell tales of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but i do think that a bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all. the humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved... and the whole audience was captivated by flik's (aka tilt in france) adventures.<br /><br />a big thank you for lasseter's team, especially for the last 30 seconds... it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs/actors forget their lines or hit the camera...<br /><br />and finally, especially for those of you who have seen the french version, other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie. a bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment, and i think it will soon become part of my collection of videos (a privilege granted to extremely few movies, and that's not a problem of storage room :). go and see it, that's an order.
