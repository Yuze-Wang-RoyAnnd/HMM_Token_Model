ok here is how i do this. i grade movies on 10 components. each component will inherently start with 5 points. it can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0.<br /><br />mood: action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense - i give this component 10 points. it had a perfect balance of all five aspects. the action was fun and exiting. the romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense.<br /><br />plot - i give this component 10 points. i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. i found my self, sitting in the theatre, returned to my childhood, and in that instant i again believed in unicorns, wicked witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true.<br /><br />cinema photography - i give this component 8 points. while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles, i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera.<br /><br />fx - i give this component 10 points. i love that they used c.g.i. sparingly. the epic scenes were believable. the magical powers were frighteningly realistic. all in all less is more, and this had it all! cast - i give this component 10 points. no names and seasoned actors alike, the cast was amazing! michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked, charlie cox made tristan come to life, claire danes gave emotion to the stars, and i will never look and robert de niro the same again.<br /><br />acting - i give this component 10 points. even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. once again, i will never look and robert de niro the same again.<br /><br />character development - i give this component 9 points. this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.<br /><br />dialogue - i give this component 10 points. the dialogue was smart, witty, fun
