if you are a fan, then you will probably enjoy this. if you don't know who misty mundae, darian caine, ruby larocca, or seduction cinema are, this is not the movie to start out with. it's very cute, silly, the girls are hot, and it's fun to watch. there's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film, but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot's not a total bore. misty mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids, so she's not as hot in this as she has been in others. but her panties in this are quite cute (you'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird). if you do like this one, you will probably enjoy "that 70's girl", "vampire vixens", or "erotic survivor" (which is a bit more sexually graphic). if you prefer watching misty or esmerelda in less sexual, more horror/exploitation-based (but lower budget) movies, check out the factory 2000 website.
