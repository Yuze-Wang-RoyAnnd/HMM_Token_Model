you like to solve mysteries? you like complex narrations? this is for you. brilliant, clever movie by francis leclerc(son of a legendary french canadian signer felix leclerc). flashy photo and clever editing is the word of leclerc, strongly helped by roy dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role.<br /><br />the plot is about alexandre tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. throughout the struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.<br /><br />not spooky, but very mysterious and well played movie. i have my hypothesis on the ending(i think the indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanations.<br /><br />i strongly recommend it 9.5/10
