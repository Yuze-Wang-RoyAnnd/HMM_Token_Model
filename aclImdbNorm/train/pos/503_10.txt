after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb. next gen and ds9 were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek. this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show. the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts. scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before. the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season. when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed. in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of. pity a film or tv movie was never considered. so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell, including the onset of hostilities with the klingons..........
