not knowing what this film was about, i checked it out at the video store and after seeing it, i enjoyed it. little seen multi-genre flick from director bernard rose (candyman, immortal beloved). great story and characters. as a fan of glenne healdy's, i was surprised of her british accent. the only exception for this film was the ending. however, it is worth the rent.
