when a small hobbit named frodo baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the wizard gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord. should the ring end up back in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy middle earth. frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. this is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story. regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated film.<br /><br />the animation is superbly done with rotoscope, which is tracing over live action footage. ralph bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given. the film also boasts a grand music score by leonard rosenman that fits every scene. there are a few plot holes with the script, but that has to be excused, considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films, much had to crammed in the first one. my biggest gripe is some of the character design, samwise was a bit too goofy, while the other hobbits act completely normal. the other characters are actually well written for the screen, and the voice actors do a great job, i was pleased that legolas is actually a bit more helpful to the plot. the rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening, while the ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish.<br /><br />another problem is that the evil wizard saruman is called aruman, thanks to the writers. overall, i think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice, but there is something charming about it. ralph bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories. the film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
