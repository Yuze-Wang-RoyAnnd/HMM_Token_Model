a masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative to say about a chinese ghost story, it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology. the film has a simple premise: a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt. of course, it happens to be haunted as well.<br /><br />what i wasn't expecting the first time i saw this film is that it's one of the most touching love stories i've ever seen; that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches. unlike some films of asian cinema, a chinese ghost story isn't hard to swallow for those that aren't versed in chinese culture. indeed, it plays on timeless, cultureless themes of the paranormal and romance.<br /><br />think evil dead 2, if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix. this film is for real, despite being overlooked by many. it's absolutely among the best i've ever seen. it's ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres, and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere, is nothing short of fantastic. highly recommended, 10/10.
