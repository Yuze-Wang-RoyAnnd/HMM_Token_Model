this is my kind of film. i am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that. but it is also a dark comedy. while i see it mostly as a horror/thriller, there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedy.<br /><br />but either way, it is a fascinating descent into madness. the ending caught me off guard, but what an ending! it leaves the viewer a lot to think about.<br /><br />powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, a great script filled with dread and dashes of humor, and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth watching.<br /><br />personally, i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within. but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do.
