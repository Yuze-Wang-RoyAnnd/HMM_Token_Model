this show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television. i mean the acting is great, the suspense, the drama, the comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: a plane crashed on an island. the characters are great and evangeline lilly is hot!!!!!! matthew fox once again shows us what a great actor he is, josh holloway is so great, jorge garcia is hilarious, i could go on and on. also, the unexpected plot twists, the back stories of the characters, the music that is at the end of every episode. j.j. abrahms has once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is. i mean this is better than alias, and i loved alias. whoever isn't watching this show, should definitely consider getting the dvd's and watching it, because they are missing something great. this show could possibly be the best show in television history!!
