this movie is a very relaxed, romantic-comedy, which is thoroughly enjoyable. meg ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of albert einstein, though she does believe in her own skills. tim robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fianc'e after her car stuffs up. i loved walter matthau as the one and only albert einstein. this movie just has a very relaxing feel to it, while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it (if that is actually possible, it happens here).<br /><br />i personally found this movie extremely entertaining, especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious! this movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. if you have a cheeky sense of humour, this is the movie for you!
