this timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart. so many years have i waited to see this eternal story! i was not ready, perhaps. it is possible that my sensibilities would not have appreciated its power. so i now gratefully welcome it into my soul with gladness.<br /><br />my respect and admiration for paul muni has been long. his is now a legendary luminescence. but now i have finally discovered the priceless gifts of luise rainer's splendid talents. oh, how many faces can speak as did hers? some have said that it was wrought from her silent years, and this well might have been but her speech, is eloquent enough when it is given a chance. she amply deserved her oscar.<br /><br />this movie is in an epic in the most classical proportions. all parts equal, necessary and perfect. naysayers may walk away if they wish, but they would be shunning a storytelling which stays with one a lifetime.<br /><br />the good earth enriches one in ways that one does not expect. but all will not come from it with the joy that i did. but i can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years.<br /><br />do not prod me with mere technicalities regarding the race of the principal players. these are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with utter perfection. but i dare a million score of newer films to tell pearl buck's story with such poignancy, power, conviction and grace.<br /><br />if any modern artist would dare to re-film this masterpiece, i warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic fragrance which still emanates from the core of this telling. time will not diminish this effort nor will progress improve upon its greatness.
