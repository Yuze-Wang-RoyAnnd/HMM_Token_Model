well now, this was certainly a surprise episode. in this anthology science fiction series, with all of this alien beings, extraordinary occurrences and many brushes with the hereafter, this episode would certainly rate as unusual. its seemingly insignificant settings apparently not imparting any morale at story's end. or does it? kicking off with the silent movie form, no recorded dialog, but having musical accompaniment. in this case it's on the sound track, not utilizing the playing of organ or piano by an on sight musician. this part of the episode, along with the ending section, also made liberal use o title cards, just like "the old time movies." while these titles are a bit exaggerated and overdone, they are made so intentionally and with an affection for rather than any contempt for the silent film.<br /><br />veteran comedy film director, norman z. mcleod, was the man in the chair for this half-hour installment. he had been the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time, featuring people like the marx brothers, w.c. fields, harold lloyd and danny kaye. he was no stranger to to tv, as he had done a lot of work on television series.<br /><br />it doesn't appear that he and mr. keaton had ever worked together before(as i cannot find any evidence of this)' but judging by the outcome of the film, they succeeded in doing so with flying colors! anyone who directed keaton was aware that buster was also a fine comedy director as well as a comedy player. he was just as comfortable behind the camera as he was in front of it. their short partnership must have been a harmonious one, with 'give and take' about how to do things. it is apparent that many of the gags were keaton's, resurrected from his own silent picture days. for example, the gag of putting the pair of pants on with rollo's(stanley adams assistance was done by keaton and roscoe "fatty" arbuckle in one of the arbuckle 2 reelers, the garage (1919). that was a clear example of his craft in a nutshell.<br /><br />buster knew that we film our world with a camera, rendering it a two dimensional image. this one fact is at the bottom of so many of gags. it is a cardinal rule for his film making.<br /><br />the cast was small and once again just chock full-of veteran talent. stanley adams was rollo and served as mr. keaton's straight man. jesse white, the old 'maytag repair man', ran the fix it shop that fixed the 'time hjelmet'. gil lamb, serene veteran of rko short comedy series, was the 1890's cop. james flavin, george e.stone, harry fleer, warren parker, and milton parsons all rounded out this largely silent cast.<br /><br />without spilling the beans, let's just say that yes, there is probably a lesson to be learned here. if not the one already mentioned, "the grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence!", then how about, "be careful in what you ask for, because you just may get it!"
