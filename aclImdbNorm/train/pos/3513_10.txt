actor herman jos'e plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two african players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the benfica (club of its heart),fc porto, therefore these players did not play well, and it wanted that the fc port was wronged with this. but what happens is that these two players after all are good and fc porto sell them for much money to a foreign club, making a good business. the film, for a small country as portugal, without great antecedents in great films, is a very good and funny comedy, showing all the rivalry that exists between north/south of portugal (fc porto/benfica). highly recommended
