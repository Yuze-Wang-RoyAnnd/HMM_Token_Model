the story-line was rather interesting, but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts/behavior. more extreme than necessary. also, i think something went wrong in the casting. john turtorro doesn't really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic chess player, not to speak of the italian player. motives weren't very much outlined either.<br /><br />
