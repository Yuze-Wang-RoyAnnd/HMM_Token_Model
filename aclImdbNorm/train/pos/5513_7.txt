from what i've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film, compared to part 1. initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be. soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che's life that he started in part 1. part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. it is not soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of che's life had completely different outcomes. he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. the film is far from perfect. it is probably too long. at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. in part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. che's capture and death are dealt with well. the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish. benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian. so if you've seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2.
