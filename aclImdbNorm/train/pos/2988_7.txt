the original with barbara stanwyk is saved only by stanwyk's performance. the story and the other performances are too sickeningly sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today. bette midler's version is much more interesting. she is stella claire, an independent, free-spirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend (stephen collins) or her friend (john goodman in an underrated performance). she raises her daughter jenny played so sweetly by trini alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that jenny's father can do better for her and ultimately makes a life-altering decision. through out the film, there are plenty of laughs, tears and memorable moments mostly between midler and alvarado. marsha mason co-stars as jenny's would-be stepmother, who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her. if you like midler, goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion you'll enjoy bette midler's version of stella.
