the first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen. it was a bad version of 'back to the future' with zero charm. once accepted that bill & ted are nitwits, the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks.<br /><br />this is a surprise. this is your only spoiler warning...<br /><br />by today's standards, this is more fun. this was shunned upon release, sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time. we get the photographer of 'face/off', the editor of 'fugitive', a production designer from burton's early work, and the sound designer of 'matrix'.<br /><br />the writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep. since this was shunned by the fanbase and public, the director probably decided the style was too extreme. it's not, it fits the material. like 'death becomes her' and 'catch-22', this dares to be smart, but we like our movies "simple" so we don't buy it. probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off. what's so good?<br /><br />--nice self-reference towards keanu; from airhead to messiah. see also arnold schwarzenegger.<br /><br />--joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts, he makes his own hatred. the evil b&t and the "good robot usses" have the same vocabulary as their originals: lesser copies and depreciation of language.<br /><br />--the "duality" motif. nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles, lots of high and low angles. they even use roy brocksmith from 'total recall' to emphasize the point.<br /><br />--the "choices" motif. i don't know where this started in the genre (maybe 'ghostbusters'), but it's used pretty well here. it even boils down to the 7 games against death--battleship and club.<br /><br />--film self-reference, even present in the game against death (clue). this is smarter than tarantino or brooks. notice the premier magazine cover at the end: "bill and ted: the movie." ironic also how death and nomolos were villains in the 'die hard' and 'lethal weapon' sequels.<br /><br />i still have some minor nits, but nothing compared to the original. music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the former--particularly in the teen market. carlin is a great comedian, but in these movies he's wasted. also, for all the daring this effort shows, even cracking gay jokes, they can't kill a cat?<br /><br />so, despite looking like a nickelodeon production, this is incredibly interesting. from this movie we got beavis and butt-head. "we're in heaven and we just mugged three people." <br /><br />final analysis = = midrange material
