i had pleasure to watch the short film "the cure", by first time director ryan jafri. what really impress me are the camera work and music.<br /><br />i think many young filmmakers (as i myself am one of them) would experience hard time with cinematography when just start making of an indie. we see the output are not exactly what we imaged or below our ambitions. but this film, directorial debut from a young director, handled very well on screen. the camera motion, color, lighting, compositing all contribute to the story and emotion of the film.<br /><br />and music, as a key element of film language, helps a great deal too.<br /><br />it's hard to portray a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially in a short. but still, i have to admit i am not a fan of v/o (narration), especially when the film is advanced by narration, instead of shots and cuts. my personal feeling to some of the narrative part is, my guess was the narrator tried a bit too hard. so the energy pushes audience back from the emotion of the film.<br /><br />overall, it's a short film nicely done, i could see the input from a director. way to go, ryan! greeting from china, looking forward to your next.<br /><br />tim
