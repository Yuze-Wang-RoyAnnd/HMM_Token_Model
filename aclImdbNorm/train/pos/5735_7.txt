this is a short, crudely animated series by david lynch (as it says in the beginning), and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods, overall-wearing large man, with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son. both of those elements are harped upon repeatedly in the short episodes, and there's no real plot to be seen. it's easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd, slightly macabre looney tunes- with far more gore, profanity, bloody violence, and occasional moments of hilarity.<br /><br />i bought the dvd along with eraserhead, having previously seen eraserhead. don't look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece- this is anything but. in fact, it seems to almost be a statement against such things, as its rough style spits in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see. as lynch says, "if this is funny, it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all."
