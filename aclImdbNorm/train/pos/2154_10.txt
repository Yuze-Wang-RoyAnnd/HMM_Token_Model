i have seen this movie many many times and i will never get tired of it. it is a classic in every sense of the word. the movie is hysterically funny and yet quite touching all at the same time. for those of you who are not a fan of "subtitles" or of foreign film in general, open your mind. this is a great movie for "the beginner" because the story is so entertaining. don't get me wrong, it is 100% japanese (and that is what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it is just a great laugh at one of the main characters called mr. aoki - one of the funniest characters i have ever seen!)<br /><br />i can't even think of this movie without smiling!! i love it ... and i think most people will too.
