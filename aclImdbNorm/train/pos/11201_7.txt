surprisingly good early effort from alfred hitchcock. one of the only original screenplays written by hitchcock himself, this film shows remarkable story structure. it kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ "one round" jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter. the movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between jack, his girl and the professional boxer. the rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. even in this early film, hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement. an armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness. the only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927. the final match, as a result, ends up being somewhat anticlimactic. the story, though, is what carries this film through.
