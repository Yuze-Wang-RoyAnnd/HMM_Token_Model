bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie, a description of the revolutionary movement in italy, but that seems more metaphor than reality. well, almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor. the revolutionaries, of whom we see and about whom we learn very little, might as well be mafiosi. out with the old and in with the new.<br /><br />andrea's papa, a psychoanalyst, seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values -- morally upright, unperturbed, clean and tidy, thoroughly ritualized.<br /><br />giullia, the girlfriend of a revolutionary, seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands. (i'm guessing here.) andrea, the adolescent boy, seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way "upatz." he's respectful of his father but disobedient too. he loves giullia, or so we assume, although he's not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally, but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams. his course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as "media." he's the man in between, who knows the meaning of gradualism, who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming.<br /><br />most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from "antigone," which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will.<br /><br />that brings us -- by no particular course that i'm aware of -- to marushka detmars. she brings to mind a new yorker cartoon of a few years ago. two hippos are neck-deep in the river, staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank, and one hippo says to the other, "i hate her." she's a good actress. (let me get that out of the way.) but so is everyone else in the film. she carries with her, in her speech and manner, the rich glitter of outright lunacy. and it all comes from the actress too, not from directorial aid. detmars isn't nuts the way catherine deneuve was nuts in "repulsion." the walls don't turn to rubber and grow hands. instead, we see her animated -- sometimes too animated. and she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threatening.<br /><br />a critic described her as sultry, but that's probably not the word he was searching for. she's compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair, her wide white ready grin, her impulsive giggles. and her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient egyptian tombs. the sexy parts are pretty erotic, not so much because one of them is explicit, but because we've gotten to know the characters involved. (it's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick.) actually there isn't that much sex. there is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time. at least real time for an eighteen-year-old boy.<br /><br />the young man who plays andrea is fine too, which is a necessary thing, because the film depends almost entirely on him and giullia. they have to carry it and they do. if it were not for their performances, i'm not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is. it could easily have been turned into a rather slow, boring romance.<br /><br />worth it.
