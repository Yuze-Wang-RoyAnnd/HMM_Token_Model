we're talking about a low budget film, and it's understandable that there are some weaknesses (no spoilers: one sudden explosives expert and one meaningless alcoholic); but in general the story keeps you interested, most of the characters are likable and there are some original situations. <br /><br />i really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot ... i applaud this one on that. <br /><br />if you know what i mean, try to see also "nueve reinas" (nine queens) a film from argentina.
