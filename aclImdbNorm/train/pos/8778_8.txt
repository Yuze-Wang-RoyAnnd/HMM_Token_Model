james j. corbett, heavyweight champion of the world from 1892 to 1897, turned out to be errol flynn's favorite role. possibly because he didn't have to wield a sword or be in a western. he grew tired of the swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was miscast in westerns and couldn't understand why people liked him in them. it is an enjoyable film, but hardly does tell the real story of james j. corbett.<br /><br />as portrayed corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division, a man who used brains and speed more than brute strength to win. he defeated john l. sullivan and lost to bob fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown. he was also a compulsive womanizer and in that was a lot like the man portraying him. of course that was not shown on the screen. the character that alexis smith plays, the banker's daughter who falls for him, has no basis in reality. corbett was in fact married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with both of his wives.<br /><br />also though after he lost his title and after the events of this film are concluded he suffered a great personal tragedy. his father in a moment of depression, probably over finances because he lost heavily betting on his son to beat bob fitzsimmons, shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself. the murder/suicide hardly squares with the happy clan that alan hale presided over.<br /><br />one thing though that i did like about gentleman jim. ward bond got the career role of his life in playing john l. sullivan. director raoul walsh got a great performance out of bond as the blustering, but lovable sullivan. even given some of sullivan's bad points that don't make it to the screen like rabid racism, bond's portrayal is the quintessential john l. and the best thing about gentleman jim.<br /><br />speaking of racism, one thing that should have been told was the fact that sullivan while champion refused on grounds of race to meet peter jackson who was black and from australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time. i say probably because as a challenger corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds to a draw. that fight more than any other created a demand for a sullivan-corbett title match. of course when corbett was champion he refused to give jackson a title shot. maybe he didn't want another 61 round marathon with someone who may have been better on that particular day.<br /><br />gentleman jim is not jim corbett's story, it is a movie of errol flynn playing at being james j. corbett. but corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved flynn's portrayal of his life. it's as he would have liked to have been remembered.
