one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by mc clarens lisp and stunning quote "do you believe in love at first site?".<br /><br />a trace of expressionism was evident in this picture, further catapulting the films flawless integrity. gabby (aka joey) played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography. lol.<br /><br />the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt, the heroic rescue by mc clure as he saved the young 'handicapped' kid with the speech impediment.. which i may add was acted to perfection! james cahiil's use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day. the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic. when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused brothers from the southside gang and the ctm (cut throat mafia). this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill has committed to filming.<br /><br />personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future. thats if i can find it anywhere, lol!
