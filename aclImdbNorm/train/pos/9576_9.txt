one of the most nihilistic and brutal films i've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and moving ones. this is an action-melodrama like the world has never seen it before. sometimes the plot got me close to tears, while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone-crunching blow to the guts. chilling performance by edison chen. the story of a hk-cop and a cambodian killer hunting each other down, while bit by bit losing their humanity, is a strong one. featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera-work, "dog bite dog" is pure hk-bloodshed without the heroism.
