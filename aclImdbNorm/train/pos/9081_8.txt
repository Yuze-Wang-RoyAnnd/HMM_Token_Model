if you like sci-fi, monsters, and ancient legends, then you will love this movie!! <br /><br />the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago. while the acting may have been a little less than desirable, the story line and effects adequately compensated for it.<br /><br />i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tv.<br /><br />if you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myth and lore....you have to see this movie!!
