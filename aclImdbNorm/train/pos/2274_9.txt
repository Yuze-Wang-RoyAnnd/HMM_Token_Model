although i like kurt vonnegut, i'm not particularly interested in spy stories and i didn't know this one. the only reason i watched it was nick nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since i saw "breakfast of champions" and "hotel rwanda". but the film brought me a pleasant surprise. of course nolte was great, but so was the plot. there was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of germans (and, as it later turns out, americans) towards jews or hitler. which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? the dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. howard campbell jr. (nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. <br /><br />there are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clich'es (like the song white christmas), that make it real different from average american movies. i recommend it to everyone who is bored with hollywood spy movies.
