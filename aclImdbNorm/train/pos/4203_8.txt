this is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by sam fuller in the early 1950s. this minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual for his earlier films--a cast with some stars. richard widmark, jean peters and richard kiley star in this film about a group of communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of america--and they'll stop at nothing to succeed.<br /><br />the film starts with peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents. they know she is a link in a long espionage chain. unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation--a small-time pickpocket (widmark) is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that peters is carrying. widmark thinks it's just another purse he's ransacked--only later does he realize the seriousness of what he's stolen. now it's widmark on his own--with commies and the fbi hot on his trail.<br /><br />widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish. although she didn't get top billing, a special mention should be made of thelma ritter. this supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon. seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and i was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady.<br /><br />as far as the script and directing go, they are very good--but with one small exception. at first, i loved the way widmark and peters interacted. it's one of the few times on film you'll see a woman punched square in the mouth! now that's tough. later, inexplicably, they become amazingly close--too close to be believable. still, with so much great drama and such an effective noir-like film, this can be overlooked. see this film.
