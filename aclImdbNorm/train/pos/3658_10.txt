this film is like an allegory of the gospel. it has such direct honesty and innocence you can not possibly believe it was made after the world war when italy was ravaged and devastated, and was filled with a huge homeless, impoverished population. it is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as to the endless creative resources of that land of inspiration. <br /><br />toto is a character like doestoevisky's "idiot", a modern christ finding his way in a big city. he is goodness and purity fortified by love, and his acts change the people he encounters, as much as the miracle working dove. the story is told in a natural manner and simple style, yet imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of fellini's surrealist fantasies. it is one of the most inspiring, uplifting movies ever made.
