in this muppet movie, kermit, miss piggy, fozzie, gonzo, rowlf, scooter, camillia, dr. teeth, floyd, animal, janice, and zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical, manhattan melodies, to broadway. unfortunately, no producer will even meet with the muppets. after being denied by too many producers, scooter suggests that the muppets decide to move on on their own. however, kermit still believes that he can get his show on broadway, but after he finally does and let's everybody know that he sold the show, kermit get's amnesia and the others don't know where he is.<br /><br />this features many great scenes, including a live action sequence that introduced the muppet babies, a wedding sequence filled with muppets, including the sesame street cast and traveling matt (from fraggle rock), scooter as a movie theatre usher, and a scene where rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast.<br /><br />my only complaint is that more characters weren't included more. sure, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should have been some significant roles for bunsen, beaker, beauregard, and sweetums, and lips should have been part of the electric mayhem in this movie like he was in the muppet show's last season and the great muppet caper, and miss piggys dog foo foo should have been with her as well (after all, rizzo the rat, also performed by steve whitmire, had a big part in this movie, and he wasn't very well-known at the time).
