the running man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even.<br /><br />my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks.<br /><br />in todays climate of tv media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary, post 1980s-boom. forget that though! there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film.<br /><br />schwarzenegger is on top form as ben "the butcher of bakersfield" richards, and the inclusion of bond-belting one liners was completely inspired-thety are truly leg-end-dary (with his rant to killian over a camera the main highlight).<br /><br />the design of the stalkers is authentically american, and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc 'gladiators' tv show, and the wwe as well. buzz-saw's grisly end will chill any viewer to the core (as a foot note, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour?)<br /><br />jesse venturer and sven ole thorssen are great as backing muscle (and are arnies buds in real life), and its even got mick fleetwood in it too! what more could you ask for?<br /><br />i highly recommend the running man if you're looking for a great piece of entertaining action, with a glossty finish and some great characters. just don't expect an education from it (at least on surface value).<br /><br />quality, i bloody love it actually. you will too unless you're a thesp. 7/10
