"hollywood hotel" is a fast-moving, exuberant, wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from warners which is sadly overlooked. it should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of tinseltown -- "hooray for hollywood." the score by richard whiting and johnny mercer has a number of other gems, however, including the charming "i'm like a fish out of water," and "silhouetted in the moonlight." the best musical number is "let that be a lesson to you," in which dick powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves "behind the eight-ball," a fate which literally befalls slow-burning edgar kennedy at the number's end. the picture celebrates hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once, as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives. the cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians--allyn joslyn as a crafty press agent, ted healy as dick powell's would-be manager, fritz feld as an excitable restaurant patron, glenda farrell as mona marshall's sarcastic gal friday, edgar kennedy as a put-upon drive-in manager, mabel todd as mona's goofy sister, and hugh herbert as her even goofier dad. the "racist" element mentioned in another review here is a ten-second bit where herbert appears in black-face during a pseudo-"gone with the wind" sequence. it's in questionable taste, but it shouldn't prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film, notably the benny goodman quartet (including teddy wilson and lionel hampton!) in what i believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo. the "dark eyes" sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late, but otherwise "hollywood hotel" is a gem, well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for dvd release.
