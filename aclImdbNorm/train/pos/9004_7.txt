i had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication. and it's still not at the top of my list. but the performances from helena bonham carter and kenneth branagh and exemplary, almost stunning, and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker. carter's depiction of an als victim is strong, perhaps even overdone at times (sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings). but the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance.<br /><br />
