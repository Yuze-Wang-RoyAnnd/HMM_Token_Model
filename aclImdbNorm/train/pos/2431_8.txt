famous was "famous" for their tension and release style of cartoon where the semi-main character is in terrible peril, only to be rescued by the hero at the last second. this particular casper is the only one i can remember where death actually takes a hand. but even in death, there is still a happy ending.<br /><br />the constant in famous studios cartoons is that "virtue always triumphs". popeye always gets to his spinach in time, baby huey always out-foxes the fox, little audery always "learns her lesson". and some fs cartoons are really dark and depressing.<br /><br />you have to give them credit. as much as i love looney tunes and "tom and jerry" i don't think anyone was putting out a better cartoon product at that time than paramount. color, animation, music (the great winston sharples), editing, voices. they were consistent and a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer.
