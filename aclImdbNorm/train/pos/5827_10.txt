this three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick "disorder in the court". this is an uproar of laughter for any three stooges fan to enjoy.<br /><br />the boys are janitors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely christine mcintyre sings a great version of "voices of spring". she is going to be offered a record deal, but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer. when she and the others leave the studio, the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress curly up as christine. the contract lady who can make christine's career, sees curly and mistakes him for christine and invites curly to sing for her party. of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd, so he'll find a way to get back at them.<br /><br />what a great stooge flick, this should not be missed! <br /><br />10/10
