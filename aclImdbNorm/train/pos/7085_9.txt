i just bought the dvd and i must say, (after seeing brazil and fear an loathing in las vegas) terry does it again. as well of being a fan of the monty python movies, terry gilliam's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller, whom bruce willis plays a wonderful role as james cole, and as well (perhaps my favorite character) brad pitt who played the insanity of jefferey goines. a must have for sci fi fans, or movie fan of any type really, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. <br /><br />any way the plot, in the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race, which is unleashed in the past by "the army of twelve monkeys". james cole( bruce willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease, so scientists in his time can find a cure. before i go further, james cole lives in an underground society, and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans. anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus. during his stay he meets jefferey goins( brad pitt) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race. he also meets his psychiatrist ((madelein stowe) who eventually teams up with bruce to save the world ( as she sees that he is correct in his tellings), he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax, where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus( not actually brad pitt) and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away.
