the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking peeps sitting in individual cells, waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair.<br /><br /> then our "hero", who is called tenshu, is taken to the chair, he's zapped, and then....he's still "alive". aha ! he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool : either we zap you until we've made sure you're actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you". our hero says yes to option 2, and then the actual story commences.<br /><br /> he wakes up in a different sort of cell (very high-tech and very big), where he finds another cell-mate, who also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride. a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish, as long as it happens within that room. sounds a little suspicious, but the two men accept : what else can they do ?<br /><br /> what these two men do not know is that they have been set together, so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them. basically the unknown scientists in the background p**s them off until they decide that they should kill each other. sounds weird ? indeed, but there's a greater purpose to all of this. this is the part which should not be revealed, and so it shall remain unrevealed.<br /><br /> but fear not, it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo-action movie, fore it has an entirely different approach to the question : how long time can you stand being with a man who's an s.o.b. and would you kill him to obtain freedom ?<br /><br /> the first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest, it sneaks up without you actually knowing it. then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrix-like action fight-scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon.<br /><br /> the movie is indeed very special, so special that normal cinemas won't view it under normal circumstances. however, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic, and the actors do their bit (some more than others) to make the movie truly unique.<br /><br /> if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it, watch it, and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash.<br /><br />
