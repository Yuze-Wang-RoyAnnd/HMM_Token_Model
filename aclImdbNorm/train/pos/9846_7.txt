ok, at the beginning it looked like "shrek" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. and the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (manny's past, for example). the premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. as i said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. the real letdown is the animation. this wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. the humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of cgi before. but don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, "ice age" is commendable. and it will gather many fans, i have no doubt. oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are priceless, and show-stealing.
