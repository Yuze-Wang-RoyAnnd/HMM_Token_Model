always enjoy the great acting of drew barrymore and her great performance in this film, where she plays a very very complicated young gal,(holly gooding),"skipped parts",2000, who leaves new york and travels to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer, george newbern,(patrick highsmith),"far harbor",'96. many strange things start to happen to holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father. if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of drew barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture. if it was not for the good acting of drew barrymore and george newbern, this film should be seen only on halloween night! however, it sure has it's surprises in the end!!!!
