"night of the living homeless" was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season 11. obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably dawn of the dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains.<br /><br />kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house. more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park, until the town is completely overrun with them. this is a very strong randy marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center. but before randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming "i don't have any change!!" unfortunately, the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change.<br /><br />the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. however, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies. this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in "fantastic easter special" two weeks ago.<br /><br />meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem, the property values have nosedived, thus the bank has foreclosed on his house, making him homeless. randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head. when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, randy pulls the trigger.<br /><br />in evergreen, the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park, and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. the boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica, california.<br /><br />the zombie movie parallels and the great randy marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10
