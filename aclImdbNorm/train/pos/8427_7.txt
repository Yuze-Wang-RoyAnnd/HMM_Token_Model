this is one of the oddest films of the zat^oichi series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that ichi plays in the film. interestingly enough, this was the first zat^oichi film made by shintaro katsu's new production company. now, instead of just playing the blind swordsman, katsu is in charge of making the films. this could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films. as far as ichi's role, the film is very different because he isn't in the film as much as usual. he's also easy to fool and actually, for a while, does a lot to harm people instead of helping! <br /><br />"zat^oichi r^oyaburi" begins with ichi talking with an old lady who tries to take advantage of his blindness. oddly, in this scene, ichi says that he's been blind since a toddler, though in an earlier film he says his blindness set in when he was 8. this is a minor mistake, and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed.<br /><br />this film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a year--so you can see what i said about odd pacing. most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks. ichi comes to a town where there is a boss (asagoro) who tries very hard to be nice to ichi because he knows of the blind man's reputation. the boss is quite charming and surprisingly ichi is totally taken in by the evil man. at the same time, he meets another boss (shushui)--a sort of guru to the poor. shushui admonishes the people to forsake all violence and even ichi falls under his teaching--giving up his blade for many months. shushui's teachings are very similar to daoist teachings from china--non-violence and acceptance of life as it is (for good or for bad). <br /><br />months after leaving this town and thinking all was well, ichi learns that as soon as he left, asagoro showed his true colors--enslaving women, oppressing the poor and being an all-around jerk. in a way, ichi is responsible for this, as he helped asagoro and counted him as a friend. now, asagoro has captured shushui and several innocent people have killed themselves due to the evil boss' actions.<br /><br />when ichi returns, he doesn't accept automatically that asagoro is good or evil but tests him cleverly. this bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale where, what else, ichi kills the baddies and frees shushui. this finale was very good and occurred in the rain. then final scene with asagoro and the rocks is great, though the beheading is a tad cheesy by today's special effects standards.<br /><br />pluses for the film are that although poorly paced, it is different and cannot be mistaken for the previous 15 (which often seem very similar). additionally, it does end very well. minuses (aside from pacing) are that some might dislike seeing ichi so fallible and the scenes with ichi and the other blind men that are included for comic relief fall flat...very, very, very flat. they are tacky and unfunny...that's the sort of flat that it is.
