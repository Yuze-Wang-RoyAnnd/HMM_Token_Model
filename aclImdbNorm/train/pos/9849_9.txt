when i saw the trailers i just had to see the film. and when i had, i kinda had a feeling that felt like unsatisfied. it was a great movie, don't get me wrong, but i think the great parts where already in the trailers, if you catch my drift. it went very fast and it rolled on, so i was never bored, and i enjoyed watching it. the humor was absolutely great. my first contact with a sloth (..or something like it).
