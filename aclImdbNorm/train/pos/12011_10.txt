i am stunned at the negative comments that i have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest. this is the most moving and real portrayal of joseph smith that i have ever seen. it was well acted to the point that at times i forgot that i was watching a movie. it brought joseph's life of hardship, good-natured optimism, enduring faith in people and god, and ultimate sacrifice to life such in a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in awe. if anyone, of any christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way--i would have to say it is a reflection of the individual and not the movie. i give the movie a "10" and encourage honest souls to view it. at the very least it is an extremely heart felt portrayal of man who gave everything he had for what he believed...in a world where values and beliefs are ridiculed, this movie stands as a enduring reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be- no matter what religious beliefs we hold.- ann pruitt-
