i am amazed that movies like this can still be made. i watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen. never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on.<br /><br />washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays creasy, a washed-up ex-counter-terrorist agent who's taken to the bottle. once he's assigned to protect young pita (dakota fanning) in mexico city, his emotional and redemptive arc is jump-started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide. inevitably, pita is kidnapped by thugs, and creasy decides that most of mexico city must pay the price for daring to take away his character's teddy-bear-clutching catalyst. yes, he has become...a man on fire. <br /><br />you must see this movie.
