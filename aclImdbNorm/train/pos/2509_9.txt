vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. who could ask for more? moon child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick! gackt is the innocent sho - who befriends a vampire kei (hyde), their relationship grows with time but as sho ages, kei's immortality breaks his heart. it doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman. the special effects are pretty good considering the small budget. it's a touching story ripe with human emotions. you will laugh, cry, laugh, then cry some more. even if you are not a fan of their music, see this film. it works great as a stand alone vampire movie.<br /><br />9 out of 10
