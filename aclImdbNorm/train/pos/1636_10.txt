this is one of the greatest 80s movies!!! it sticks out like a "turd in a punchbowl"!! i can't believe mad magazine denounced it or whatever. and yet, they proudly put their name on a show with "stuart", "i-speak-a-no-enlish chinese lady" and "ups guy on speed". what's up with that? and, i love ron leibman-he's foxy!! wonder why he had his name removed from the credits? it was his funniest role that i know of. of course, he's not nearly as foxy as he was in norma rae. but, in my opinion, this movie is right up there with national lampoon's vacation. if you liked movies such as porky's, fast times, last american virgin, or any of the other 80s teen-focused movies, you'll love this one!! rent it and you'll see what i mean!!
