my all-time favorite movie. oscar-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera. the screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel. the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment. it is josie lawrence's best work by far, and transformed my opinion of joan plowright. having watched this movie at least 50 times, i can find no fault in it. the music, by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel.
