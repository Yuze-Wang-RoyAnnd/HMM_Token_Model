ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all times. believe me i saw a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one make you smile every time you watching it. but truth is that the humour in this comedy is special.it is caratherisic for serbia. and all former republic of yugoslavia know it very well!!! so i think the rest of audience (for example: in europe)can't enjoy it so much. because the subtitles ruin the hole thing. but they should at least try!!!! yes it is ironic! this is the best flick in serbian history and the world doesn't understand it! :-) if you have got a chance to see this one, don't blew up ok!
