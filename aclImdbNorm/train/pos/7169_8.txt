typically, "kids" films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13. but then again, that's before holes hit the scene. sure, it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. the acting was decent, and the uneasy dynamics that stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray. what i especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry. the emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine, kind of like the shawshank redemption in many ways (which holes also has a similar, redemptive ending to it). the only down side? the hokey looking lizards. overall, however, an 8/10.
