dig! i would say to anyone even if you don't like metallica to see 'some kind of monster' it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts. it's fun and fascinating. along the same lines comes dig! a film about 'the dandy warhol's' and 'the brian jonestown massacre' two portland bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the wayside into the musical history books. right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad. filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the dandy's meteoric rise to fame (thanks to that vodaphone ad!) and the jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes. as the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights. all of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is perversely watch able. like i said at the beginning you can watch the metallica film even if you have no interest in the band. dig! on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band. still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than encouraging that as a career path. dig! is a mad ride on rock and roll's coat tails and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous.
