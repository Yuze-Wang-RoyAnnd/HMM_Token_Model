in the sequel to the brilliant bill and ted's excellent adventure, bill and ted are under threat from the future, as the evil chuck de nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as bill and ted to earth to kill human bill and ted, in order to change the future.<br /><br />in a great comedy pairing, winter and reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel. though lacking the sharpness of the first, bogus journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention an hilarious performance by william sadler, who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. watch for the games sequences, the best moment in the entire film, but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre.<br /><br />though still packed with humour, this film has a more dramatic film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more risky. <br /><br />this gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature. the creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot. the fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.<br /><br />the first watch i hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor, bogus journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film.
