father of the pride was the best new show to hit television since family guy. it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation. like the simpsons, the show centers around a nuclear family (of white lions, in this case). it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the surly orangutan, vincent the italian-american flamingo, the eccentric white tigers blake and victoria, the faux patriotic snout brothers and chutney the elephant. the other stars of the show are the sigfreid and roy. they are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner, making the most mundane activities entertaining. the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues (drugs, prejudice, etc) is the source of the program's brilliance.<br /><br />the blame for this show's failure lies with nbc. they opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order (perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote) rather than the more logical production order. several times, the show was preempted for an extra half-hour of such dreck as the biggest loser (as if 60 minutes of that was not enough)! it is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while fear factor and american idol dominate.<br /><br />luckily, the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following. 10/10
