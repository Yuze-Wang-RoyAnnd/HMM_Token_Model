really, i think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film. in fact, the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining.<br /><br />yes, the script is a little convoluted, but that's the genre. the film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. just like all the old noir classics, this, too, has a screenplay that twists you around so that you don't always know how to make sense of it at first, and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together. that's the genre. in general, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and, in turn, surprised, without abandoning the viewer.<br /><br />sharon stone is also an easy target. the truth is she looks great and she speaks her double-entendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious, sexy and fun.<br /><br />the direction is more than passable, because let's face it--you have to keep an audience interested in the "did she or didn't she?" question for two hours. in addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by stone, this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines to go along with stone's sexy curves. the frame is always beautiful--press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye.<br /><br />the film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real, particularly the sex. "katherine tramell is bisexual...how shocking!" becomes treated more matter-of-factly here, and typically, the sexuality of the film is used to better effect. it is still titillating, but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first. i won't say that it isn't still somewhat of a gimmick because, let's face it, this film is supposed to be fun.<br /><br />and a fun film it is. it may be an easy target, but if you watch it for what it is: a noirish, femme-fatale driven, twisty, sexy, did-she-or-didn't-she who-dunnit, you're bound to enjoy it (no pun intended).
