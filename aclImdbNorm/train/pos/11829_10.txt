i've been watching "dick tracy" for years, and as a result it's become a vital part of my life - it was with me throughout childhood and i used to see it quite often. seeing it now, as an adult, it's still a very good movie - dark, satiric and incredibly misunderstood. about the only thing that can be said is the oscar nomination pacino received - other than that it is rarely discussed and didn't make much of a fuss when it came out.<br /><br />pacino is over-the-top but to good effect as he's clearly having loads of fun. beatty is great as dick tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film, possibly, i have ever seen. just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking. the lighting, velvet overtones and smog/smoke combine to create a great effect.<br /><br />there are some really funny cameos including one by dustin hoffman as "mumbles," and i don't think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting - even the mandatory kid-character is far better than expected.<br /><br />overall, a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5.7/10 average on imdb. the critics' reviews are very positive (check out rottentomatoes.com) and after seeing the film once again it's not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book, from style to eccentricity.<br /><br />highly recommended. 4.5/5 stars.
