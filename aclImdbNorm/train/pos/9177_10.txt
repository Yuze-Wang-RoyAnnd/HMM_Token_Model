i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "jane eyre". both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane. i've seen other versions, but none compare to this one. the best one for me. i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again. the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13. at that time, i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte bronte's novel. i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes. i'd like to see it again because it's so good. :-)
