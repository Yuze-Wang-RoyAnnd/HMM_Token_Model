this movie is good. it's not the best of the great cg kung fu flicks but its pretty good. first thing first, the story is actually good. the whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool. my problem is theres too many characters! it got very confusing when they switched scenes! the special effects were incredible! the fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex. this movie practically all computer generated. the acting is superb, as always expected from such high profile players. ekin cheng makes an excellent protagonist, loner character. zhang ziyi did nothing for me in this movie. i thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping. the bad guy, the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening. the music is also excellent. to me this story deserve at least a mini-series and not just one movie. theres too much story to cram in 2 hours. maybe if there was a book or something, i would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details. this movie sacrifices story integrity for action. i reccomend storm riders over this any day.
