because of all the negative reviews of this film i almost didn't watch it. however, i was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie. the acting wasn't great - apart from the wonderful alice krige - but some of the dialogue ("just consider yourself lunch.") was quite amusing.<br /><br />on the whole an above average stephen king effort - 7/10.
