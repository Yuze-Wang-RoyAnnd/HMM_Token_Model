love this film also. saw it when it was first shown i8n germany in a small independent cinema in frankfurt. it was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to. the erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with moritz boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that. in his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie.<br /><br />it doesn't exist much copies of that film, mortitz boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for tv as well before he became a sort of therapist.<br /><br />for the people who wish to see that movie again, you could find it on his homepage which isn't that easy to search for but its possible.
