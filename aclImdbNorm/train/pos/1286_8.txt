this familiar story of an older man/younger woman is surprisingly hard-edged. bikers, hippies, free love and jail bait mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black-and-white indie effort. lead actress patricia wymer, as the titular "candy," gives the finest performance of her career (spanning all of 3 drive-in epics). wymer was precocious and fetching in the young graduates (1971), but gives a more serious performance in the babysitter. the occasional violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising, but well-handled by the director. leads wymer and george e. carey sell the may/december romance believably. there are enough similarities between the babysitter and the young graduates to make one wonder if the same director helmed the latter film as well. patricia wymer, where are you?<br /><br />hailing from seattle, wa, miss wymer had appeared as a dancer on the tv rock and roll show malibu u, before gracing the cover (as well as appearing in an eight-page spread) of the august, 1968 issue of "best for men," a tasteful adults-only magazine. she also appeared as a coven witch in the popular 1969 cult drive-in shocker the witchmaker.<br /><br />the babysitter has finally made its home video debut, as part of the eight-film bci box set drive-in cult classics vol. 3, which is available from amazon.com and some retail stores such as best buy.
