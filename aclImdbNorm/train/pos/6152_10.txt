fabulous, fantastic, probably disney's best musical adventure. i have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative, clever and fun. even despite the silly "flying bed" scenes, the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny. could they have picked anyone better than angela lansbury to play eglantine? i cannot think of anyone more suited to the role. remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking mary poppins.<br /><br />david tomlinson, though he had few quality movie roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. he was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays. blustering, prim and proper englishman -- nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does. it would be tragic to remake this film because tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice.<br /><br />the dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just don't capture. i particularly enjoy the parts where the germans invade eglantine's house and she must defend it in any way she can.<br /><br />bobbing along, bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny, sea. richard and robert sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers. all of them are fantastic and worth remembering, portobello road being one of my favorites.<br /><br />a great film that still holds up today!!
