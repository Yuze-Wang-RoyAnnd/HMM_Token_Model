this is arguably john thaw's finest performance where he successfully shakes off any traits of his inspector morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of tom from the pages of the book to the tv screen. this is a well made production which maintains its family viewing vibe despite some very mature themes like the outbreak of the second world war and the physical abuse suffered by the child.<br /><br />however it is the relationship between tom and young willie that is the heart and soul of this story. it is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy evacuated from london and the grumpy old man he is left with develop - a real grandfather/grandson connection.<br /><br />it is a pity that this story wasn't made with a bigger budget with a more established director as it belongs on the big screen, not shown once or twice every ten years on a sunday afternoon. given the right guidance, john thaw would be celebrated the world over and bestowed with many awards for his brilliant performance in this movie. a great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at the time.
