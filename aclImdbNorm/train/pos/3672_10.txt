a mock documentary about a pair of canadian producers, bobby myers (matthew modine) and paul linder (saul rubinek), trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. hollywood north is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together, despite a number of conflicting threads.<br /><br />hollywood north works as a film in a way very similar to why this is spinal tap (1984) works so well. namely, although exaggerated in some ways, it is very close to the truth, and the truth consists of "behind the scenes" facts that are very different than the public face of the industry. it isn't easy to make a film, and it must have been especially difficult in canada in the late 1970s. films involve tens, if not hundreds, of people. many have incompatible desires, motivations and personalities. especially crucial are the financiers and the on-screen talent, as if either drops out or becomes undependable at any stage while the film is in production, it could jeopardize the whole affair, either necessitating extensive reshoots or abandoning the film altogether.<br /><br />so it's not surprising that hollywood north focuses on those kinds of relationships. the result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. the script is flawless and the performances are top notch. this is a must-see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film-making. it should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor.<br /><br />a 10 out of 10 from me.
