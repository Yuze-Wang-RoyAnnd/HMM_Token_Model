on the night of his bachelor party, paul coleman (jason lee) meets the gorgeous dancer becky (julia stiles) in the bar, they drink a lot together and in the next morning, he wakes up with her on the bed. his future mother-in-law calls him and informs that his fianc'ee karen (selma blair) might be arriving in his apartment, and he desperately asks becky to leave his place in a hurry. sooner, he finds that her has crabs, and later, in the preparation of his wedding dinner party, he realizes that becky is the cousin of karen. this is the beginning of a very funny comedy, with hilarious situations. the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor. julia stiles and selma blair, who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous, and jason lee, who is amazingly funny, have good performances. i laughed a lot along the story, but there are some scenes that are really hilarious. for example, when paul finds becky in his bed; when he finds her paints; his imagination in many situations; in the drugstore, trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine; most of the scenes of his neighbor, the minister; when karen calls the department store; or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting paul. i could number many other scenes, but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil):"louco por elas" ("crazy for them")
