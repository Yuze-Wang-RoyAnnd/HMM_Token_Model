this movie is one of the many "kung fu" action films made in asia in the late '70s - early '80s, full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action. but unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy. when workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by manchu bullies, they hire a con-artist (gordon liu) to try to scare them off. when his attempt fails miserably, he cons his way into a shaolin temple to learn to fight for real. but instead of making him a kung-fu student, the master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. well, it turns out that while he's performing these menial tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles) that he's learning the skills to be a kung-fu expert! it's sort of like in karate kid when mr. miagi teaches daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores- "wax on, wax off" et cetera. there's lots of great comedy from beginning to end, and plenty of action at the end when gordon liu once again faces his manchu tormentors. "this time it's not just tricks- it's the real thing!" liu declares, proudly thumping his chest. if you like classic kung fu films you don't want to miss this one!
