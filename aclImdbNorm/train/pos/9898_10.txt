my 10/10 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked "slaughter high" even before watching it. yes, it's the typical revenge-several-years-after-a-dirty-prank story, but how can you not like some of the stuff that they pull here?! i couldn't have predicted that bathtub scene in a million years.<br /><br />ok, so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new. well, it doesn't pretend to. it's the sort of flick that the characters in "scream" probably watched, and it contributed to their rules about how to survive a horror movie. after all, who doesn't like to watch people suffer for doing these things? obviously, it's got sort of a reactionary undertone, as people get punished for doing what the '60s championed. but still, you gotta love this stuff! so, with apologies to don mclean, this jester didn't sing for the king and queen!
