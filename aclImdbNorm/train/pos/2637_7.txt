this is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first lion king, but that said, this was downright good.<br /><br />my kids loved this, but that's a given, they love anything that's a cartoon. the big shock was that *i* liked it too, it was laugh out loud funny at some parts (even the fart jokes*), had lots of rather creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being risqu'e like in shrek ["do you think he's compensating for something?"]).<br /><br />a special note on the fart jokes, i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises/imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup/punchline/etc, and were almost in good taste. i'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in those regards.<br /><br />hmm what else? the music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, but plenty of fun for the kids. no painfully corny moments, which was a blessing for me. a little action but nothing too scary (the secret of nimh gave my kids nightmares, not sure a g rating was appropriate for that one...)<br /><br />all in all i'd say this is a great movie for kids of any age, one that's 100% safe to let them watch (i try not to be overly sensitive but i've had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room during this one. i'd say stick around anyway though, you might find that you enjoy it too :)
