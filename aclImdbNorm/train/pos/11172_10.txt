personally, i absolutely love this movie and novel(i read the book first and decided to see the movie). first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind. the acting is also great and i love the cast. judd crandall (plays fred gwynne) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. there are also a few corny lines thrown in there (idk if they were meant to be corny), but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh. the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie. not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again, i recommend this 100% to any horror fan!!
