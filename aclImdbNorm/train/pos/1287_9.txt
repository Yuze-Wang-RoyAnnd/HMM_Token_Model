"let's bowl" started out on local television in the twin cities. it came on late at night, something you'd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of hamm's.<br /><br />even the ads were locally produced, featuring wally outside grumpy's bar, holding a microphone and stammering nervously -- "ahh...over to you, steve sedahl." not sure why, but that one always made me laugh.<br /><br />there was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips. sedahl played it straight, counter-balanced by rich kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious "wally hotvedt." highlights included segments like "how to properly dispose of an old bowling ball" (chuck them into a lake) and "tips on dating," where the duo "date" a couple of hookers and wally ends with the bitter complaint, "i could have done that myself!" <br /><br />another segment -- what the duo did on their days off -- featured steve in beer can strewn hovel, pigging out from the fridge while wally struggled to climb the cliffs at taylor's falls, dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over-sized headphones. hilarious! <br /><br />wally's awestruck comments about "league bowlers," and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights.<br /><br />"let's bowl" was picked up by comedy central and had some good moments, but the network never really knew what to do with it, running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling "competition," which was never the point of the show. the constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters (ernie, the pig, butch, etc.) were more distractions than anything else. the whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced. even jon stewart dissed let's bowl on the daily show -- (not enough lame, snide jokes?) -- an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better.<br /><br />how often does a "let's bowl" come along in the world of modern television, a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap? the networks have the "total crap" part down cold, but it's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark, strange, funny little gem like "let's bowl." <br /><br />here's hoping they'll put it out on dvd.
