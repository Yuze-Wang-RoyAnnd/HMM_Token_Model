one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in american history began. the members of the summer of love culture, at the end of the seventies and onset of the 80's, were eventually tool old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life, whatever that meant. for those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, their's was the culture of wonderland. a love for drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with a distaste for authority, values and "the establishment" is the world that the film captures. <br /><br />the sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore the american "house" apart. once the battles were over, we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage. the characters in the wonderland house are icons of the misfits of the seventies; part biker, part hippie, part crook, all outcast. no ideology to express, just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and allegiance to nothing. ron, billy and david fancy themselves as some sort of robin hoods with dope. they talk of love and behave violently; they take from the rich and sell to the misbegotten; they steal from everyone.<br /><br />holmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of anti-matter like sex, and drugs and rock & roll, when the lab technicians get bored and move on. <br /><br />the film is skillfully directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the drug fiends in their element. the fact that holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. that story was told in "boogie nights". this is a story of a transitional and forgettable era.
