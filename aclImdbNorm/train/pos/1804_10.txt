first things first, i was never once scared of this underrated gem as a kid ("little mermaid" on the other hand...). as my title says this was one of my fav childhood movies that i still love as a teenager. it's a beautiful, bittersweet movie about a misfit german shepherd called charlie (fantasticaly voiced by burt reynolds) who is killed by his boss/partner in crime (is name ha,ha is carface). charlie is sent straight to heaven by default because "all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind". chalie gets sent back to earth 'cause he winded up his life clock where he gets into even more mischief with his best friend, itchy and a little orphan girl, anne-marie. i used to watch this all the time as a kid and i still sometimes watch it. anyways, it's a beautiful bittersweet film as i said before that might just leave a tear in your eye...
