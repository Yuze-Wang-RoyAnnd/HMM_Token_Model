this was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television. its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs. the actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point. although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six, it was still funny. season 8 was the real problem kicked in. without topher grace or ashton kutcher the show simply fell apart. not too say, the other actors weren't great if any of 2 main characters had left such as danny masterson, wilder valderamma kurtwood smith, debra jo rupp, mila kunis and laura prepon ( don starks and tommy chong are great too) left the show it would have the same affect. and the inclusion of randy ( josh meyers) didn't help either because he was not well received by the shows fans. i believe if the show ended a year ago it would have certainly gone down in history as one of the sitcom greats. season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent. i am going to miss the show, i just hope i wake up one day to find out the show is back as that 80's show with the same cast because i am going to miss the hell out of it.
