mating game is a charming, wonderful movie from an era gone by. hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie. my wife and i would go see it.<br /><br />it is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and i watched on amc.<br /><br />this movie has tony randall at his best. debbie reynolds is great, as always. <br /><br />loved it. we plan on ordering on dvd to add to our growing collection of movies.<br /><br />too bad hollywood does not make movies like this anymore.<br /><br />hey hollywood....time to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe, update them a bit (without spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes), and hold a casting call.<br /><br />a remake would be a big hit on the silver screen, dvd, and on cable/sattv.<br /><br />sn austin, tx
