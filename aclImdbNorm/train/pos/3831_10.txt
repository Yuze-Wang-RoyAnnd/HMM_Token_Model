this an free adaptation of the novels of clarence mulford; fans of the willaim boyd films will probably feel a little at sea here (and the reviews here so far reflect that). but i knew of hopalong from the novels first, and never cared much for the boyd films once i got around to them.<br /><br />christopher coppola has made a wise choice - he has not made a nostalgic "western"; instead, he has approached the cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call 'americana'; or what older critics once called 'homespun'. as the film unraveled, i found myself more and more reminded of the great "hallmark theater" version of mark twain's "roughing it", with james garner narrating.<br /><br />both these films remind us that, although films about the 'old west' are probably always to be mythic for americans, they need not be 'westerns'; they can very well be just films about what it meant to be american in that time, in that place.<br /><br />i never feel pandered to, watching this film; there's no effort to shove the boyd-cassidy legacy down our throats, no irony, no camp. consequently, i get a sense of these characters as having walked - or ridden horseback - across some real western america i too could have walked a hundred years ago.<br /><br />given that, the plainness of the film - it positively avoids anything we have come to call "style" - is all to its favor; and the plain acting of the performers fits neatly in with this; gosh, it really does feel like some story told around a campfire on a cattle drive - no visual dressing, just the quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn. i was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and if the viewer sets aside encultured expectations, he or she will find considerable pleasure in it.<br /><br />i would have given this film 9-stars, but i'll give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely; and i urge them to set their memories of boyd aside and give this film another chance.<br /><br />note 1: a reviewer complained that hopalong shoots people dead in this film, rather than shooting the guns out of their hands (ala boyd's cassidy); first, cassidy does shoot people dead in the novels; second, if cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot people dead - the problem with shooting guns out of people's hands is that they can always get another gun - which happens to be part of the subtext of this very film.<br /><br />note 2: i admit that i am jealous of the coppola family, that they have the director of "the godfather" among them who can get them all opportunities to make movies that i can't; but a good movie is a good movie; and this is a good movie. if it's by somebody by the name "coppola", well, that's just is as it is. america is the land of opportunity (or was, until bush got into office) - that's what the great american novels are all about.
