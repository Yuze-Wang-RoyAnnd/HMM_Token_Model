the brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary. it's one of man's primal fears. this movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room. corbin bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who i guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it's not really working out. in a particularly gory scene we find so-so actor earl boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot, which i guess is the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist. it's a typical brian yuzna situation, not well written but there's gore. the plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we've all thought of it but they did it first.
