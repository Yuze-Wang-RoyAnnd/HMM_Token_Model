this show is quick-witted, colorful, dark yet fun, hip and still somehow clean. the cast, including an awesome rotation of special guests (i.e. molly shannon, paul rubens, the-stapler-guy-from-office-space) is electric. it's got murder, romance, family, and zombies without ever coming off as cartoony... somehow. you really connect with these characters. the whole production is an unlikely magic act that left me, something of a skeptic if i do say so myself, totally engrossed and coming back for more every wednesday night. i just re-read this and it sounds a little like somebody paid me to write it. it really is that good. i just heard a rumor that it was being canceled so i thought i'd send off a flare of good will. this is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. do yourself a huge favor, if you haven't already, and enjoy this gem while it lasts. ok so one more thing. this show is clever. what that means is that every armchair critic/"writer" in hollywood is gonna insert a stick up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with an "i could've written that" type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated hollywood hotel room. in other words: the internet. this is a general interest/anonymous website. before you give your wednesday tv hour to dirty sexy money or next hot model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet "critics" aren't commenting on, give my fave' show a spin. it's fun. good, unpretentious fun.
