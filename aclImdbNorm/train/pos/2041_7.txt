"creep" is a new horror film that, without a doubt, will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and unscrupulous! it has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. what it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that didn't bother me for one second. when the end-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer christopher smith (in his debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the "creep" in the london subway. the story revolves on the young and haughty kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor george clooney who's in town to present his new film. she falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. even experienced homeless people, security guards or sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! i really dug the creep-character! he's nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. christopher smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background. i reckon this isn't very original, and i'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content, but i forgive smith and i think it's better this way than going over the top completely, "jeepers creepers"-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). the obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! there's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. the ominous setting of the abandoned london subway during night is effectively used. there also is some acting-talent present in this film, with franka potenta (run lola run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool german film "anatomie". creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and christopher smith definitely is a director i'll keep an eye on. make sure you don't have to take the subway right after watching this film...
