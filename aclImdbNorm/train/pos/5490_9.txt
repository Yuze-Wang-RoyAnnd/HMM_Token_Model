this really is an incredible film. not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the united states up for its dishonesty, subterfuge, and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. these filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before.<br /><br />and in the cross hairs we see the usa, once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality. it's heart-breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by successive american governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens. the footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of tv or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. these irish film makers deserve our gratitude. long live chavez.<br /><br />we need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit. first phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are, and this documentary does a great job of doing just that.
