eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in egypt. really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century. i also didn't realize the series flopped. there is a second season airing now isn't there? it is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either ill-informed or don't watch a show at all. it is a waste of space on the boards and of other's time. the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place, but that is to be expected from any show. the remainder of the first season is excellent. i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states.
