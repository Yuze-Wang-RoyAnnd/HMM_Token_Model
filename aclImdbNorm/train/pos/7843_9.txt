i can't believe that they took this off the air. especially, when they only had a few more episodes left. my daughter, sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show. we were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so called ratings. it is not fair to the people who were watching this show since the beginning. we had a right to see the end. i wish they would take an overall vote from all people with a 3 times a year voting system. they could send out papers in the mail and we as viewers could give an overall vote on all programs that we watch or have heard about. this could also help promote a new show. people would see it and wonder what it is. not only could you see what the viewers are watching, you could also use this as a tool for free advertisement for tv and cable channels. we want to see the other episodes. bring it back!!
