s.s. van dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with hollywood. most of the film series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios. but apparently van dine must have sold his rights to each book about philo vance one at a time. note that paramount, mgm, warner brothers, and more all released philo vance films. only tarzan seemed to get around hollywood more.<br /><br />mgm produced the garden murder case and starred edmund lowe as the fashionable detective. of course mgm had the screen's original philo under contract at the time, but bill powell was busy doing the thin man at the time and i guess louis b. mayer decided to concentrate him there.<br /><br />edmund lowe is a pretty acceptable philo vance. lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with what price glory and then with a string of films with victor mclaglen with their flagg and quirt characters. but after mclaglen got his oscar for the informer, lowe seemed to fade into the b picture market. <br /><br />the garden murder case involves three separate victims, douglas walton, gene lockhart, and frieda inescourt. the sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished.<br /><br />i will say this though. vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of hitchcock.
