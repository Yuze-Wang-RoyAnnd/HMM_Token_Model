john waters has made the most effusively buoyant, heartfelt, dark, personal little film i think i've ever seen (well maybe fast food fast women comes in close second) the directors vision is untainted...the narrative is whimsical, the characters are personal and odd reflections of family and his own inner life ...the tone never forced or stylistically over-arch.<br /><br />there is no pretentious shot design, ennui, or magazine grading....martha plimpton is amazing as the sister..eddie furlong is inspired casting. a grandmother with a talking mary, tea-bagging, recycled clothing, yesterday's garbage becomes today's art -- and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family ... and a humble life.
