felix unger (jack lemmon) has just been dumped by his wife, because he is one of the most annoying , neurotic people in the world. suicide is his way out, but he just can't seem to get it to work, so he heads over to his friends house. oscar madison (walther matthau) is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven. smoking, gambling, hitting on chicks, eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him. well, with the suicide attempts oscar decides to let felix move in. at first, it is a match made in heaven, felix cooks and cleans and helps oscar pay his alimony on time, but soon oscar is jonesing for women and felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) isn't ready to move on. they invite a couple of british birds over and they find felix so tender that soon they and felix are weeping and chatting about his family life, leaving oscar denied. this is it, he explodes and throws him out, but felix isn't as helpless as it seems, and soon he has the upper hand. my favorite quote "you leave me little notes on my pillow. told you 158 times i can't stand little notes on my pillow. "we're all out of cornflakes. f.u." took me three hours to figure out f.u. was felix ungar!" based on a neil simon play (who also wrote the screenplay), this has a certain theatre feel to it. set and the repartee and looks feel quite play-like (for better or worse). lemmon and mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the grumpier old men movies and out to sea, reprising the same finicky/slob roles, but with different names (to avoid royalty issues, i'm sure).<br /><br />this movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. the chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is tart, juicy and bright red (unless you get those nasty greenish ones). they are almost polar opposites, but together, the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /><br />http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
