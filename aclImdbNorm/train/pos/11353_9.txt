this movie was excellent. it details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in russia during the 80's. i give this movie high marks for it's no-holds-barred look into the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated (thanks to the "regime") community. this is a graphic movie. it presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and it's tragic remains. nothing is "candy-coated" with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. this movie is based on russian serial killer andrei chikatilo. i'm familiar enough with the true story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they kept the film. it's not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this movie is a must-see.
