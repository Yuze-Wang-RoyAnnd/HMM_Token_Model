it's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it. i enjoyed it because i wasn't expecting what i was seeing, but an ordinary sex-drama so.... it's a pscyho-sexual thriller, in which nothing is what it seems. it features emmanuelle seigner, no stranger to the genre (and to nudity) in which her husband, polanski, had directed her. and a creepy performance (did i say creepy/yes creepy) from toreton (bernard tavernier's actor). it looks like a pascal bruckner meets roman polanski (better than bitter moon), like a chabrol gone astray or clouzot thriller (i have seen someone mentioning les diaboliques), but closer to georges franju's les yeux sans visage (eyes without a face, the godfather of dr. phibes and more). a gem ! i am just afraid they will blow this into a hollywood remake like they did with nighwatch and the vanishing.
