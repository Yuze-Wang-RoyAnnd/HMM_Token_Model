well, tenko is without doubt the best british television show ever, the performances, the directing, the casting, the suspense, the drama..... everything is fantastic about it.<br /><br />although the show fell a little later in its final season, this ending movie picked up the threads nicely and wove a superb story for fans of the show and newbies. i cannot recommend this movie more, find it and watch it. but i do advise watching the series first, as the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie.<br /><br />an obvious (10/10)
