this is a romantic comedy where albert einstein, played wonderfully by walter matthau, and his cronies play match maker to his niece (meg ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (tim robbins). the interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors. this movie is cute and fun ... a "feel-gooder"! hearty recommendations.
