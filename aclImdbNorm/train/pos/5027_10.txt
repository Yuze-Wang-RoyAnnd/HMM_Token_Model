i gave this movie a 10 because it needed to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors and my god the enging! the thing is i don't want to tell anyone anything about the acting or story because it will ruin the movie. but i will recommend that you go straight to your nearest moviestore right now and rent it! (don't forget popcorn!)
