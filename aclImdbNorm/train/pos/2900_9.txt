should this be an american movie i'd rate it 7: we've seen this before. being this an argentinean movie, and being myself argentine, i'd like to give it a 10, since it's the kind of quality i'd been hoping -rather than expecting- for. it's superb quality is astonishing, given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd world...<br /><br />i can't forget the scene when d'iaz forces silverstein's fianc'e to confess -you know what i mean if you saw the movie. i think that's the key moment of the movie, not surprising maybe, yet original. that's when the real action begins.<br /><br />before watching a movie i always try to gather some previous information. being this a mainstream, satyric, commercial one, i press "play" and make a suspension of reality and logic, i'd say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this. it's impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, yet it's believable in a certain way. as for me, i couldn't stop laughing at every single joke and commentary -"sos malo" ("you're mean")... put in the mouth of d'iaz, the greatest one.<br /><br />i'm rather tired of seeing movies "designed for" peretti. i know he's a superb actor, but sometimes i feel his roles unfairly opaque the rest, luis luque's role in this case. i'm not very fond of argentine television, so i haven't seen much work from luque, but it's pretty obvious that he's an excellent performer. his physical role, his stares, his content attitude in this movie made me fall in love with his performance. i think his role should need some upgrading, just to let him show us how great he can be!<br /><br />i don't know whether szifr'on is planning to make a sequel or not. i know he won't make it if it's to follow the rule that "second parts were never good", so if he makes it, i'll surely go see it. and i hope that, in the future, takes into account the possibility to give peretti's counterparts the same chances to develop their roles.<br /><br />great movie, great performances, and lots of laughs!
