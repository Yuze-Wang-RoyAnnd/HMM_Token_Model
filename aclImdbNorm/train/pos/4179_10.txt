this is the story of australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid. since they are out of uniform, they are, justly, treated as spies. as such, they are tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. the japanese court-martial, out of admiration for their heroism, authorizes that they be given a warrior's death. of course, under the code of bushido, this means that they are to be beheaded. a fate for which, as westerners, they are unprepared.
