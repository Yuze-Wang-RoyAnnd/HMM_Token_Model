i saw brother's shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it! judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son. the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn. he shows up there because his brother has died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives. also, the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
