moon child, starring japanese rockers hyde and gackt, was a better movie then i expected. in fact, i was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies.<br /><br />set in mallepa, the story follows a group of street orphans, sho, sho's brother shinji, and toshi who rob and murder to make a living. on one of robberies, sho encounters hyde's kei vampire burning in the sunlight. through the coarse of events kei's true nature is shown, yet no one shuns him away.<br /><br />the time passes and implies that the immortal, never-changing kei has raised sho, and the two have a an extremely close bond. sho and kei then encounter son in an outrageous gun fight, and they become quick friends. both kei and hyde fall in love with son's sister, yi-che.<br /><br />time skips ahead again and shows a grown sho, this time void of kei. it also explains that sho and son have become enemies.<br /><br />through tragedy after tragedy this movie dives into the reality of life and all it's hardships, focusing on friendship and love. it is a truly touching movie that is sad yet beautiful at the same time.<br /><br />as for the acting, i think gackt did a magnificent job. hyde did an amazing job for a first timer.<br /><br />the shots were beautiful, but the movie did have it's rare and short gruesome shots.<br /><br />all in all, i must say this movie is amazing, moving, and i highly recommend it.
