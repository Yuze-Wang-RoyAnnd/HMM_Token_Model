i think this movie is well done and realistic. i you are used to watching hollywood "action" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. this movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what hollywood can produce, and that is what lifts it above the average action movie. i have no experience with swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. but as i have seen the "making of" extra i'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. this is a movie i will recommend for others to watch. high quality realistic story and movie.
