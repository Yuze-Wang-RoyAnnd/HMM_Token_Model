this film was made in 1943 when i think judy was at her peak (looks wise). in her previous film for me and my gal people often say that she looks emaciated. well in this film she looks perfect. she is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy.<br /><br />i think this film is hilarious, especially at the beginning when she is trying to arrange an audition with john thornway. one of the funniest scene's in my opinion is judy's rendition of lady macbeth and when john is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking (lol).<br /><br />one criticism i do have is that there is a hole in the plot when john and lily fall in love. i mean one minute he despises her and the next they are going out on a date then the next time they meet after that date they are in love.<br /><br />another point i didn't like was on opening night. if i were lily i would be furious with john but she isn't...it just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />but all in all i would have to give this film a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect.
