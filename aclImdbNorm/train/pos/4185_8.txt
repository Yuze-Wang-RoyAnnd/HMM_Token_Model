this movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - sloppy editing, little to no continuity, insane dialog, bad (you might even say non-existent) acting, pointless story lines, shots that go on far too long...and it's perfect for mst3k-style riffing, not to mention the "corpse eaters drinking game": scribble on forms...take a shot - sign your name...take a shot - catch a bad foley edit...take many, many shots.<br /><br />the only reason i didn't rate it higher than 8 is because there's not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness, it's only an hour long - hell, a movie like this should have been at least 20-30 minutes longer!
