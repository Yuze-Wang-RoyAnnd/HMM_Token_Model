the italian is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time. stunningly shot, with lighting effects that are truly sublime, this is an early gem that clearly reveals reginald barker to be a pioneer director of equal standing to d.w. griffith and maurice tourneur. how much control thomas ince exerted over the production is hard to know, but this film still has extraordinary power. the simple story of an italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in new york, is very moving. the themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today. the use of close-ups is outstanding and the powerhouse performance of george beban is electrifying. what we need now is a really good print transferred to dvd so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema.
