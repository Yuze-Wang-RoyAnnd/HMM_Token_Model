myself and my groovadelic 20-something pals just can't get enough of this awesome parker posey classic! i tried renting this on dvd, but can't seem to find it - too bad, as i'm sure the features would be "extra special" !! :) we all highly recommend this uber-cool comedy flickerino for a date, or even just a cozy night home alone! this would also be the purr-fect type of movie to watch with your cat, or even throw a party based on, like a "party girl" party, just like the one in the movie that the lovable, huggable, squeezable parker posey goes to at the end. oh, and be on the lookout for a gripping and hilarious surprise ending... move aside, the sixth sense, you've just been outdone by a way radder movie! sorry, no offense, just calling it like it is! take it from an old flick lover, comedy just doesn't get better than "party girl" with parker p! feel it! yours, ronald marie macdougall (aka dj cyber-rap)
