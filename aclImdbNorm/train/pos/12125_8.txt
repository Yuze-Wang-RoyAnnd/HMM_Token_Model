i saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about cary's [leslie howard] childhood. considering that<br /><br />at the time not much can be shown on the screen, [not that there is much in the novel] the obsession of the character with mildred [bette davis] is very well conveyed to the audience. i recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her. i have read that maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale, but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was chucked. one can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good<br /><br />adaptation of a part of it at least.
