often tagged as a comedy, the man in the white suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there.<br /><br />sidney stratton is an eccentric inventor who isn't getting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody pays him notice, he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were. after bluffing his way into birnley's textile mill, he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out, but also never needs to be cleaned!. he is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him, but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary.<br /><br />yes the film is very funny, in fact some scenes are dam hilarious, but it's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me. the contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here, do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries ?, you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in britain to know what i'm on about. the decade the film was made is a crucial point to note, the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay, science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions. you watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist stanley, from hero to enemy in one foul swoop, a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind !, it's so dark the film should of been called the man in the black suit.<br /><br />i honestly can't find anything wrong in this film, the script from roger macdougall, john dighton, and director alex mackendrick could be filmed today and it wouldn't be out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has. the sound and setting is tremendous, the direction is seamless, with the tonal shift adroitly handled by mackendrick. some of the scenes are just wonderful, one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in david lynch's elephant man some 29 years later, and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is alec guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of stanley, but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world.<br /><br />a timeless masterpiece, thematically and as a piece of art, 10/10.
