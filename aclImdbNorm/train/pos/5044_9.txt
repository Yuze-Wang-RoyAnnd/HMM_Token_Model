bill paxton stars in and directs this highly original film. having watched the first time i was by how good it was. the reviews i had heard were ok . as a result i was expecting an average thriller at most .however because of paxtons excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching , especially if you are a horror film fanatic.the film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits . the films strongest point is the storyline which i have to say is highly original and is like i have ever seen before. well done also to the 2 young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys. i give this film 9/10 and i highly recommend that everyone catches it.
