i was able to watch this movie in its entirety and was deeply moved by it. i wasn't sure if it was really a comedy or a drama - it had elements of both. mary tyler moore and valerie harper both looked wonderful - our image of 60-year-old women has certainly changed since aunt bee! they are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! the only drawback in this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in either the "mtm" or "rhoda" shows from the 1970's. i'd have thought that since it was set in new york city (where "rhoda" had been set) that at least some mention would have been made of her sister brenda or that julie kavner would have appeared, assuming of course she was still in the big apple.<br /><br />it is my hope that abc will make this a series and bring back for guest appearances all the old casts of these shows. by the way, what was wrong with cbs doing this reunion, or an eventual series? wasn't that the network that carried the "mtm" and "rhoda" shows?
