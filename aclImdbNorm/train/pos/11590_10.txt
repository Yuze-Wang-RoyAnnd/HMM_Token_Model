oh, the sixties. there were some interesting films. i was more of a movie goer then. i now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater. i also saw this short film, " the legend of the boy and the eagle". i have been searching for this film for years. it was truly inspiring. surprisingly, i was finally able to gather more information from your site. thank you........ i'm surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a disney picture. i too did not remember the disney film. i did not even remember that it was an opening film for disney. i truly wish they would show this on tv sometime. i wonder if disey holds the rights to this film? is it available on dvd? this is a must see for all generations!!!
