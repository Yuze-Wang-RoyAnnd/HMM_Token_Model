let us begin by saying that this film's english title "the power of kangwon province" is an absolute misnomer.it is because in hong sang soo's film,there are no actual shots of wars,troubles and conflicts.so the idea of establishing power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film.if we were to judge this film by its korean language title,"kangwon-do ui him" is going to appear as a cryptic statement about emotional turmoils of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest.hong sang soo has also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their lives.the people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their moods,whims and fancies. if making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a film maker's meritorious virtue then hong sang soo has to be saluted as a courageous film maker whose films speak volumes about ubiquitous nothingness of human relationships,sentiments and lives.whether one likes it or not,this is the only fair conclusion that be deduced from this particular film.
