"the good earth" is a great movie that you don't hear much about anymore. there are a lot of big disasters and events, but it is also a non-passionate love story. all of this happens in a little over two hours, which is short by today's standards. the special effects and costumes are very good for the time period.<br /><br />i am surprised that luise rainer received an oscar for such a limiting role. she basically only has three emotions: submissive, hungry, and heart-broken.<br /><br />the performances by the asian and asian-american actors are terrific.<br /><br />
