after the success of die hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of 'die hard on a .....' movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. that is what they did with cliffhanger, die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly 'stop or my mom will shoot' stallone's career.<br /><br />cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. all in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! however, if you an forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.<br /><br />you've got to love john lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, rex linn as travers.<br /><br />he may of been henry in 'portrait of a serial killer' but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' and whilst he surely can't be, it really does look like ralph waite's frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.<br /><br />mention too must go to former 'london's burning' actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football, yes, you can't help enjoy that bit, hal needed a good kicking.<br /><br />so forget your better judgement, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! and if you're looking for qaulen, he's the one wearing the helicopter.
