this movie has so many wonderful elements to it! the debut performance of reese witherspoon is, of course, marvelous, but so too is her chemistry with jason london. the score is remarkable, breezy and pure. james newton howard enhances the quality of any film he composes for tenfold. he also seems to have a knack for lost-days-of-youth movies, be sure to catch his score for the recent "peter pan" and the haunting gothic music of "the village." i first saw this film at about 13 or 14 and now i don't just cry at the ending, i shed a tear or two for the nostalgia. show this movie to your daughters. it will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film.
