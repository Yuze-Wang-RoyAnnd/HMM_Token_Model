this is by far one of the better made movies and didn't leave me disappointed at all. the sound track along with finely shot hand-held camera work was exquisite . the are always chances a movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another, but i felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent. dakota fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent. as for mr. washington and of course christopher walken they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light.
