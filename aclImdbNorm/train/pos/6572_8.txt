one of my favorite films for a number of years was "last action hero"; unfortunately, arnold schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician; so now i can't bear any film he may had a hand in.<br /><br />the adventures of jake speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in last...hero; so i was pleased to find it on dvd, so i could watch these themes played out so well.<br /><br />despite the "plot-within-the-plot" involving white slavery during an african nation's civil war, this is not an action movie. the plot that the "plot-within-a-plot" is within, is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve: is jake speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white-slave trader; or is he actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels)? i suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film, and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this. the film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional "adventure-story" universe. that's actually a rich theme, the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film's amiable and campy sense of humor.<br /><br />there are weaknesses to the film - primarily it's cinematography, which makes the film look like a tv show. and the pacing does sag on occasion.<br /><br />but i really like these characters, and i enjoy the adventure they live, however silly. and i just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel.<br /><br />holds up under multiple viewings -m good show!
