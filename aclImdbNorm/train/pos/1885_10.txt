this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old, grainy vhs versions.<br /><br />i hadn't seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time. it's one of those rare, perfect storms of comedy where great writing (truly funny line after truly funny line) is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time.<br /><br />dudley moore got an oscar nomination for "arthur" but lost (although john gielgud won for best supporting actor). if moore's performance in "arthur" doesn't win a best actor oscar -it's proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title (another example is gene wilder in "young frankenstein").<br /><br />steve gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm-hearted tone of the story. quite simply, imho the movie is a rare gem. it's only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after "arthur" was released.<br /><br />regarding the dvd that is available as of 1/2007, it's so/so. although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies, there is still no widescreen version available.<br /><br />the dvd has a few extras that are nice but it's just not enough. one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit. the dvd, being the perfect format to include such material, certainly should have offered it as well.<br /><br />this, the original "arthur", is a classic comedy that is one for the books.
