i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe. this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk. instead, it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner, a little girl with a serious stammer, overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart-wrenching scene early on. then the great journey begins. paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend, marie.<br /><br />along the way, he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people. he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her. he gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him.<br /><br />he recounts his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie.<br /><br />tony shaloub shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little paulie despite the risks. jay mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across.<br /><br />there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too. it is a witty, clever, epic animal-adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl. he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who don;t know much about parrots.<br /><br />kids who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in los angeles and pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds, especially parrots are not disposable pets. all children everywhere, will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured.<br /><br />so no babe here, more of an incredible journey with a twist.<br /><br />enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts.
