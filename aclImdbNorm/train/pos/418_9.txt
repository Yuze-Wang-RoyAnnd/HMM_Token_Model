this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level.however if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcock,cody and calamity jane then look elsewhere, as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend.the story moves with a cracking pace, and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this movie.the sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout, also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior, he actually married one of demilles daughters in real life.indeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back, the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american history.so please take time out to watch this classic western.
