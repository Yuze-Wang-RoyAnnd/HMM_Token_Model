as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark. i always sat down and watched the first one. as i got older i learned to prefer this one. what i do think is that this film is too dark for infants, but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more, it doesn't seem as dark as it was back when you were a child.<br /><br />this movie, in my opinion, is better than the first one, everything is so much deeper. it may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one. the cubs are just too adorable, i rewind that 'flying my colors' scene. i tend to annoy everyone by singing it.<br /><br />the sound track is great! a big hand to carol and dean parks. i love every song in this movie, i have downloaded them all and is all i am listening to, i'm listening to 'our beginning' also known as 'recalling' at the moment. i have always preferred this sound track to the first one, although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie 'care-a-lot'.<br /><br />i think the animation is great, the animation in both movies are fantastic. i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent. it was really surprising.<br /><br />there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great, but it is. i do not think it is weird/strange. i think it is a wonderful movie.<br /><br />basically, this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon, dark heart. the end is surprising and again, beats any 'pokemon movie' with the care bears moral issues. it leaves an effect on you. again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality.
