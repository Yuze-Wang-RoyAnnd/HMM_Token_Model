this is a masterpiece footage in b/w 35mm film. the film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at 7:35 am in a bar and how much things can happen there in 8 minutes.<br /><br />the short amazingly, gets you in a complex story using very little elements, and step to step makes you realize that something isn't totally right. it expresses a lot, makes your adrenalin go high with subtle details, and is incredibly understandable by anyone, not just the cinema critics experts.<br /><br />but i know how it sounds : european short, black and white and low budgeted. don't let that scare you. is really worth to see by anyone, not just experts in the genre.<br /><br />isn't really much more to tell, since the film just lasts 8 minutes (exactly), and i don't want to spoil it. but i just watched it online and i couldn't understand why no one spent a few minutes to post a comment about it.<br /><br />really worth watching it. 10/10.
