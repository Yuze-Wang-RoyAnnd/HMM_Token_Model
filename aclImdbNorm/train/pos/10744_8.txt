the events of september 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers. in my view it would have been better to leave this out. i think the directors tried too hard, perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop. the comment of one of a policemen - "this aint f***ing disneyworld" is apt.<br /><br />nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events. the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times, no other footage from the day matches what they shot.
