one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravo.initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it.to be perfectly honest i wasn't disappointed.the main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well.you would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film!my only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnik.christ its bad!the prison guard hank is woeful too.all he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co-guard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end. the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions. this movie is well watching alone for the beautiful,talented and very sexy jennifer thomas
