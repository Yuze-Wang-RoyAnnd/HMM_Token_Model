apparently ruggero deodato figured out, early on, that his story wouldn't work if he approached it too seriously, so he decided to camp it up. the result is a film that can be viewed as either a ludicrous sword-and-sorcery epic or as a very entertaining comedy! and i think i'll go the second way. the brief gore moments are well-done, the paul brothers openly mock the material (they even bark at each other in one scene!), and there is also a charming, spirited, good-natured performance by eva la rue, as the girl who tags along with the "boys". plus, where else can you see the insides of a dragon lighted like a discotheque??
