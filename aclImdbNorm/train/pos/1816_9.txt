lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids. that depends on the kid. this isn't a movie for a 2-6 year old; it's more geared toward the 8 years and older crowd. i saw this movie when i was 10, i absolutely loved it. at the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes. this movie deals with more serious issues, and therefore has a little more emotional impact. in this movie characters can die, and be sent to hell! this gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives. the good guys aren't always perfectly sweet and nice (like other cartoons). they have "real" motivations, like revenge, and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things aren't always black and white.<br /><br />excellent movie
