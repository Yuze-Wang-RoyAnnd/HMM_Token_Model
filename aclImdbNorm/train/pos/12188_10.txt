pure orson welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies. welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment "big dummy that i am." plot is so complex that i still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. the shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed. that scene alone is worth the price of admission. this is the only time that rita hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character. no one but welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond. no one should miss this picture.
