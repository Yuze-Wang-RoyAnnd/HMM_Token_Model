not a film to be taken seriously, but a great little film nonetheless.<br /><br />it's definitely not just a piece of fluff. the acting, imo, is excellent.<br /><br />one of those films you wouldn't go out of your way to see, but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable. like an old friend.<br /><br />definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.<br /><br />- - - - - - - -
