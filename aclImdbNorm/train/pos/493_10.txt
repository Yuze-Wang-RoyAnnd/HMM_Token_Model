i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember. when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excited.<br /><br />the premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait. it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters. the nx-01, enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love.<br /><br />scott bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer. jolene blalock gave a commanding performance as subcommander t'pol. that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of starfleet.<br /><br />enterprise looks like it's going to be a good series well worth watching, and i recommend that. watch it.
