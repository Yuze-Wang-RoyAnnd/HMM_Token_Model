as a another reviewer states hanna's war is an outstanding film about an outstanding person, hanna "anniko" senesh, who would become the jewish joan of arc. unfortunately i diverge in opinion not agreeing that miss detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. in truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces. maruschka detmers performance is brave, poignant, heartfelt or understood, and totally believable. in other words for me "in the zone." from the opening credits. if you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give hanna's war with maruschka detmers a try. my hat is off also to ellen burstyn as hanna's mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film. in that it is a team effort perhaps of two actress' but not an all about eve situation.
