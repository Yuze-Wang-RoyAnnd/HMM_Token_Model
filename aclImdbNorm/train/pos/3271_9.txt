i was always a big fan of this movie, first of all have you seen the cast, the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well. cybill shepherd was given great reviews for her role, and they were well deserved. the beginning of this movie starts in the past when corinne jeffries (cybill) whose picture-perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband louie dies unexpectedly. fortunately, louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be "recycled" back to earth as the newborn alex finch (robert downey, jr). alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while corinne tries to get on with hers. but fate crosses alexs path 23 years later when he meets corinne's daughter miranda (mary stuart masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins, and embarrassing situations occur.) the music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute. you wont be disappointed if you give it a chance, chances are you'll like it. very funny and sweet!
