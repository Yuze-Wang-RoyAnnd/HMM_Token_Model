jackie chan's classic directorial feature police story (1985) is among the most influential and over-the-top modern day police actioners ever to come out from hong kong. jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other "urban" action which would later become very popular and typical among hk directors like john woo and ringo lam. police story mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds.<br /><br />jackie plays chan ka-kui, a police who gets to protect an important witness (brigitte lin) who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity. jackie's girlfriend is played by young and sweet maggie cheung, who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like heroic trio (and the sequel) by johnnie to, savior of the soul by corey yuen and david lai and many many others. the plot in police story is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place.<br /><br />jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes, some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which jackie hits his head (near the eye) through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass. also jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film. the scene in which a bus stops right before jackie, spitting the kidnappers through the windshield, went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to. they were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries. during the end credits, there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless, but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely.<br /><br />the action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by (action) director chan. the now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver. jackie always tells how important editing is (which is true) and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to hollywood efforts, for instance. there's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch.<br /><br />but there is again one negative point which i cannot stand in hk action comedies, which is this comedy itself. the comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there, without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue. i mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare, and he is there to "murder" that girl. this kind of acting is stupid and inept and i wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre. characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those "loud thoughts" are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and "light." even if the film is comic and not so serious, these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily.<br /><br />police story is a fast speed, full impact, balls to the walls action adventure miracle from hong kong and from the time when jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the us produced the protector as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director james glickenhaus had and thus the result didn't please audiences and jackie and he returned to hong kong to make more personal and inventive film. that he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80's. this is among the most insane action films ever, and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws i mentioned. 7/10
