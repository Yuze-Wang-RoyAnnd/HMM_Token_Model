the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game. so many people have seen this film and just don't get it, and i don't understand why. while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me. i will try to explain this without any spoilers, but be forewarned, i do talk about things that happen in the movie.<br /><br />**** possible spoilers **** be forewarned!****<br /><br />his is a life of "large moves" versus "small moves". he chooses natalia to be his queen, and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy. listen closely to that description.<br /><br />when someone asks him a question, he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves. (the flashbacks are beautifully lit, by the way.) the flashbacks are quite interesting as well, for they give not only his point of view as a child, but the point of view of the other character as well. it's stunning.<br /><br />various characters become either his helpers or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on. even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on. beautifully done.<br /><br />i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin, but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end.<br /><br />this film is constantly working on many levels, which is why i endorse it. it was a treat and a joy to watch.<br /><br />if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh. the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces.<br /><br />
