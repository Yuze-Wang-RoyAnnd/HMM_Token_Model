i enjoyed this movie,and after watching it,it made me wonder just how many 'caitlin rose's' exist in the world.how many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse,and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it? just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another,because as this film demonstrates,who's right is not foremost important,its who is popular,and feared which manipulates the minds of youths,and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen.tiffani amber thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim,and brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved,and his best friend.this is the kind of film that doesn't get the exposure it deserves.remarkable,and brilliant,too good to be just a film made for tv.
