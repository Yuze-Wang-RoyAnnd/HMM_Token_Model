in the year 1985 (my birth year) steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young african-american girl celie (debut role for whoopi goldberg) whose life is followed through rough times. the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old. she has given birth two children for her father. celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable. a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him. it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling. women are inferior of men and especially being an african-american woman their rights are less than a zero. celie's story is a true survival story.<br /><br />"the color purple" is a master-piece and underestimated film of spielberg. he should make more drama which "the color purple" and "schindler's list" are good notion.<br /><br />the cast is amazing. whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama. danny glover was surprisingly nasty "mister". i have never seen him in a such an evil role. the talk-show icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed sofia.<br /><br />warning! prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film. you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood. especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sister.<br /><br />big applauds to mr. spielberg!
