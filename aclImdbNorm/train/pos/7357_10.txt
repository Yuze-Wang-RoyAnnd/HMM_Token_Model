ok where do i begin?... this movie changed my life! the plot was seamless. james cahill has out done himself. initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i hadn't seen it on the silver screen. however this was before exploring the dvd's many features!!!! oh my god jakes cahill's commentary of the film was almost as flawless as his acting. he told of industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience.<br /><br />i was so impressed by the other actors. the scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway, reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. i am certainly with gangsta when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel.<br /><br />i am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved, matched only by the sign indicating the location of the library at the school... and possibly the guy playing a retard! all in all a timeless classic and the best film to come out of europe in years! where my oscars at dawn!!!!!!!!!!!
