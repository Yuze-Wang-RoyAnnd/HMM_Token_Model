i saw this film in winnipeg recently - appropriate, given the location used. i first read lawrence's book back in the 70's and for me, it's always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society. it resonated when i was young, and it resonates even more now. when the film came out, i was keen to see if the story could survive. and was thoroughly impressed, especially with ellen burstyn's performance. she manages to give us a complete human being, even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental - someone that you wouldn't want to live with. it's great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so authentically.
