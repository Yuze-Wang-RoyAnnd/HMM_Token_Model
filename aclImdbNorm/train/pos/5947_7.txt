50 years old, this musical comedy fantasy might look its age, but it wears it with dignity.<br /><br />this film is still great fun. crosby was never really romantic lead material, but he delivers the material with the lightly humorous edge it needs. bendix plays broad and is huge fun in a part which calls upon his strengths. hardwicke - how joyous for a knight of the realm - a genuine one - to throw himself into caperings like this with such abandon. and rhonda fleming enjoys herself in the least showy of the main roles. only murvyn vye disappoints as an unconvincing merlin.<br /><br />though not a musical, the songs are very good, and the "dance" routine accompanying busy doing nothing is perfect - funny, appropriate, dexterous without being challenging, and making a virtue out of crosby's musical movement which, let's be fair, was inherently amusing due ti its never being his greatest strength.<br /><br />the colour is fine, the sound is a little muddy in places.<br /><br />and the story - well, it takes some liberties with the original, but i suspect that mr clemens might well have been pleased with the result.
