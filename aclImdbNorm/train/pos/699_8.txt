i saw insomniac's nightmare not to long ago for the first time and i have to say, i really found it to be quite good. if you are a fan of dominic monaghan you will love it. the hole movie takes place inside his mind -or does it? the acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end. the extras on the dvd are just as great as the film, if not greater for those dom fans. it has tons of candid moments from the set, outtakes and a great interview with the director. anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch tess (the director), dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film. it was pretty enjoyable and i'm glad to have it in my collection.
