i have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago, and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen. considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound. i would highly recomend this film, i wish it was available on dvd.
