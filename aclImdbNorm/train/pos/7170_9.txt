holes is not your average disney stuff- it's very, very fun, even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy, focus-group designed "family entertainment" that uncle walt's studio passes off as live-action. perhaps the secret of this film's success is in its faithfulness to the original book, which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff. the action begins when stanley yelnats is sent to a boys' prison camp, where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation. but as the story progresses, stanley's tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any disney movie about an all-boy prison camp has any right to be. jon voight is especially nasty and colorful, and sigourney weaver is beautiful, as always.
