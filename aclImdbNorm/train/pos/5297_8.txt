went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. the place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines. i knew it looked like it would be good but it was much funnier than i thought it would be. i liked both edward furlong and christina ricci, they seemed really weird just like normal people, if that makes sense. i get sick of movies that show teenagers as being like cookie cutter people, like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader"...etc. both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate to. i will be recommending this movie to all my friends and waiting very eagerly for it to be out on dvd, go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! i plan to see it again in the theater and i don't go see things more than once very often.
