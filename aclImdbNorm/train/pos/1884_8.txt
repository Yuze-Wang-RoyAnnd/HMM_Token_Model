this is one of my favorite comedies ever. not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero, but taken for what it's worth and not as trivializing alcoholism, the movie is simply a lot of fun. it tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk, irresponsible 40 something bachelor named arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune, but only if he marries susan, chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him. arthur proposes, but then unwisely falls for linda, a waitress and petty thief.<br /><br />dudley moore is perfect as arthur, the world's most endearing drunk, whose antics are a laugh a minute. admittedly, moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role. the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed. liza minnelli sparkles as linda, and her on screen chemistry with moore is great. jill clayburgh plays susan, the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur. <br /><br />however, this film is literally made by sir john gielgud, who portrays arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, hobson. it's obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during hobson's longtime employment. hobson is arthur's best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice. the most interesting relationship in this film is not arthur's romance at all, but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant. it's the butler you'll remember best long after the closing credits roll.
