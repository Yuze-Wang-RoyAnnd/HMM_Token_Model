this is an excellent film, and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/dvd. the way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of closure, and a feeling that all is right with the world. if you get a chance to see this film, then do. i can't wait to see it again, and wish that it could be put on general release.
