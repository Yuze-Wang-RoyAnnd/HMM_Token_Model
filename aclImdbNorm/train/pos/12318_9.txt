though i'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films, when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting i get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans. ching siu tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty. the great, tragic leslie cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky taoist. cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and wu ma is pleasingly off the wall as the taoist monk, who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number. perhaps best off all is joey wang as the fox spirit, truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive. the film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package. ching siu tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills, and fills the film with mists, shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours, giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere. also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters, with, if i'm not mistaken, joey wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times, a marvellous touch. though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times, this is a beautiful piece of entertainment, with swell characters and plotting, even the odd neat character arc, a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere. an ethereal treasure, highly recommended.
