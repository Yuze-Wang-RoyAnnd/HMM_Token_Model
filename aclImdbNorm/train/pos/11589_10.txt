man, i loved this movie! this really takes me back to when i was a kid. these were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reel-to-real and if you were good, they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward. i still remember one of the opening lines...."tutazema was his name, and he was an orphan. he lived with his sister so and so in the village." this is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon. at the end the other indian boys in the village attach the feathers to tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself. he gets to live the way he always wanted to. he gets to soar the heavens.
