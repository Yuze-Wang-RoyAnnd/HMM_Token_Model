several years ago when i first watched "grey gardens" i remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp. years later i still laugh out loud when i watch it, but after many viewings i've come to see the beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between the inseparable "big" edith bouvier beale and her daughter "little" edith bouvier beale.<br /><br />mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term "shabby chic". with innumerable cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece of jackie o. allowed filmmakers albert and david maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day. the result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule.<br /><br />the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love. and their lives an example of drive, determination and free-will. this movie has more to recommend it than i can put down into words. it is a rare experience that you must see for yourself.<br /><br />
