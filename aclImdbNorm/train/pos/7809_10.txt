this film moved me beyond comprehension, it is and will remain my favourite film of all time, mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its 157 minutes. what is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film, i have to put it into my dvd player, so i was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found, as i have looked everywhere i can think sporadically over the past 5 years. my favourite quote from the film is when in court the advocate says "but your own words ask for direct confrontation, isn't that a direct call for violence?" biko replies "well you and i are in confrontation now, but i see no violence!!"<br /><br />craig robertson fife, scotland
