the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain (or at least is an alan quartermain type of character), that the '85 director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply. what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain, in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga (with a touch of austin powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /><br />it was labeled by many critics to have been a "great parody," or "unintentional comedy." unintentional is the word. this movie was never intended to be humorous; witty, yes, but not humorous. unfortunately, it's witless rather than witty.<br /><br />with this new m4tv mini-series, you get much more story, character development of your lead, solid portrayals, and a fine, even, entertaining blend. this story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy. while it features both action and eye candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq, making for a fine, well - thought - out plot, and some nice complementing sub-plots. <br /><br />now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is indiana jones. nor is it a poor attempt to be so. this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aq/ksm saga. filmed on location in south africa, the audience is granted beautiful (if desolate) vistas, sa aboriginal cultures, and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here.<br /><br />steve boyum totally surprised me with this one, as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision. in fact, i have disliked most of his work as a director, until this attempt. i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be. <br /><br />this version rates a 9.8/10 on the "tv" scale from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
