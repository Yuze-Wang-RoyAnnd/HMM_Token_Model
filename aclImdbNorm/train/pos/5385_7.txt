i never watched the 'next action hero' show, and until reading the other comments here, did not know that this movie was the 'prize' from that competition. i was just flipping channels and came across this, and found myself watching, dare eagerly, all the way to the end.<br /><br />yes, the plot's been done (the most dangerous game, etc.) but i was hoping for, and almost received, the 'gotcha' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end. i think the high-tech was overdone (gps's) and gave me cold-sweat flashbacks of night rider, but it nevertheless was not too overdone.<br /><br />the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod (suspension of disbelief) that was required of the viewer. do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate? could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up? pleeease. way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much.<br /><br />the final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the after taste of a bad star trek episode. at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for zane, who doesn't get near as much work as he deserves imho - they were winners from a reality show.<br /><br />knock me out.
