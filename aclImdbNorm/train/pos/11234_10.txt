this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans, and considering it's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it's story lines are complex and twisting, and it's characters show realistic depth and dimension. the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking. while it's first season might be a little shaky, it's final few are well thought out and well shot. some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise, but these fans don't take no for an answer. i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike, 10/10 hidden frontier crew.<br /><br />make it so...
