bottom line - best romantic comedy ever. this movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for: the creation of a world and time that we want to re-visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race. when i am blue, this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh (and that is still true after many viewings - always fresh).<br /><br />all of the actors are in top form. the characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor (usually difficult to do with matthau, robbins and ryan). the supporting cast is consistently brilliant: fry ("agae", "a total pygmy package"!), jacoby & saks & maher (the three theoretical physicists as "greek chorus" - "but time doesn't exist"), durning ("something we can launch from nj"), shalhoub & whaley (robbins' boss and co-worker at the service station), and curits (eisenhower - how many comedies have eisenhower??).<br /><br />don't miss this overlooked treasure.
