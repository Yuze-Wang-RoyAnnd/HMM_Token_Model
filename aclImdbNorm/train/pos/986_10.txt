if you like jamie foxx,(alvin sanders),"date from hell",'01, you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp, (jumbo size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and david morse,(edgar clenteen), "hack" '02 tv series, decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals. there is lots of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard. jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture.
