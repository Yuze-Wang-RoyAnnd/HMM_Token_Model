of watching this as a child. although i'll probably find it god-awful now, it was kind-of spooky stuff as i was only seven or so. i also recall working on a saturday-afternoon puzzle while watching it, so i wasn't really paying much attention. however, the scene with the rolling boulders has been burnt into my mind ever since. i've asked numerous people if they've seen this flick but to no avail. 12 years ago, one person mentioned that, possibly, he had seen it, but he thought it merely a dream; a fanciful piffle like wind. it's no dream, my friend. no dreaming now. again, i haven't seen it since then, but i can't wait to find a copy and stuff it into my vcr. anything that can stay embedded in my mind's eye for 23 years deserves a '10'.
