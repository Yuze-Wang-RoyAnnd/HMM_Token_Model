i did not have too much interest in watching the flock.andrew lau co-directed the masterpiece trilogy of infernal affairs but he had been fired from the flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called niels mueller.i had the feeling that lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study,so they fired him and hired another director.this usually does not work well (let's remember the invasion).but the flock resulted to be better than what i expected.it's not a great film but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller.the character development is very well done and i could know the characters very well.also,the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible.richard gere and claire danes bring competent performances.now,let's go to the negative points.one element which really bothered me (there was a moment in which it irritated me) was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more "attitude" and style.that tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary.plus,i think the film should have been more ambitious.in spite of that,i recommend the flock as a good thriller.it's not memorable at all,but it's entertaining.
