this game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits. when i got agent under fire, i thought that was a good game but then nightfire came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of james bond game. this time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are out of this house. it even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like pierce bronsan as once again james bond, william dafoe as the villain nikolai diavolo, and judi dench as m (forgive me all if i spell it wrong). this game would be own as the greatest james bond game around.<br /><br />i give this a 10/10
