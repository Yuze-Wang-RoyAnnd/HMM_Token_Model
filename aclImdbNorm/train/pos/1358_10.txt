season after season, the players or characters in this show appear to be people who you'd absolutely love to hate. is this show rigged to be that or were they chosen for the same? each episode vilifies one single person specifically and he ends up getting killed off. you enjoy seeing them get screwed although its totally wrong and sick. you enjoy seeing them screwing others, getting screwed themselves, playing dirty, getting it back, escaping and finally getting kicked out by trump. the amount of tears also seems to be increasing by the season.<br /><br />the rewards which attempt to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also heavily reduced. in the newer seasons, its like "you get to meet xyx who'll lecture you about uvw"..like who freaking cares? the characters are so hateable, collectively and individually, that you wonder if they're paid actors? the only sane one gets to win.<br /><br />watch with caution and maintain a conscience. those are your fellow human beings in the firing line.
