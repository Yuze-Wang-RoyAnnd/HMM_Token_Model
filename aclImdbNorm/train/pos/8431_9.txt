] haven't seen this film? haven't even heard of this film? it wouldn't surprise me. one of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution. the independent company kino films, gave boesman and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion, and the majority of major film critics didn't even bother reviewing it. i guess a movie based on a one act, one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today's market - and it's the intelligent film-lover's loss.<br /><br />for the record, both angela bassett and danny glover deserved ocsar nominations (as did the cinematographer) but the film received such little fanfare that i can't even blame the academy on that one. this is a film that is challenging, thought-provoking, and heartbreaking, and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it's own terms. taking that into consideration, it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment. director john berry wisely does not attempt to dress-up athol fugard's play. sure, we're given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots, but the film version of boesman and lena remains, on the whole, a story of two people living in inhumane conditions.<br /><br />stripped of their basic human rights, boesman (glover) and lena (bassett) have no one left to attack but each other. a third character joins them for awhile (willie jonah, amazing in a largely silent role), but the film's focus never strays from the title characters and what they've become. bassett and glover give brave performances as the broken couple, performances that simply could not be improved upon. vigorously and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally, boesman and lena deserves to be rediscovered of home video. hands down, the best film of the year 2000.
