actually i'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie. i saw it as part of a slavic film festival at a major american university. but nobody in usa has heard of it, which is a real shame! the dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad. they are stuck together on a long bus trip--someplace most of us have been!! but i never had one like this!! <br /><br />my favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral. then the man & woman sneak off for some lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing! just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the way--the consumptive starts hacking & they realize everybody is watching!! talk about surprised! but...you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny! when you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did! serb humor at it's best!
