there really isn't much to say about this movie....it's crude, but fun.<br /><br />plot outline (from imdb)<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />two losers from milwaukee, coop & remer (parker & stone), invent a new game playing basketball, using baseball rules. when the game becomes a huge success, they, along with a billionaire's help, form the professional baseketball league where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. coop & remer's team, the milwaukee beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the dallas felons (vaughn) wants to institute.<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />the acting is pretty good, since there arn't many big stars in this movie. although i am not a big fan of 'southpark', parker and stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie. <br /><br />there are so many funny moments in this movie i can't come close to naming them all. it never really lets up, and they don't try to put some cruddy drama in to make it more serious. <br /><br />and my favorite aspect of this movie: the soundtrack. it's great. i especially like "take me on" and "beer" by reel big fish. very underrated.<br /><br />overall, a crude, but extremely funny, movie. 10/10<br /><br />james "black wolf" johnston
