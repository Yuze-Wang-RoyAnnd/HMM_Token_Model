when i watch a low budget film i know what to expect. i expect the acting not to be as good (budget reasons), i expect the lighting not to be as good (budget reasons)i expect the sound not to be as good (budget again). stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget film!!! i'm a filmmaker myself so i understand the budget constraints on a low budget film. stealing locations, shots etc... the list goes on and on. i don't want to say all the acting was bad. jose rosete, chris angelo, victor zaragoza are good. raul martinez is a natural. not sold on carl washington yet. he has to understand that every line is not important, some are throw away lines. i say if a film makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good film. i liked this movie. i gave it an 8. i wanted to see what was gonna happen next. great job quiroz brothers!
