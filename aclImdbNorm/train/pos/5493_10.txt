it's really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official "truth" and caught so many "news" agencies with their pants down. this movie, in my view, deserves every price there is in journalism - it's objective (yes!), courageous and a real "scoop". it can do without comment, fake scenes or leading questions - everyone, including chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words. the filmmakers "only" had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling.<br /><br />the venezuelan elite teaches us "how to depose of a president and sell it as a victory of democracy". it's amazing that they lost in the end - so far. from what i know, the biggest tv station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked, they're still broadcasting via cable and satellite. i highly doubt whether george w. or barack obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup. but then, they don't have to worry.<br /><br />the fact that the "chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians" scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so-called "free" (established) media really has become, or has always been, only more so. an important lesson to anyone interested in what "really" goes on in the world.<br /><br />the famous "objectivity" challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view, or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse "us" - it has been true with the effects of the atomic bomb, the us secret history of spreading "democracy" around the world or the iraq war that, according to johns hopkins, has killed 1,3 million iraquis by now, not to mention the 60,000 afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. to be objective, saddam hussein was less damaging to his people than the us. and the us is ready & willing to be more damaging to the iranians that he was.<br /><br />i'm quite curious about the upcoming trial of some khmer rouge leaders before the international tribunal in the hague, whether there will be any mention of "our" involvement in supporting and training pol pot's guerrillas in the 80's, when they had been largely defeated by the vietnamese. probably not.<br /><br />all the more reason to turn to the independent media for balance, if not exposure of fraud.
