one of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's, scarface is very much a film of its time. the first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you, 'made in 1983'. the costumes, the music score and soundtrack, the hairstyles, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't. this is still a superb film. while georgio moroder's music has dated a fair bit, it still compliments the story of tony montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by oliver stone and the first class direction of brian de palma, one of two films that he has made with pacino (the other being the fantastic carlito's way). all of de palma's trademarks are here; the strong language, the graphic violence (more on that later), the stylish excesses such as grandiose set pieces and of course the stylish camera work.<br /><br />pacino dominates the film and i mean that literally. he is the dominant star of this film. his performance over the top, this is one of those films were pacino doesn't so much say his lines as he does shouts them, this time with a superb cuban accent. however, this is pacino and he does it fantastically. only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact. while some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all, this is an excessive film. take a look at the production design of tony's house, take a look at the violence in this film. the chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere. the shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to schwarzenegger and stallone in the rambo films. take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so pacino's performance i suppose is perfect for the film. he is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way. steven bauer, in particularly, as manny, tony's best friend, is the stand out of the supporting cast. his performance is so controlled and quiet in a de niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn. michelle pfeiffer, of course, adds the glamor, robert loggia adds gravitas as usual and mary elizabeth mastrantonio makes a great debut as tony's sister.<br /><br />of course this is more than just a film about excess. there is more to it than drugs, violence, chainsaw assaults and a big great shoot out. this is a film about the darker side of the american dream. in many ways it puts it on a thematic par with the godfather films. tony finds himself coming to america, getting it all, living the american dream and then losing it all in violent fashion, and by saying he loses it all, i mean he loses it all. he kills his best friend, his sister is killed, his empire crumbles, literally, around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion, bullets ripping through him. <br /><br />without doubt scarface is one of the key films of the early 80's. sure, it doesn't have the subtleties of the godfather films, but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again.
