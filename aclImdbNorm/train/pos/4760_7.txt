well i gave this movie a 7. it was better than "thirdspace" but not as good as "in the beginning" as far as the b5 movies go. i really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal. let's hope the producers and cast get the next series "crusade" up to the standards of b5.
