i have read modesty blaise for several years now, collecting numbers of the strip. after the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book "modesty blaise" i was surprised the result got this good.<br /><br />what i got was a movie not based on action or violence. the director had focused on history and psychology. how was modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non-childhood. i think this thougths will give a greater understanding to the next (i hope) film. i simply loved the movies old-fashioned style.<br /><br />however everything wasn't that good, the gambling wasn't that good. almost boring and unreal. the acting could have been improved too. i'm not thinking the bad guy in this movie felt real, the only reason he was there was so modesty could have someone to tell her story for. also they could have expanded the movie, showing more about when she builds up "the network" but i'll guess thats for the next movie.<br /><br />and please forgive me for my bad english
