an old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. he wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind? is he just getting old? the movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on. there is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. you knew what was going on and i liked it.<br /><br />the other part that i liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter. those were pretty but the only thing i didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear. he could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that, it was a pretty deep movie.
