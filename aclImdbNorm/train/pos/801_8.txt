i suppose jedi is now chronologically to be considered the very "last" entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good one, as were several of these. i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back, and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a character(and also mark hamill, as an actor). after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks, they weren't so bad. i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and i felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. the ending (with some new additions, i presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i didn't already know, i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity. oh, and, err -- carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit.
