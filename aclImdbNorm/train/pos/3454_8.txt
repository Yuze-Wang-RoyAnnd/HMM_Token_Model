first off, i'm not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact i'm not even a huge justin fan, but i did like this movie.<br /><br />i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i'd never even heard of i had to see what it was about. i didn't find justin's acting that bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. the story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but i found it well done. l l cool j's character was clearly conflicted, but i honestly didn't know what he would do in the end. morgan freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as i love kevin spacey, he was kind of just there. his character didn't have a whole lot of substance, but it's kevin spacey, he can do no wrong.<br /><br />surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. truly believable and really in character, he freaked me out a couple of times.<br /><br />i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and i didn't find any of that. every shooting had a point, it wasn't clich'ed, pretty solid really.<br /><br />overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. i don't know why it didn't appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage i've seen on the big screen. i would say it's worth seeing.
