not only do the storylines in "the sopranos" engage audiences from all over, but i think (for me at least) what brings the viewers back is the acting. (not even you, gary, can dispute that claim) james gandolfini, who plays the lead-man, tony soprano, has become (in this viewer's opinion) one of the "hollywood elites" as far as acting in a television series goes. i wouldn't go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino, or at least, not just yet. he, however, does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano. in the years since 1999, gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor (mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business. and it's not just him. "the sopranos" fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco, edie falco, michael imperioli, dominic chianese, and the late nancy marchand who played tony's dreadful mother. at this point in the show's existence, it's being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so. the first two seasons were extraordinary. violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner, but without a doubt, extraordinarily done. the third season was great, but didn't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2. season 4, which wrapped up right before new-years, was the weakest season yet (or at least, in my opinion it was). despite a dry-spell, i still found it (season 4 of "the sopranos") to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that's saying a lot because lately i've been noticing a trend in good new television shows. examples of this: six feet under, the shield, curb your enthusiasm, and oz (which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year). to get back to my point though, to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year, no less, is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers. "the sopranos" ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit. to close, i'd like to say, "the sopranos" is the real deal folks. for the average mature viewer (17 and above) who enjoys drama and doesn't mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity, you might want to check out "the sopranos" if you get the chance. trust me in that it will be well worth the time.
