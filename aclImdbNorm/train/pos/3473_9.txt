i admit i had some trepidation when i first saw the previews for this film. was vh-1 treading on hollow ground here? i mean, harris and quinn don't really look or even sound like john or paul. but i have to admit, this film really surprised me. it's far from the exploitation film i expected. instead, it's a character study, a low-key, whimsical, and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship, and the ultimate lesson we all learn: it's hard, if not impossible, to capture what we once had, and what has passed us by.
