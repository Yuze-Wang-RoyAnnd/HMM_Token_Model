although kurt russell was and is probably the closest person to look like elvis in show-business, so many things were false in this film. first of all, the makers claimed elvis opened his famous live shows in '69 after a 9 year hault for films by wearing a white jump-suit made in 1972. also they claimed he sang 'burning love' which he first sung in 1972 and 'the wonder of you' which he first recorded in 1970. they also claim that he got his first guitar for christmas when all elvis fans know he got it for his birthday. i know all movies based on past have something false but these things are so obvious to people who like elvis.
