as a kid i remember being nine or ten and loving this movie. it was the all round bollywood action/comedy movie. it is a imitation of bad boys obviously! the whole swapping identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colourful villains who dance and sing! the action scenes in the film aren't revolutionary but still amazing scenes. the film is genuinely very funny and was the great comeback amitabh bachan needed. govinda is a gem like always and this is probably his best work to date, he shines as the side kick nd delivers the best comedy scenes available in indian cinema.<br /><br />the songs....the songs are both funny and catchy..............proving laughs when you least expect it...amitabh bachan surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh as 'bade miah'....his accent...body language..... brilliant...<br /><br />'assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song..............hilarious.
