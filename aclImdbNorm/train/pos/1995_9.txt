i just saw this recently, after an interval of nearly forty years. it holds up well, especially lionel bart's outstanding songs. ("who will buy" with it's magical counterpoint, just one of many standouts.)<br /><br />i disagree with the other post that decried its g rating. the ratings system, brand new at the time, never intended the g (general) rating to mean "completely devoid of conflict".<br /><br />characterizing it as unsuitable for kids reminds me of the description i once saw of the wizard of oz: a girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she encounters. she then goes on a road trip with three male companions and kills again.
