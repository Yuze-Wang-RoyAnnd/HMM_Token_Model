this was a great romantic comedy! historically inaccurate (einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in imdb) but he made a great matchmaker. he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working. the supporting cast (lou jacobi, joseph maher, gene saks, stephen fry, etc.) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience. the fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around. and did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks! (two new entries for the imdb goofs section.) historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. i give it an 8!
