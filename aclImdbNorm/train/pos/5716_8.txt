haven't seen any of the japanese grudge-films, but i really enjoy this one. i rarely get scared when watching films. i can jump, if the effect and sound is startling enough, but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me. but i did get scared from grudge. maybe because i didn't expect anything at all when i watched it. i didn't expect getting scared. i didn't know anything about it either. that was probably a good thing.<br /><br />this is a film that you, apparently, either love or hate. most people seem to compare it to the japanese grudge-films, but even though i haven't seen them, i believe it isn't right to compare any film, actually. this film stands on it its own.<br /><br />the story is weak, most people say. i don't agree. the story is minimalistic, and done so on purpose. the story-telling techniques used - the broken time frame for instance - is perfectly done. the director knows exactly what he's doing, and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted it.<br /><br />i gave this film 8 of 10. it is a film you will enjoy watching, or hate. it's as simple as that.
