i just can't believe some of the comments on this show! the show is just genius! sure it doesn't follow the tried and true, but do we as consumers always want the same things thrust at us over and over again. shouldn't we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while. the style is not as realistic as previous "scooby doo" shows, but it's not supposed to be. the show it titled "shaggy and scooby doo get a clue" what part of that title states that the entire beloved cast of other renditions would constantly join in the action. and nowhere does it say that they'd be solving mysteries, and they can't even stand monsters, so why would they? i'm actually glad that they put some long standing plot points that work into a scooby-doo show. they still have running jokes, clumsy hi-jinks, quick-change outfits in chase scenes, the standard hallway gag and even scooby snacks. in fact i'm glad that this show is out there, because i just love it. i'm even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on just two main characters and a villain.<br /><br />sure it's ridiculous, it's supposed to be! sure it's different, it's supposed to be. it's supposed to make you laugh at the villain, and cheer for the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all intruding vermin, no matter what the size. you're supposed to get the running "roobi-roo" joke. the whole thing is just put together so well, there isn't a single thing i can think that is wrong with it. the writing, the acting, the animation, all top notch. the title music is awesome (my computer plays "get a clue!" when it boots up), and the background music is just gripping.
