it's not too bad a b movie, with sanders, barrie, hale, cowen, hamilton, gargan, fitzgerald and even willie best we could be either with charlie chan, moto, the falcon, blackie, holmes or the saint etc. in other words you get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends, from plain to urbane, murdering and being murdered - always a pleasure in my book.<br /><br />barrie's a hard-boiled dame out to avenge and clear her framed and dead father, a police detective by planning and carrying out with her coterie a string of underworld assassinations. which would surely have had the opposite effect! sanders joins in the fun simply by dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting falling on both him and the first killer (at the right time!) and killing him.<br /><br />the story and acting's ok, the only gripe i've got is near the end with the hurried and almost laughable discovery of who the evil genius (waldeman) was - did they almost forget about his relevance in the plot? that said, a solid entry in the series.
