i admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it (and they are not pervs!) as a must see. and it is a must see! just don't expect to see something outbreaking.<br /><br />the freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film, but there's just too much perversion and it doesn't stick in the end.<br /><br />some of the good things are the analyzes of kieslowski's blue, most of david lynch's, some of hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more i missed (i just remembered...dogville), and i usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air.<br /><br />other than being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory.<br /><br />i really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of mr. zizek to revive freud's theory, which has been numb for too long, specially in north america. again, it's way over the top and i believe not to be a completely waste of time for i do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood.
