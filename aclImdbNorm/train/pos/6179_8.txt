it's good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a "musical", for that's what this film is, pure and simple. like its unofficial remake, murder at the windmill (1949), the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of super-decorative girls including ann sheridan, lucy ball, beryl wallace, gwenllian gill, gladys young, barbara fritchie, wanda perry and dorothy white. carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to "cocktails for two". undoubtedly the movie's most popular song, it is heard no less than four times. however, it's gertrude michael who steals the show, not only with her rendition of "sweet marijauna" but her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend. as for the rest of the cast, we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether. the only good thing about oakie's role is his weak running gag with cult icon, toby wing. in fact, to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is over-indulged and over-strained, super-dumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though, would you believe, in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect. director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close-up after close-up.
