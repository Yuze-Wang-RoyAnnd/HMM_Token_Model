the wonderfully urbane ronald coleman is show-cased here as in few other of his films. he is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him, not in spite of him. he is handsome, witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering, lovely wife--played perfectly by anna lee. the movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce. most of the supporting cast is well known, at least by face if not name...and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film. the fantastic mr. coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters. his multi-talents can be further appreciated in the classic "lost horizon" which every film buff must see.
