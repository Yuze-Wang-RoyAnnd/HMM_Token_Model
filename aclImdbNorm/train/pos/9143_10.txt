it seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with george orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in american history!! the upsurge in the economy, and a reemergence in basic american values, cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the american people with a very auspicious disposition!! there have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered superior!! "purple rain" is such a movie in this category!! made in 1984, "purple rain" provided a doggerel of eighties, happy-go-lucky quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film!! certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics!! screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in american history!! set in minneapolis, "purple rain" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. when i was a little kid, i lived in minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! by 1984, african americans had made some in roads into minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well!! the movie "purple rain" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which effortlessly captivated the movie audience!! i loved the music to "purple rain", and, the innovative approach this film takes to confrontational success, is indeed, brilliant!! see this movie if you have not seen it already!! prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece!! for a short time, he dated kim bassinger, he must be doing something right!! "purple rain" put prince on the map!! this film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of thumbs up!!!!
