this film was released the year i was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. i watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. while it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped, nevertheless, it was superb. pearl s. buck's story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of luise rainer and paul muni. the novel which earned ms. buck the nobel prize for literature comes alive under the baton of sydney franklin which along with an excellent script recounts the story of peasant farmer, wang lung, whose father obtains a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord. in buck's story, wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the land. in the end he comes to realize that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. buck's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. the german-born luise rainer brings a tentative but determined peasant chinese woman to life in her portrayal of olan. muni likewise captures the naive but honorable wang, eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant. other classic characters include charlie grapewin, dorothy gale's kansan uncle henry from the wizard of oz, walter connelly as the mewing, conniving uncle and keye luke as number one son-- but this time, not charlie chan's.<br /><br />a classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of. if that's indeed the case, this film is a classic, no doubt whatsoever.
