watching this again after a gap of many years and remembering the flop it was upon its original release, i am surprised at how well it has held up. one of the reasons for its failure was that one generation just thought it was over indulgent crap and a younger one was disappointed that it did not show the full hippy glory. seen now it is clear that antonioni was already aware of and fascinated by the heady mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of any clear vision for the future. the lead pair are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much flak for the film's perceived failure. they are ideal and convey perfectly the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure delight in lovemaking. i blame others for the over emphasis on the student revolt sequences at the start but have to say that from there on in this is one of the directors most beautiful looking pictures and he certainly got the very best out of the man made and natural landscapes. oh, and i haven't even mentioned the highly explosive ending.
