i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in care-a-lot. now, after so many years have passed, i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it. if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children, then you should, just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get thrilled over the care bears and care-a-lot! the songs, especially "forever young" are very sweet and memorable. parents, i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be! when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv, you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these.
