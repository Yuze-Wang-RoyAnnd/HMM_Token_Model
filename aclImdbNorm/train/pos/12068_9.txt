if you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue, and any sense of american cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film. it probably was originally a play, and that's why it's dialogue heavy, but i can't stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters.<br /><br />this film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character-driven story.<br /><br />
