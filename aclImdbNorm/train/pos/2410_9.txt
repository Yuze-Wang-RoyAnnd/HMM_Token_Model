this movie is one of the most provocative jesus movies i have ever seen. it does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of jesus christ. it is darkly witty, playful and seriously faithful to elements of the jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation. judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals, not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine, but a grossly mistaken man, horribly misguided in his zeal. chris saranden's jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed--very human while also divine. the final dialog is thoughtfully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity. i would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
