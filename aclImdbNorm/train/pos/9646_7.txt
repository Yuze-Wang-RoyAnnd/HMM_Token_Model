there is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship--one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. and there is also emotion in the inner-workings of mathieu's family dealing w/ his mother's problems--and how that comes to bear on their relationship. but the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unless i'm just too dumb to pick up on them). why is mathieu in a mental hospital? what led to the boys' break-up? and the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first. it seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills, or some male nudity. but as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying.
