"against all flags" is every bit the classic swashbuckler. it has all the elements the adventure fan could hope for and more for in this one, the damsel in distress is, well, not really in distress. as spitfire stevens, maureen o'hara is at her athletic best, running her foes through in defiance of the social norms of the period. anthony quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless captain roc brasiliano and proves to be a wily and capable nemesis for brian hawke (flynn). for the classic adventure fan, "against all flags" is a must-see. while it may not be in quite the same league as some of errol flynn's earlier work (captain blood and the sea hawk, for instance), it is still a greatly entertaining romp.
