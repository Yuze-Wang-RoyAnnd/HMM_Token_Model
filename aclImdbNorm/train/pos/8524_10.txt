the kids, aged 7 to 14, got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year. they all loved it! kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently, and we get a kick out of watching it with them.<br /><br />it's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long, and offers laughs for the adults, too. most enjoy it more than the first.<br /><br />top-quality production and an excellent cast, led by christopher showerman as a superior george--athletic, energetic, and wholly credible, with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face--well supported by the inimitable christina pickles as the evil mother-in-law, thomas haden church as the evil jerk rival, and everybody else. this is fun.
