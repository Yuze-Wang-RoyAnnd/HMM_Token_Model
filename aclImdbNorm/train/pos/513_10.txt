<br /><br />filmed just after the war, this story was made in order to highlight anglo-american relations after the war. it ended up receiving the honour of being the first royal premiere after wwii.<br /><br />remarkably the film tangles together the royal air force, sigmund freud psychology, the founding fathers of america and various others up the long stairs (special effects in its infancy) and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity. <br /><br />although sounding absurd, this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since. <br /><br />be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet, innocent and charming love story. roger livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show!!!! <br /><br />british cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years.<br /><br />
