this film is being described as a comedy, but it wasn't a comedy at all. like any panahi film, it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy. but it was very funny; much lighter than the director's dark and serious the circle (my favourite iranian film). the resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable (as if it were a documentary) and completely hilarious.<br /><br />the filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing. it added a realism much like australia's kenny, of course a very different film.<br /><br />the performances from all the non-professional actors
