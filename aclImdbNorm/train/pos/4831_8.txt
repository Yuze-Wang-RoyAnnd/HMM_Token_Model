i went into this expecting not to like it; i figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest, and rather plodding and dull.<br /><br />it's actually far better than that, and i found myself really enjoying it. i don't know too much about queen victoria beyond what most know - married to albert, who died young, and she mourned him ever after. seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating; in fact i found myself wishing i'd seen more of the story, and i imagine we may see a sequel at some point.<br /><br />visually the film is stunning. the sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top. the acting is top notch from everybody involved.<br /><br />in a word, it was great!
