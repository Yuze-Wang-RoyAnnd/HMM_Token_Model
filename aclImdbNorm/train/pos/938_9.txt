although george c. scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent, he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of ebenezer scrooge.<br /><br />particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie's end. as scott stands before a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is his silhouette. augmented by scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing...much like marlon brando's first scene in apocalypse now. "the horror," indeed! <br /><br />however, as they say, the very thing that works for you can also work against you. because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious. to put it another way, the "before" scrooge is almost as charismatic as the "after," even though he really shouldn't be. it's what you might call the "doctor smith" effect, since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike).<br /><br />actually, i myself don't consider scott's glib rage a liability. but other "christmas carol" purists might. see the film and judge for yourselves.
