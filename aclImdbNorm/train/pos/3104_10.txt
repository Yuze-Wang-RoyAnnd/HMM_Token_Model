this movie was excellent. i was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did. like all the bourne movies the action is fast paced, realistic and intense. if you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also. the movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic. ok, julia stiles character showing up in the italian safe house was kind of far-fetched especially after what happened in supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in "treadstone" that bourne knows, that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction. the action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them. the thing that i always loved about the bourne movies is that bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them. they never treat the audience like idiots.<br /><br />all the actors were solid in their performances. i believe that damon could play bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from joan allen reprising her role from supremacy, david strathairn and scott glenn. i recommend this film and the trilogy. i do miss franka potente though.
