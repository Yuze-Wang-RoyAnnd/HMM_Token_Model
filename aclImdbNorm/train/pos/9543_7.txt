the japanese cyber-punk films have never really done a whole lot for me, but of the handful that i've seen, most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. meatball machine is no exception.<br /><br />the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts, takes control of their bodies, turns them into "necroborgs", and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game" for the enjoyment of said parasites. the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other, but whose love-affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites, and are forced to fight each other. it becomes a test of human-will vs. the parasite's control over their physical bodies...<br /><br />meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo (as most cyber-punk films are), and for good reason. there are definitely some thematic parallels, though the films are definitely different. there's plenty of fun, splattery moments in meatball machine, and the creature/borg fx are definitely the high-point - a mixture of tetsuo-meets-gwar that are both elaborate and inventive. depending on your taste for these types of films, meatball machine may or may not be your thing. if you enjoy hyper-kinetic cyber-punk films with a healthy dose of splatter - this one's for you...7/10
