this fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre. i was happy to see william powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitude of his nick charles character (from the "thin man" series). while the story is good on its own, i think what really makes this movie fun to watch is michael curtiz' fantastically imaginative direction. from a visual point of view, this is a richly textured movie, with curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium; from split screen images, to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best hollywood directors. highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie.
