i saw this movie on the bifff festival in brussel, spring 2004. what a surprise! this german production, a stylish and imaginative shocker, is one of the scariest flic i have seen. be warned: this is not a joke! this terrorizer has a big cast of good actors (as an example:peter martell as a european guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, nice production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like italian horror movies in the eighties. flesh ripped clean to the bone...and the blood runs red ...this savage heart stopper will grip you...and give you some dark dreams ... a must-see!!
