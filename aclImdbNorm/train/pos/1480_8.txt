i am right now in front of the tv, watching casomai. it is changing, it id evolving or better...devolving. it begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love-story is reported. after that everything change, a child was born, and all the rest usually happen in a couple. it is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. it doesn't want to show us something particular, there is nothing new, it is just a normal love-story, the story of a couple, and being normal it become different from the rest. it is also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is long just some seconds. it is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about that, and their opinion is central, the opinions create the story and destroy it. it is a simple story of a couple as i said, but it is not boring, it just show a couple, should be everything known, it is, but i am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen, so don't forget to watch the end!
