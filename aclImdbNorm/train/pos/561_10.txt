anthony mann's westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard hawks as the best film director in that genre. he certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy stewart - in mann's films there is an edge to jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. in winchester '73 it was the relationship of stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. here it is a "i trust only myself" attitude, which leads to one complication after another. even before the film properly begins he (as jeff webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle). <br /><br />he meets his match in skagway, the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to dawson. skagway's boss is a so-called law man named gannon (john mcintyre) who reminds one of the real boss of skagway in the "gold rush" jefferson "soapy" smith and judge roy bean. the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine) the herd is confiscated (to be sold later for gannon's profit). <br /><br />stewart is partner with ben (walter brennan - who oddly enough won his last oscar playing judge roy bean). they are also joined by rube morris (jay c. flippen) and also meet two women, the sophisticated rhonda castle (ruth roman) and the friendly and helpful renee vallon (corinne calvert). rhonda works closely with gannon, but had helped jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in seattle. however, she has a similar "i only trust myself" attitude to jeff. she does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to dawson. he, ben, and rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle. renee follows and warns them that gannon and his associates are following. jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border, although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of skagway gannon can wait until he does to hang him.<br /><br />the reunited party of rhonda and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson, jeff opting for a longer and safer route. after he is proved right, they go by his route and reach dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields. the herd is sold to rhonda, and jeff, ben, rube, and renee start prospecting. there is soon two groups in the town of dawson. one led by connie gilchrist and chubby johnson want to build a decent town. but the mounties won't be setting up a station in dawson for months. the other, centering around the "dancehall" run by rhonda, are in cahoots with gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers (robert j. wilke - really scary in one sequence with chubby johnson and jay c. flippen, jack elam, and harry morgan). jeff wishes to steer clear of both, and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in utah. but will they get there? and will jeff remain neutral?<br /><br />the performances are dandy here, including stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough. brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results. flippen is a drunk at first, but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab stewart in the heart using stewart's own words against him. mcintyre would achieve stardom on television in wagon train replacing ward bond, but his work in mann's films show his abilities as a villain (such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in winchester '73). he is, as is said elsewhere on this thread, really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor. roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being, whose fate is determined by her better feelings. and calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier "gigi" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman.<br /><br />best of all is the canadian rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of monument valley by john ford. mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.
