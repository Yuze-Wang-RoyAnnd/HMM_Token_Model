guys and dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever. it is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more. it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals-musicals were made to entertain, not to to preach. nowadays we have rent and chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached. the only thing that bothered me in the movie was marlon brando, the guy can't sing! it was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when i couldn't understand him. if it weren't for marlon i would have given this 10 stars. guys and dolls provides old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days. watch it to have a good time!!
