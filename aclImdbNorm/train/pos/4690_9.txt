twenty five years ago, i showed this film in some children's classes in entomology and can still remember the excitement of the kids; they were spellbound! it is not just about the termites who have built and live in the "castles of clay," but also about the other animals who use the mounds. there is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch. it is a not only good for entomology classes, but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds. <br /><br />i wish it was available on dvd, so that i could watch it again and show others.
