wow baby, this is indeed some fine asian horror/gore, and a crazy outlandish movie. this is a japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of tetsuo, except in this case with all the blood and guts, there is a bizarre love story. it's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie, with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into part machine or i guess cyborgs. the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human, is they need to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. this would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that, with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun. the movie also borrows a little from carpenter's "the thing" in creature design and effects. i would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds, as there is non-stop carnage and some very fine gore. and a must-have for stoners, because you don't even need to read the sub-titles, the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip. the design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of frank henenlotter's movies, which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour. "meatball machine" is great fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it, and i simply loved it.
