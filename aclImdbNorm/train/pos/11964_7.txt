i went to the movie theater this afternoon expecting to be underwhelmed by scoop. happily, the film exceeded expectations, at least a little bit. it's nothing heavy, nothing deep -- and not anywhere as good as any number of real allen masterpieces -- but it's also completely enjoyable as a light, bantering comedy. there's something kind of simple and sweet about it. "cute" was the word i heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show. it doesn't feel like allen set out to create a masterpiece here, it feels like he wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it. compared to just about everything hollywood is producing, allen's stuff has a tendency to charm. even the fluffy stuff. these days it's just refreshing to go to a movie made by an actual human being.
