originally conceived as a solo vehicle for dudley moore, 'not only...but also' saw his ex-'beyond the fringe' collaborator peter cook guest on the first show, and so well received was it the controller of b.b.c.-2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on. they were a classic comedy team - cook was tall, handsome and witty, while dudley was short, charismatic, and musically gifted. the sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub, wearing flat caps and mufflers, fantasising about movie stars such as jane russell and greta garbo. it remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time, and even when cook corpses it still holds together well.<br /><br />those characters - idiot pete and even-bigger idiot dud - found their way into every episode of the show proper, seen in a different setting, such as a zoo or an art gallery. in the latter, they munched sandwiches while discussing works of art. "that leonardo davinci cartoon...i don't see the joke!", says dud. pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits. dud nearly chokes on his repast. "you really are enjoying those sandwiches!", ad libs cook. the pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold. the sketches themselves set new standards for comedy, standards that would not be matched until the arrival of 'monty python'.<br /><br />as the show's popularity increased, so did the quality of the guest stars. peter sellers for instance, and john lennon, the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem 'deaf ted, danoota, & me'. 'one leg too few' - had dud as 'george spigott' ( a name later re-used in the film 'bedazzled' ), a one-legged man, who hops into the office of film producer cook to audition for the role of 'tarzan'. cook tries to let him down as best as he can. "i've nothing against your right leg!", he says. "the trouble is - neither have you!".<br /><br />dud would on occasion interview the eccentric sir arthur streeb-greebling ( cook ), who when he was not teaching ravens to fly underwater, was planning on opening a restaurant called 'the frog & the peach'. another classic was 'the leaping nuns' ( also reused in 'bedazzled' ). but my all-time favourite has to be 'superthunderstingcar', a wickedly funny ( and accurate ) parody of gerry and sylvia anderson's 'thunderbirds'. pete and dud played all the roles, with the latter making a fetching 'lady penelope'. 'ludwig' had ludwig van beethoven as the star of a 'this is tom jones' style variety show. 'the immortal bargo' was a spoof documentary on the life of reclusive movie star 'emma bargo'. in an unforgettable moment, she drove through london, bellowing through a loudhailer: "i want to be alone!".<br /><br />a season 3 feature was 'poets cornered' with the likes of ronnie barker, spike milligan, barry humphries, willie rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank. they each had to improvise the line of a poem, and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff.<br /><br />three seasons were made in all, produced ( at different times ) by joe mcgrath, dick clement and jimmy gilbert. sadly very few editions survive. to make matters worse, the scripts were destroyed as well. it beggars belief that this situation was allowed to happen.<br /><br />the show ended in 1970. the comics then hit broadway, made the infamous 'derek & clive' tapes, but cook's ever-increasing alcoholism broke them apart. eight years later, cook announced that a new series was in the offing, but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part. his ex-partner was making films in america, and had no intention of working with cook again ( not at that time anyway ).<br /><br />enough footage was scraped together for a season of b.b.c.-2 repeats in the early '90's. as expected, some items had not held up as well as others. cook died in 1995, and by way of a tribute the b.b.c put together a programme compiled from various 'parkinson' interviews and 'not only...but also' shows. it ended rather appropriately with pete and dud finding themselves in heaven. "bloody hell!", exclaimed the latter. moore passed on in 2002.
