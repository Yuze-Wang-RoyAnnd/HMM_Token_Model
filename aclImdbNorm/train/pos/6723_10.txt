riding giants is an amazing movie. it really shows how these people lived back then just to surf. their lives were basically surfing, living, breathing, and having fun. they didn't care about money, jobs, girls or any thing. to them the waves were their girls. i have never been on a surf board, and it looks so hard, i don't understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense at all. this is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie. if you're a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing, how it came into life, who is really famous at it or what ever, then you should really see it. it might be a documentary, but it is really good. -tara f.-
