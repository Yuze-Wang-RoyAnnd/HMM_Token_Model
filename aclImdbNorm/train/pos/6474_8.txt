i totally got drawn into this and couldn't wait for each episode. the acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be , together with the effects it would have on those closest. the only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all 'explained' at the end. we couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what gary's part in the whole thing was? why did kyle phone him and why did he go along with it? having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion. i have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either. very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????
