beautifully filmed, well acted, tightly scripted suspense movie. had me on the edge of my seat. i liked the lead actress very much, and thought the villain was very well done. not much to chew on here in the way of a theme, but if you just get in your seat, turn your brain off, watch the fancy camera work, and enjoy the plot, you will have a great time. the plot is well worn, and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in. but that didn't bother me, as i enjoyed watching it unfold. in the old days, they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters, and there were some enticing moments when i hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines. but these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused. the plot got me by the throat fairly early on, and never let go. it's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie. as i'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense. just sit back and enjoy.
