i stumbled on this late last night n tcm.<br /><br />hadn't seen it since it came out originally, but had never forgotten it.<br /><br />i had completely forgotten how gorgeous and talented signe hasso was when she was still young, ditto for shelly winters before she balooned out.<br /><br />ronald coleman, though, was the quintessential state actor of his time - i had read othello in high school english - and hated it. after seeing "a double life" i read it again and finally understood what the play was about.<br /><br />the gordon/kanin writing team was at its peak when this script was done -<br /><br />a movie well worth remembering and rewatching,
