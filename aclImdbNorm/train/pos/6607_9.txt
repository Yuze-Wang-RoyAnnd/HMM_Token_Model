i would almost give it 10 out of 10. however, there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss-leading which hurt the flow/continuity of the film. the story line is great and well composed; you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it. the characters are complicated and so is the story line, expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head, it's a film where all is explained in the end. the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else i've seen in animation. it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so it's worth watching it on a good t.v, or plasma. the character voices do save this film in its english version, but it would have been more convincing if there were some french accents to emphasize that its happening paris, i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitles. one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or blueray if they have it! and personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like; waking life & ghost in a shell 2 innocence, this is just a personal suggestion.
