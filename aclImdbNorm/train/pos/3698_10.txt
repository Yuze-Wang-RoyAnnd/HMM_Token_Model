i had no idea what this movie was until i read about it in the l.a. weekly. i generally agree with the reviews in the la weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. the film stars molly parker (from my favorite television show deadwood) and lukas haas -- who i suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future. the film is funny, heartwarming, features great acting, and beautiful photography. i don't know if the film has distribution, but i hope it does - or will - soon. this is destined to be a real indie gem. it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews! the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening. even without her there... this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival.
