the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10. that could have been so much better, this movie deserves it.<br /><br />this is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously. if you do not like movies about serial killers, but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former sovjet union, this movie is a must-see anyway.<br /><br />i can't compare it to "silence of the lambs" for several reasons. the way the serial killer is portrayed, has been done far much better in citizen x. you see several details of his private life, because you "travel" along with the killer, which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration.<br /><br />the only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was "henry - portrait of a serial killer". if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x.
