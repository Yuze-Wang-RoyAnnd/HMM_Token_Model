this was one of the best movies i have seen. the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part. although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget, i found it to be exhilarating to watch.<br /><br />some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction. however, when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters, there is no direction is life. i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations.<br /><br />most of the cast are newcomers to the industry. however, they all pulled it off very well. everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately.<br /><br />i think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control. this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways.
