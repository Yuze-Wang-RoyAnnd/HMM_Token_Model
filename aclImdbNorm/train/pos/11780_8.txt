this is a documentary i came across by chance on the uk tv channel more4 and i have to say i found it extremely interesting and thought provoking. i will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary. basically this is professor jared diamond theory on why certain parts of the earth's societies prospered and others did not. the argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one. as for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re-created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary. diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses. people have claimed his theory is marxist but i do not buy this and see it more socio geologist. it was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion. highly recommended viewing.
