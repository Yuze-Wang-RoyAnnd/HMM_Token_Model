...and i love it. lots of special effects, and for a movie that's not made on mega budget, this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece. i'm one of the guys who didn't understand the story at all, but this was still a great flick to watch. it's definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings, and on par with movies like harry potter. which is saying a lot for a movie again, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits.<br /><br />one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong. the topic is exotic and original. production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie, and acting is great.<br /><br />one of the best movies to come out of hong kong, this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie, and i hope they'll continue working in this area, until they surpass hollywood adventure movies.<br /><br />just fantastic.
