tony hawk underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster, tony hawk pro skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what neversoft and activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting.<br /><br />underground introduced the storymode, which was very cool because it made a whole new world for tony hawk pro skater fans. another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard, which is nice because now you can actually climb, run, and do all sorts of new things.<br /><br />the levels are good, neversoft also improved on an issue that started with pro skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs. the first two games for the ps1, n64 and dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some. pro skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits. in this version, they shortened those features, there isn't as many people wondering the streets, in fact there are almost none in some levels, and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot.<br /><br />this game does have one con, the storymode is a little short, of course this is neversofts first time doing this with tony hawk pro skater, so that is understandable. however, with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day.<br /><br />overall, a great addition that was very refreshing.
