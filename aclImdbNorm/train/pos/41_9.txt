"who done it?" contains many surefire laughs and gags. it is not only one of the best stooges films with shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies columbia produced. director bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the stooges, but when curly howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the columbia comedy team of schilling and lane (their version was released as "pardon my terror.") it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of 1947.<br /><br />old man goodrich calls ace detectives shemp, larry, and moe out of fear that he will be murdered. when they arrive at his home, goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the stooges. will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? <br /><br />shemp is particularly funny in this film. his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! other funny scenes: the close-up of moe's mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.<br /><br />nikko the goon (played by duke york) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film. with his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a stooge, if he didn't tower over everyone else! "who done it?" is a gem among the stooges films with shemp. even die-hard curly fans will enjoy this one! a true stooge classic. 9 out of 10.
