i've seen the blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the 1950's.<br /><br />a strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this. a strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor's, where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass. the doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger. when these incidents are reported to the police, they don't believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up. they finally believe them when the mass, now huge turns up in the town's cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming. it then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside. the blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes, which is its weakness. it is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the arctic and disposed of there. but it is only frozen, not dead...<br /><br />this movie has a typical setting for its period: teenagers and a small town. the blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout.<br /><br />the sequel, beware! the blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of the blob movies.<br /><br />the cast is lead by steve mcqueen (the great escape)and is the movie that made him a star and aneta corsaut plays his girlfriend. i'm not familiar with any of the other stars.<br /><br />the blob is a must see for all sci-fi fans. fantastic.<br /><br />rating: 4 stars out of 5.
