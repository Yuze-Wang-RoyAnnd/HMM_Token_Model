the biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of daryl hannah. rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles that she usually does she plays a street-smart, intelligent, world-weary character. she doesn't have a huge role but she does a great job portraying lois harlan as a woman tired of, although used to, covering up for her boss' indiscretions.
