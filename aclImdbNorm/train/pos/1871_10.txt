i was adopted at birth and certainly did not have the problems antwone fisher had in the movie, but i still share some of the emotions and this movie really helped to bring them out and force me to deal with them. it even caused me to realize that i do have a "missing piece" and i am going to seek out my birthparents now.<br /><br />i cried for almost a day after i saw this the first time. antwone's confrontation with his birthmother juxtaposed with his father's family's reaction to his sudden appearance are powerful for those of us who don't know what will happen if we find our birth parents. and his self-confidence and self affirmations to his mother and against the abusers of his past were so powerful. i could really identify with this and my need to tell people "yeah, i was put aside by my parents when i was born. but another set of parents picked me up and loved me. and now i am a success!"<br /><br />it also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children, who did go through tragic experiences before they came to our home. and it helped me to realize just how messed up our social system is. if you remember reading the story last year about the foster kid in florida who was "lost" and then the "miranda & ashley" story in oregon city where scf ignored multiple sexual abuse complaints about the man who ultimately killed them and the week this movie was released, yet another story in new jersey of three kids who were ignored by the system. one died. the state apparently thought the home they were in was ok because the guardian was employed (as a stripper) and "only occasionally" used heroin!<br /><br />there are just so many issues that are brought out in this movie - and they are dealt with so well by the script and by the acting that antwone fisher should be a "best picture" nominee for sure. no matter if you are adopted or not, it is a heart-tugger that can't be ignored by anyone concerned about children in our society.
