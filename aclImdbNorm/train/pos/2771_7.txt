david and bathsheba is a lavish hollywood biblical picture produced out of 20th century fox by darryl f. zanuck, directed by henry king and starring gregory peck {king david}, susan hayward (bathsheba), raymond massey (nathan), kieron moore (uriah) and jayne meadows (michal).<br /><br />the film is based around the second old testament book of samuel from the holy bible. it follows king david, who as a child had slain the giant goliath, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of israel. a tough and assured king, david however has affairs of the heart causing great problems. for once he spies bathsheba taking a shower {re;bath}, it 's the start of a journey encompassing adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end in the judgement of god being called upon.<br /><br />typically for the genre, david & bathsheba is a large, grandiose production. from its excellent set designs to it's positively gorgeous technicolor photography {leon shamroy}, it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values. untypically, tho, the film is sedately paced and relies on 99% of its worth being driven purely by dialogue. this is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle. this is a very humanist picture, in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here, it's a biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart. but that is no bad thing at all, because breaking it down we find it's very well acted {peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well & hayward is pushing it to the max}, and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten henry king. and although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing, the character flow is never interrupted as phillip dunne's (the ghost and mrs. muir) oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout.<br /><br />sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical/swords & sandals genres (most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point), but really it's well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres. 7/10
