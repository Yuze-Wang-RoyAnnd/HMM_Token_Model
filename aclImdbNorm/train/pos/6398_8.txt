"inspirational" tales about "triumph of the human spirit" are usually big turn-offs for me. the most surprising thing about men of honor is how much i enjoyed it in spite of myself. the movie is as predictable and cliched as it gets, but it works. much credit goes to the exhilarating performances by both leads. it's a perfect role for cuba gooding, jr., who's wonderfully restrained here. we have come to expect a lot from de niro, and he doesn't disappoint. he creates a darkly funny portrait. director george tillman, jr. set out to make an old-style flick and comes up with a winner.
