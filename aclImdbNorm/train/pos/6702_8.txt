even though there are no new episodes, and it is rarely showed. i used to love the magic of sabrina and the teenage witch. i never got to see the last episodes, but i do want to know what happened to miles, or josh? and why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good?i'm sure the ending went to be perfect. but there are a lot of questions unanswered. and i want to see the last episode of s.t.t.w! because i heard she decides between erin and harvey on her wedding day! i really hope that she picks harvey! and may i say nate richart is hott!! too bad hes too old for me though. melissa joan hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show, but there are many little "stupid" things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening, its kind of stupid. plus the cat starts to really get lame, as the show continued, the jokes began just to get stupid, and the things that the audio controlled "audience" would laugh at, i would think it was so lame. don't get me wrong, at some parts it was funny, but i think the show just kind of lost its "magic" so to speak as the show went on. i give kudos to all the cast though for trying, although that soleil moon frye girl had no taste, and she was a horrid actress. i wonder what melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter, now that the show has ended.
