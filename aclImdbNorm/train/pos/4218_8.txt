i haven't really seen too many of the columbo films... actually, i think i've only watched one or two, apart from this one. i've always liked columbo, though, somehow without even having seen that much of him. peter falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character, because of his looks, his voice and his charm. the perfect proof of this is that though the series started all the way back in 1968, the latest(and probably not last) of the films was made in 2003. that's 35 years. and falk was 40 back when he made the first one. the series consists of 68 films(unless my count is off), all of which are made for tv. everyone knows the character, even though no one has ever seen a film featuring him in the cinema. that is quite an accomplishment, if you ask me. the plot is pretty good. the only problem i have with it is that the killer and murder is revealed at the very beginning(though that may be the same for all of the columbo films), leaving no mystery but how columbo solves it, making it somewhat dull(since there's not much to look forward to at the end of the film). the pacing is good, there's hardly a scene where you're bored. the acting is very good, particularly that of falk and ruth gordon. they have some great exchanges of dialog in the film. the characters are well-written and credible. the dialog and script is unusually good for a tv-movie. all in all, the film is, yes, surprisingly good for a tv-movie, and definitely worth watching for any fan of columbo and/or crime/mystery flicks. 8/10
