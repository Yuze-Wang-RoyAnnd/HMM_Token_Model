this did for crime what "not another teen movie" did for school. i laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs warred with each other and among themselves. an unsubtle comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way. i suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30's.
