che: part one was a fascinating experiment, which did not only tell a very interesting story, but it also tried to do something different with the "biopic" genre.che: part two is the excellent culmination of this experiment.<br /><br />this movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one, from the extraordinary performances (specially from benicio del toro) to steven soderbergh's brilliant direction, without forgetting its intention of breaking with the conventional rules from the biopics.that is what i admire from soderbergh's experiments...they always try to do something different and unusual, and they succeed most of the times.<br /><br />the final message from this film is perfect, and it includes everything we have been told about che guervara's life.the only fail i found on che: part two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant.<br /><br />in summary, i give che: part two a very enthusiastic recommendation because, as the first one, it is a brave and fascinating experiment which challenges the spectator and leaves us thinking.
