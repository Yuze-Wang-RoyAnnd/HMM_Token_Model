i, myself am a kid at heart, meaning i love watching cartoons, still do! i remember watching bugs bunny when i was a kid, he was my favourite still is. i thought man, this was a great "new" show on tv, and than my dad said, "bugs bunny, i remember watching him when i was younger" and i'm like, "dad, bugs didn't exist when you were younger". so i guess he's definitely pleased more than one generation, possibly 3. i love the show it's great for kids and adults, ok, everybody. it's very funny, me and my husband, both in our 20s, love watching the shows, and we don't mind the re-runs either. this show brings back a lot of memories, happy ones. i love the christmas special too with tweety as tiny tim, it's cute. i can't pick my favourite looney toons character, because they've changed over the years. when i was little it was bugs of course, and porky pig. pepe is cool, i always loved him. actually, i have to say there all my favourite. i'm giving this show a 10 out of 10, because it's a great show for all ages, very funny, voice acting is incredible, the only flaw is that unfortunately it came to an end, 2 decades ago, but the re-runs are great!
