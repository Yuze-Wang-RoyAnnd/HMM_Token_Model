a wonderful early musical film from rene clair, as fun and witty as his silent "the italian straw hat". using sound in a expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, clair influenced early musicals in america (the opera scene from a night at the opera is strongly influenced by le million, for example). should (but won't) be seen by all cinephiles, and the dvd from criterion is exactly as good as you'd expect. there's not a ton of extras, but most dvd extras i've seen are useless fluff, and the clair interview on disc is one i hadn't ever seen. get it while it's still around.
