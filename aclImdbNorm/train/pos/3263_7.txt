ordinarily i really enjoy movies like "chances are," but i wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons. the first half was pretty well done overall, with alex finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body (played by robert downey jr.). he meets up with his wife (cybill shepherd) and friend (ryan o'neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. the scenes with them meeting again and downey rediscovering who he once was are well done, and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated, but from there the film goes downhill. there are several sex-related scenes that turned me off completely, especially downey and shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now. after that, however, the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible, considering the circumstances of the plot. i was disappointed because i did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end. there was great potential with this story, and the scenes in heaven are well done. there is a good theme song sung by peter cetera and cher, but ultimately the film is not great. for a better, similar film, try "heaven can wait." decent, but i really kind of wish i hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half.<br /><br />*** out of ****
