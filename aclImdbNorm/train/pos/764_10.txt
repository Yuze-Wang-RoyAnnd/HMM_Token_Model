without doubt beat street is the best film about the breakin scene. everything about it is spot on,the clothes (puma),the music and most importantly the dancing! the storyline is basic,but hey whats there to tell a story about? the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doing,what mattered to them. it shows that teenagers in general are good,all that mattered to these everyday kids was music,dancing and friendship. having watched the dvd recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time! the clothes didn't look dated (possibly because puma is now having a massive comeback),the music still sounds fresh,and the dancing is still captivating to watch. a film anyone 10-25 years of age should see as part of their youth culture.
