i am proud to say i own an uncut copy of this choice chunk of 70's crown international drive-in sexploitation comedy cheese on dvd. it's a really goofy and enjoyably inconsequential flick with a nicely breezy'n'easy 70's vibe to it. it does attempt to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail. sure, it's essentially a blatant adolescent male fantasy pic -- the main teen goofus character bobby hamilton gets the girls, the respect of his friends, and a chance to show-up a local van-racing bully -- but it's way too dopey and good-natured to hate. stuart getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead, deborah white as the main object of getz's affection is a definite cutie, connie lisa marie is likewise quite luscious as a beauteous blonde babe, and sneering beefcake neanderthal stephan oliver (a 60's biker movie perennial) is wonderfully hateful as the brutish dugan hicks. a pre-stardom danny devito in particular is an absolute riot as getz's cranky carwash owner boss andy, a lovably cantankerous ne'er-do-well slob who wears very ugly loud hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit. i especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat danny up -- one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works over danny's torso! and sammy johns' insidiously catchy fluke hit theme song will be bouncing around your skull for at least a week. in short, it's great groovy retro-70's fun!
