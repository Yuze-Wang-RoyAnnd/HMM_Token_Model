from the view of a nascar maniac like i am, the movie is interesting. you can see many race cars from 1983. even tough, the racing scenes are not that much realistic. but i have to admit, that i haven't seen any race before 1995, because before that time, they didn't show any nascar races in germany)<br /><br />from the view of a burt reynolds fan like i am, the movie basically is what we are used to see from reynolds in the 80's: burt behind the wheel of a fast car, like in his bandit movies.<br /><br />if you love nascar and burt reynolds, this movie is a must-see. if you only love one of this 2 things, i also recommend to watch it. if you like neither nascar nor burt reynolds, you still should give it a chance, but remember, this movie was far away from winning an oscar academy award.<br /><br />it is the typical humor of the 80's. if you like movies like the cannonball movies, and police academy, you will also like that one.
