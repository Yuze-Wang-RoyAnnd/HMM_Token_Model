the ghost train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940's humour. it incorporates world war two into the plot but not as much as i initially believed it would, and the characters are a unique blend who play their roles fairly well. askey, playing the role of tommy gander, is what brightens the story up for the parts which could of been portrayed as boring or "dragging".<br /><br />the story of the haunted station is actually spooky even for present day standards. it is unique and the way the characters communicate with each is fantastic to liven up the mystery which is the ghost train. gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members while the rest get along fairly well. he is always centre of attention and can be dubbed as being "annoying" but that is by those who do not appreciate 1940's humour. his humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watch.<br /><br />if it was not for askey/gander, than this film would of been shorter in action, enjoyment and the result would be not as effective in my opinion.
