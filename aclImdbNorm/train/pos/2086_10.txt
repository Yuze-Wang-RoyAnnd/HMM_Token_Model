faithful to the work of pearl s. buck whose years spent in china as a child of missionary parents that provided her with deep insights into the chinese culture and its philosophy, this film adaptation is brilliantly done, both in technically artistry and acting.<br /><br />wang lung is a humble farmer grateful for the basics of life: to survive off of his land and to be newly wed to olan, a servant to a rich and powerful family in the village area. despite wang lung and olan's best efforts to farm the land, raise kids, and build savings and wealth, a famine threatens to wipe out everything they have worked for. choosing not to sell their land, a traditional asian belief, they instead journey to a major city to wait out the famine. while in the city, they are reduced to begging and being just one of hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families. although not a looter, olan gets caught up in a mob looting at a rich man's house. she's summarily rounded up for execution by the army, but is saved at the last minute. her good fortune, however, is that she found valuable jewels at the looting site that affords her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over again. the newly found wealth transforms wang lung. he becomes selfish, self-centered and takes credit for the find. he becomes a very rich farmer but that only makes matters worse as he increasingly becomes more unappreciative, arrogant and difficult to reason with. he loses touch with the basic things in life that money can't buy: loyalty, commitment, trust, fairness and honesty. as punishment, nature once again turns the table on wang lung by sending a plague of locust to destroy everything he has. brought to his knees, wang lung enlists the aid of all friends, former friends, workers, and family. with all that help, he succeeds in saving the farm. from that experience, he once again returns to humbleness and an appreciation for the basics in life.
