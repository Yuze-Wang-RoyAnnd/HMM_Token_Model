to be fair, i expected car chases in this film. there was only really one, but apart from that, 'freeway' was a great movie which i am glad to own on dvd. the only really big names in the cast are homicide's richard belzer as the radio psychiatrist and b-movie villain par-excellance billy drago as the revelation-quoting freeway killer. but the rest of the cast generally give good performances. i especially liked how darlanne fluegel gave her character, sunny, a bit of guts. she could have been a helpless victim character but she is fully rounded as she seeks out drago with the help of bounty hunter james russo.<br /><br />russo, i'm afraid, comes across as rather wooden, but then again, the character he plays, frank, isn't very well fleshed out save for a back story sunny is given by his former commanding officer. the tone of menace is kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely la freeway at night with the killer prowling its' length in his sinister grey sedan is an excellent way of building tension, and the music used to underscore the film is suitably composed. i don't know why there are some people who hate this movie so. different strokes for different folks, i suppose. but i absolutely enjoyed 'freeway' and i can strongly recommend it.
