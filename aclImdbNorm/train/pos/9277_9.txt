"cinema is dead, long live the cinema!" said peter greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, at the last year's romanian film festival anonimul, which got to the third edition and takes place in the danube delta. this year the direction prize went to jafar panahi's "offside". i got to see it this evening in bucharest at the festival's retrospective. cinema is dead but still very lively. panahi's film tells in a compelling manner how iranian society looks. digitally filmed, "offside" is a story inspired by a real-life event happened to panahi's daughter: the trouble and risk took when decided to attend a football match. this is forbidden in iran as we are informed. what panahi manages to do is to render with few means, but with, probably, a lot of work, intelligence and humor the cultural patterns in a society that places women at a distinct level. the absurdity of the laws becomes comical. the film has a happy end, after all because iran's team goes to the world cup. what i appreciated most was the concept, the idea behind this film. i would be very interested to see panahi's other films that were forbidden in iran as well. i guess that he can be thought as an activist director.
