this movie is actually funny! if you'd like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it. it's called blonde and blonder, so don't expect profound and meaningful jokes. what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. it's just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends (especially if you're not too sober. lol ) pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks. it's a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art. c'mon, this movie is about blondes! it's supposed to be light, funny and superficial. one more thing, i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will.
