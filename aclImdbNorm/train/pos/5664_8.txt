i really like this show. i can readily see how it achieved cult status. it's original, and thought provoking. for some reason though, i have never felt the kind of resonance from it that i could have. it doesn't pack the kind of open door, winter chill that was to be had from such an awesome premise. each time i watch an episode, i find myself prodding, and pushing for it to answer some nameless, formless question.<br /><br />before continuing, let me preface this by saying that what follows is my opinion, and my opinion only. different strokes for different folks.<br /><br />i would have liked to have seen more scenes in "american gothic" that were shot at night. there's too much daylight in this show, and i think it had a tendency to counteract the suspense. we're not afraid of the daylight, after all. we're concerned about what's in the shadows. the devil isn't always in the details. what we're not seeing is often the most frightening.<br /><br />second--and this is the one that's probably going to lead to tar, and feathers: gary cole is a tremendously talented actor...a character actor. i've followed his career from the brady bunch films on, which is why it pains me to say that he was probably miscast as lucas buck. he's almost too petroichan, too likable to be embodiment of evil, even by biblical standards. lucas buck is a narcotic. he's heroin. he's freebasing in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of drain-o. you keep going back, even though you know the end will be madness, and death. he should be like the ultimate loan shark. he's a maker of book, but also of unspeakable condemnation. sure. you've got the money, and before long you're also going to have broken fingers; a severed hand, a decapitated head, and eventually, a damned soul. turning to buck is an act of desperation, and whenever he's around, there should be some immediate, ambient finality--with interest compounded daily--in the air.<br /><br />it's all largess, all strings attached, and by the time you realize that, you'll also know that it's too late.<br /><br />which leads me to three: they showed buck a little too often. he's in most of the scenes, in fact, which may have caused him to lose his edge. the sheriff would be like the next door mythology. he's the apocryphal acquaintance. many would know 'of' him, but only an unfortunate few would really know him. he'd be the stuff of flashbacks, and cryptic conversations, and the perfect person to deliver this plot exposition would have been the deputy character that nick searcy portrayed.<br /><br />four, the show could be very self-reverential--to a fault, some might say--and this is typified by the whistling of "meet me at the fishing hole" in the series pilot. i think we've already established that what cassidy, and raimi were shooting for was the anti-andy taylor. we probably didn't need the concept delivered to us via fed ex. i gathered that within the first five minutes so, for me, the piano on the head was unnecessary.<br /><br />these remarks are all about what, for me, would have made a good show great. i also understand that the producers had their own, unique style, and that there were many hands in the soup. in their everlasting quest for lcd programming, the network played a definite role in the demise of this series.<br /><br />the least these jerk-off suits could have done was to air the episodes in order.<br /><br />get real.<br /><br />either way, it's a grievous loss to both genre fans, and casual viewers alike.
