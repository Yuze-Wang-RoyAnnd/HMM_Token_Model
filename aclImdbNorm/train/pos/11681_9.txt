many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow. although the story-line was rather typical of clara's later silents, i still find it somewhat heart-stirring and incredibly fun. clara plays a happy-go-lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves...never mind that this man is married! clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie. though definitely not a brilliant story-line (quite typical, actually), this movie is a nice showcase of clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
