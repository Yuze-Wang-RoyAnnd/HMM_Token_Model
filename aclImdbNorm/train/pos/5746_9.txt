words are seriously not enough convey the emotional power of this film; it's one of the most wrenching you'll ever see, yet the ending is one of the most loving, tender, and emotionally fulfilling you could hope for. every actor in every role is terrific, especially a wise and understated jamie lee curtis, a tightly wound and anguished ray liotta, and a heart-stopping turn from tom hulce that should have had him up for every award in the book. (he's the #1 pick for 1988's best actor in danny peary's "alternate oscars.") the last half hour borders on melodrama, but the film earns every one of its tears--and unless you're made of stone, there will be plenty of them.
