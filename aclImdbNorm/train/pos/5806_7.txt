if you see this movie, you know you will see an extense video-clip of popular music. but you will find more. incredible fx, great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. if you compare this movie, you have to remember is a pop extravaganza. clips of "man in the mirror", "leave me alone", "smooth criminal" and beatles' "come together".
