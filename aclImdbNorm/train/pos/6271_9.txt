i liked this movie. it was pretty cool. it has it all: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a token girl. it does not excel in any of this things, with the exception of the cars. a bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, and lot's of car, with a great chase near the end. the jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the imdb it is possible, so the movie ain't as bad as people are painting it. it has some quality, and i liked to watch it. in fact, i loved the film. and i didn't need to turn off my brains to watch it. i wasn't always thinking "is this possible?" or tramp like that. 9 in 10.
