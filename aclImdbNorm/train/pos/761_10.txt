i just wanna say that amongst all the so-called classic hiphop films ive seen like wild style, krushgroove, breakin', style wars etc... imo beat street is the best amongst the others. whenever i ask other people about which is their fave, then it seems that beat street pops out the most. but still, its the lowest ranked of all. 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (if say, 5 points is the belt). i love the music performances, the breakdancing makes me wanna spin, ramo makes me wanna throw a piece...c'mon, its a classic!!!
