"that '70s show" is definitely the funniest show currently on tv. i started watching it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as i saw it i could tell it was a great show. i like all the characters, but my personal favorites are fez and kelso. leo was also an awesome character while he was there, i really hope he comes back because he's hilarious. it's classic when fez goes "you son of a bitch!", and when kelso yells "burn!", that always makes me laugh. they are both great characters and always have something funny to say. jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started out being really good looking but damn, somewhere around season 5-6 she just got really hot. i've seen most of the episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and there still hilarious. this is one of the few shows that i can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as i did the first time i saw it. the cast is classic; almost everyone is funny, where with many shows there are only a few funny characters. i will be sad to see this show end next year, but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever.
