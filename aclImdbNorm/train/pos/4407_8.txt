for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate, (which basically satanised the english), it was interesting to see this film. by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in, and they were the only nationality present. it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours. all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict, and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all.
