have just finished watching this film, which upset me greatly. have also been to south africa twice, around the time this film is set.<br /><br />it is certainly hard-hitting, and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene'. the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break, and there are certainly few light moments.<br /><br />will never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again. he came across as a very twisted individual, and i found myself disliking him more each time he appeared.<br /><br />totally agree with steve-thomp's articulate and well thought-out comments.
