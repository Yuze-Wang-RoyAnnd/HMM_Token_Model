i saw this on a flight over to the u.s and was a little sceptical at first as a few people had said there were so many characters in it that you didnt get to know any of them. however i didnt find this at all. the film is fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. the chase scenes are excellent and yes it may be predictable but isnt that true of most films. the main villain is a bit of a let down, christopher eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but that said its still a good film.
