"yokai daisenso" is a children's film by takashi miike, but as you might expect, it's probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones. however, older children may well eat this up, that is, if you play it dubbed in english.<br /><br />the story is that of a young boy, who has moved with his mother to the country, to live with his grandfather, after a divorce. during a village festival the boy is chosen as a "kirin rider", a great honor, but with that honor comes much danger and adventure, of course.<br /><br />meanwhile, evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt, go-go boots & a beehive hair-do, teams up with an evil yokai to turn people's resentments and discarded items against them. and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself, tokyo. one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city...says one, "oh, it's only gamera". <br /><br />the young boy has befriended yokai, which are monsters of a kind, mostly benign, that have isolated themselves away from humans, and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evil.<br /><br />in many ways miike & crew have taken the late 60's/early 70's yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for (older) kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of "transformers". the look and feel of the film is great, the effects are entertaining, and some of the humor will just sail right over kid's heads, but still, older ones might enjoy it. as for adults, there's not much here not to like, if you're a fan of japanese monster movies you'll enjoy the heck out of this.<br /><br />cool & fun stuff, kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just miike..and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
