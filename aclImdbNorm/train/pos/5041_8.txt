matthew mcconaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent wesley doyle (powers boothe) in his fbi office. he claims to have information about a serial killer chased by fbi. when agent doyle arrives in the office, he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother. agent doyle requests some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life, since his childhood. they were a simple family of three: his widow father meiks (bill paxton), his brother and himself. one night, his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of god had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons. what happens next is one of the most scary movie i have ever seen. <br /><br />i watched this movie four months ago on vhs, and yesterday i watched again, now on dvd. although being a low-budget movie, the screenplay is sharp, with no flaw. the cast is outstanding, but i would like to highlight the performance of matt o'leary as the young felton. it is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager. the direction of bill paxton is remarkable. there is no explicit violence in this horror movie. a great debut behind the camera. i regret the brazilian title of this movie: 'a m~ao do diabo' (the devil's hand'). if at least it were 'the god's hand', it might be acceptable. but calling this movie as 'the devil's hand' is indeed ridiculous. brent hanley, the screenwriter, did not deserve such a lack of respect from the brazilian distributor. this film is highly recommended. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): "a m~ao do diabo" ("the devil's hand")
