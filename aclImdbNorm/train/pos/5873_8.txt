this would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen almost anybody else for john abraham. this guy is an awful actor. be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers etc. he stinks. it seemed like at some point priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.<br /><br />he's the only noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an absolutely hilarious movie otherwise. best comedy to come along in bollywood since hungama, imo. like hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course,akshay kumar. this is probably his best performance to date. he better be a shoe-in for best comedian at every award function. ak's always been good at comedy, but he takes it to a different level here. the body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. it's a genius performance. the packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and i don't think i've ever seen such an atmosphere for a bollywood movie here in usa.<br /><br />garam masala doesn't have one "lead" heroine. it stars 3 incredibly hot+beautiful girls who i thought did a fairly good job. pretty sure they are all making their debuts. paresh rawal is solid as usual, although his routine wears itself out after a while. rajpal yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). rimi sen has nothing to do.<br /><br />overall, definitely worth a dekho. i'd say it's funnier than no entry, and that's saying a lot. could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than john abraham.<br /><br />8/10
