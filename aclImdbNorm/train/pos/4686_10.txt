this is by far my favorite film of all time. that's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. however, i don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. sean young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. the other cast members do a fine job as well.<br /><br />have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters? have you ever wondered why? the obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. it seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a mainstream movie like "love crimes". sadly, even though this movie is only 11 years old, it could probably not be made today.<br /><br />
