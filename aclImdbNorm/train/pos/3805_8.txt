after watching the trailer i was surprised this movie never made it into theaters, so i ordered the bluray. i had a great time watching it and have to say that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there. of course, it has its flaws but i can still really recommend it. the animation is well done, very entertaining and unique and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end. some of the backdrops are just drop-dead gorgeous and you can see the french talent behind it. i thought that forest whitaker's performance feels a bit lifeless but that is how the character lian-chu is depicted in this movie. so overall, thumbs up, i liked it a lot and i hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this. i would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget. hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are stitch-like hilarious.
