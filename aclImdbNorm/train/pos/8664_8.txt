steely, powerful gangster supreme frankie diomede (the always terrific lee van cleef in fine rugged form) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection. fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe tony breda (an amiable portrayal by tony lo bianco) gets busted as well. frank and tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. tony helps frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless louis annunziata (smoothly played by jean rochefort). director michele lupo, working from an absorbing script by sergio donati and luciano vincenzoni, relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace, sustains a suitably gritty, but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting brio (a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights). van cleef and lo bianco display a nice, loose and engaging on-screen chemistry; the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching. the ravishing edwige fenech alas isn't given much to do as tony's whiny girlfriend orchidea, but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene. riz ortolani's groovy, pulsating, syncopated funk/jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin' spot. the polished cinematography by joe d'amato and aldo tonti is likewise impressive. a really nifty and entertaining little winner.
