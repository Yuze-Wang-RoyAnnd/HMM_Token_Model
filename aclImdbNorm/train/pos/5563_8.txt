the opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission, as cheech and chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot, filled with gas. "don't spill it man !", hilarious stuff. and then, as 'the plot' ensues, you're in for one heck of a ride. i watched this film recently and it holds up, being just as funny upon each viewing. check it out.
