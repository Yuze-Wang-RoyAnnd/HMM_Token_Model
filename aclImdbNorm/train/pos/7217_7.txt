stage adaptations often have a major fault. they often come out looking like a film camera was simply placed on the stage (such as "night mother"). sidney lumet's direction keeps the film alive, which is especially difficult since the picture offered him no real challenge. still, it's nice to look at for what it is. the chemistry between michael caine and christopher reeve is quite brilliant. the dynamics of their relationship are surprising. caine is fantastic as always, and reeve gets one of his few chances to really act.<br /><br />i confess that i've never seen ira levin's play, but i hear that jay presson allen's adaptation is faithful. the script is incredibly convoluted, and keeps you guessing. "deathtrap" is an enormously entertaining film, and is recommended for nearly all fans of stage and screen.<br /><br />7.4 out of 10
