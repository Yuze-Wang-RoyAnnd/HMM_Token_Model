excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted, ordinary beads exchanged during mardi gras. the film is much more than a commentary on globalization. in fact, it humanizes the workers in china, the owner of the factory, the bead distributor in new orleans, and even the revelers in new orleans. what stands out the most is the director's ability to tell a tricky story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way. his amazing access to the factory is another aspect that's intriguing and i only wish i knew how he got inside. it's a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion provides hope without leaving people feeling alienated.
