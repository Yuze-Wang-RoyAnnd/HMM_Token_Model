philo vance (william powell) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show.<br /><br />usually i hate overly convoluted mysteries (like this) but i love this movie. it moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by michael curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along), has a very ingenious story line (including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible) and has a very good cast. <br /><br />powell is very suave and great as vance--he doesn't seem to be acting--he is vance! mary astor isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production. everybody else is very good too, but best of all is eugene pallette as detective heath. he's a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious.<br /><br />basically, an excellent 1930s hollywood murder mystery. well worth seeing.<br /><br />
