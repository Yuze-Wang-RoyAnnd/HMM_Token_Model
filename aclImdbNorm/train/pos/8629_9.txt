i read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about liebe des totes (the love of the dead) or something similar. this of course awoke my curiosity so i ordered nekromantik 1 & 2 and der todesking (the death king). the nekromantik movies are ok, even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject necrophilia (even if they obviously are horror-opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind, they are actually quite funny.)<br /><br />todesking, on the other hand is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. it consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. death as an enemy; death as a reliever, death as the very fysical decomposition of the body. the film is a metaphor over life. it shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. it reduces its viewers to the childs they (we) actually are. the fact that we cannot really understand the nature of death, and hence neither the process of dying, is the core message of the film. this is a most realistic film. never does buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever. no matter what moral standards you set up, death is unevitable, and will sooner or later be not a fiction but your reality. this applies to you, dear reader, like it applies to the viewers of the film. some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this, which is fully excused, since they of course will live forever...<br /><br />this is no exploitation movie. why? because death does not exploit us humans. it harvests us. we grow for seven days, then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre-birth, that is death. buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales. whether you choose to regard it as "optimistic" or "pessimistic" is up to you. at first glance it may seem very dark. consider though, that in order for something to live, something else must die. "who wants to live forever?"<br /><br />i believe that when buttgereit shows a body, that are being consumed by maggots, he shows not only decomposition, but generation of new life. is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil, than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre?<br /><br />when you realize this, you see der todesking it its right context.<br /><br />sieben tage hat die woche, siebenmal letzte stunden. seven are the days of week (weak, mortal !), seven times the last hour.<br /><br />dont fear the reaper, buttgereit tells us, because the reaper takes only what is ripe. and apples that are not plucked for food will rot!<br /><br />have a good life, fellow imdb'ers !<br /><br />(and watch this film, that compares only to ingemar bergmans "the seventh seal" in terms of depth and universality)
