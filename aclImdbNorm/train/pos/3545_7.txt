big splashy film of the broadway music. nathan (frank sinatra) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games. blonde loving adelaide (vivian blaine) wants to marry him if he gives up craps. he decides on one last game when sky masterson (marlon brando!), who bets big, is in town. he bets sky that he can't get mission worker sarah brown (jean simmons) to go with him to havana. that may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie!<br /><br />this is a real mixed bag--there's some wonderful stuff here. the songs are all good and the dancing is incredible. the real show stopper is at the crap game at the end. also brando is really quite good here--it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off. i have to admit seeing big, bulky brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun! also sinatra is pretty good and blaine is just wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend. her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here.<br /><br />now for the bad parts--jean simmons is a wonderful actress but she's stuck with a drab colorless role and can't do much with it. the movie is far too long at 150 minutes--the scenes between brando and simmons really drag and should have been shortened. also most of the characters speak in very precise english--contractions are never used. maybe it's trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but i found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie.<br /><br />it's worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while. i give it a 7.
