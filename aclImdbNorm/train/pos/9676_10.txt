the movie was very sweet and heartwarming! i cry almost every time i watch the movie. i would recommend this movie for every one. the movie was so inspiring to me. the actors did a great job of acting, and the movie was very well played and done. the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie. paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her.<br /><br />after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement. finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor. had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life. in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie (the little girl who raised paulie). love overcame all the obstacles.
