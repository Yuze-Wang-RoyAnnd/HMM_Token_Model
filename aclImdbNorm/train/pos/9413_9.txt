in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time. the theme of workers v. management (with lots of talk of unions and rights) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesn't stop "white suit" from being a show stopping classic.<br /><br />the plot, about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil, doesn't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy. the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out! the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences, such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall! the script itself is full of dry wit - "is he all right?" "yes." "pity." - and characterisation is first rate. i'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well. comedies of later eras would adopt a "point the camera at the actors and let it roll" mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations. this film is no exception.<br /><br />of course, it's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights. alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance, with eyes that convey wonder, joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it. stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work. such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable, so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything he's ever worked for. joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual, as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough; everybody gets laughs without even trying to. it's comical british understatement at its finest.<br /><br />"the man in the white suit" is 81 minutes of sheer brilliance, with a great plot, great cast, sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism. absolutely top notch.
