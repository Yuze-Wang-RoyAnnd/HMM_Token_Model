all i can say is, if you don't fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie, then you're not human! even after watching it for the first time, i was hooked. it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe, as i'm sure other fans will attest to. after watching it, you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. at least we have grey gardens to remember them! i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with. although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy, she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do. what a rare treat to have know such people; i only wish i had!
