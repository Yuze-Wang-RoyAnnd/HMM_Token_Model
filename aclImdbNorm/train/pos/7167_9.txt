i couldn't keep from commenting after reading the very short "not bad" commentary. this movie is much better than just not bad. the acting is stellar, even from the children in the cast, who don't play cute or anything else but act just like my son's friends. the movie is smart and expects it's audience to be as well. the double back flash story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as time filler. i watched this movie with my kids and then i watched it again by myself a few days later. if you have kids and are sick to death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, then check out "holes." my 6-year-old enjoyed it as much as my 11-year-old, and my husband and i enjoyed it as much as the two of them. how many movies can you say that about?
