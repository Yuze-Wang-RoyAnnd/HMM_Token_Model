- small spoiler herein! - <br /><br />when i looked at the votes for "creep" today, i was surprised about so many imdb-users rating this movie "1". i am wondering: what do people expect of such kind of movie? are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it?<br /><br />"creep" is a horror movie and it is a pretty good one! this automatically means: it has a absurd story full of holes, outrageous hazards and simple one-side-characters. so why complain about it? just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat and then... ...enjoy to be scared to death! the first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring. there is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you. (in my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie.)<br /><br />when kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still doesn't become a bad movie. the second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed. (...as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the discovery channel!) so, if you want to make yourself a very, very scaring hour. just watch the first hour of "creep" and then leave the cinema or turn of your tv. you know the rest of the story anyway, don't you? the bad guy will die and kate will be the only survivor. but even if you watch this movie up to its end, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />...and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what i did after watching this movie: leave the cinema by dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home...
