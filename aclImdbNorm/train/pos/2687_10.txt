no other movie has made me feel like this before... and i don't feel bad. like, i don't want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie (9 months) nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this ______. the reason i say "_____" is because no matter how hard i wrack my brain i just can't seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up. i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a breather. no movie has ever done this to me before. never in my life have i wanted cauliflower, milk, and baguettes this much. thank you. - ed<br /><br />uh. *clears throat* no words. no thoughts. i don't know. i truly don't know. - cait
