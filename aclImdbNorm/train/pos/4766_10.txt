it is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest, if any, without his presence.<br /><br />despite a not outstanding direction - in fact, there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly -, a seemingly low budget, a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points, the presence of pierre fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end.<br /><br />i have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance, even paul scofield acting in "a man for all seasons".<br /><br />actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to church by performing a crime.<br /><br />"je suis maurice morand, pr`etre catholique" ("i am maurice morand, a catholic priest")is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end.<br /><br />the other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich morand - who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest - consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into christ's blood.<br /><br />g'erard - the man that wants to return morand to the church or replace him by himself - has to drink it if he doesn't want to leave it in the cabaret. he does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine.<br /><br />in next scene, the dialoque between morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable. "do you carry away men too?" asks morand, who hates himself for what he has just done. "that would be too much work" is the smart answer.<br /><br />the rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time.<br /><br />i think that "le d'efroqu'e" is a very strange film, but has to be seen by all viewers - if the are good catholiques it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewell in film history.<br /><br />
