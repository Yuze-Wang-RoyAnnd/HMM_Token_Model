certainly one of the finest movies i have seen for quite some time. exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. denzel washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. christopher walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as i would have liked. a story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. this is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. the location of mexico city adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. all in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end. highly recommended!
