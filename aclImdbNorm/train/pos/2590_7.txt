the people who are bad-mouthing this film are those who don't understand film to begin with. these are the people who love movie blockbusters and adverse to any movie that doesn't star leonardo dicaprio. wilder napalm is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first, but what it lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in substance.<br /><br />one thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was it's use of music, which plays a large part. those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie, both in vida and wilder's life, and in the background. wilder's theme, vida's theme, and wallace's theme are all heard in the opening sequence, and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out. for instance, in the scene where the men are singing "duke of earl", vida is with wilder when the men sing something like "she is my girl", and then she goes over to wallace to give him something when the men sing the lyric "she will be my girl" cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers there are all sorts of little intricacies like this inside the movie, and while it may look like a flop on the outside, the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is.
