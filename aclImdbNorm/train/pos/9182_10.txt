those who love the book jane eyre as i do (it's my all time favorite, and i re read it at least once a year) will love this version. timothy dalton is just a tad too good looking to be mr. rochester, but other than that, he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of thornfield. zelah clarke may have been just a little too old to play the 18 year old jane, but when i watch this movie, i don't think about the ages of the characters. the dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book, which was very smart. sure, this film might seem a little long, but it's the only version i've seen that includes part 3 of the story.<br /><br />i wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer zeferelli version, as it would have helped that mess of a film.<br /><br />i also realized the last time i watched this video that judy cornwell plays "aunt reed"! she is so versatile that i didn't recognize her. she plays daisy in keeping up appearances, and also played mrs. musgrove in 1995's persuasion (another wonderful adaption).<br /><br />update: got the dvd this week, and it's marvelous to see the original unedited version. there's lots more at the beginning (young jane at gateshead and at lowood.) and at the end, they've restored lots of things, (i always wondered why st. john had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who jane is-- because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the us vhs version!). rosamund oliver is in it...she was completely cut out of the vhs. as far as i could tell, they hadn't edited out any of timothy dalton's parts, so nothing new there, but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the vhs. thanks, bbc (ps...i would have paid more for a special edition dvd...with maybe some interviews with the stars...or a making of show)
