look, this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world. to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself. i remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty. the economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. out of that confusion came a hero, stroker ace. ned beatty's performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness. his triumph is an inspiration to all. the on-screen chemistry between burt and loni draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer. jim nabors is a poet. go see this movie tonight!
