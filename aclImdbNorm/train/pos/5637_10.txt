i'd just like to say that i've seen this film twice now and i love it! the acting is great and even though it is a similar plot to "raise your voice" i think that the plot never gets boring for people who like that kind of thing. it has some great lessons in it and shows us that we can do anything if we try. an incredible film. i am sure that this is one i will be watching for a long time to come. even though britney spears write the book it is quite a realistic plot, maybe not about the falling in love part, but the part about being different and struggling but coming out best in the end is very true to real life. the only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful? do you really think that holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or average? i doubt it..
