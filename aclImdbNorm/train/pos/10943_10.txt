i have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review, takes pity on me, whisks me to hollywood and involves me in her freaky/funny world. but in all seriousness, it was good. first episode is obviously finding it's feet, but it's got that silverman weirdness running all the way through it. it's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy, but that's good thing, too much has a laughter-track to it, and this wouldn't be right with cues when to laugh, it's to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all. i can easily see this as being the bizarro drew carey show with it's weird characters and incredibly strong central character. well worth a watch, look forward to the following episodes. a very good chance from the usual comedy out there. <br /><br />ps, sarah? call me....
