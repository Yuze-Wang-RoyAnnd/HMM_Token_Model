such a film of beauty that it's hard to describe. maybe it's the absence of superfluous dialogue, or maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just meena mumari's feet, but it's a joy to watch this movie again and again. i've never seen another indian movie that comes close to it, and few from any country rival its perfection.
