this is a modest, character driven comedy, filmed in brazil on a low budget. the premise is familiar, the same as in the 1950's danny kaye movie **on the double**: someone who, as a joke, does an impression of a famous person then is dragooned to impersonate the person for real.<br /><br />the contrast between the two leads is highly effective. raul julia as the german-paradorian secret policeman, is tall, cool, menacing and latin. he sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job. richard dreyfus, animated, short, new york jewish, is funny and sympathetic. there are many references and inside jokes about show business.<br /><br />the setting is clearly modeled on paraguay. paraguay was indeed ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by gen. alfredo stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from germany. but writer/director mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints parador/paraguay as a typical latin american tyranny, with huge disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency. further in this vein, mazursky casts comic jonathan winters as an american retiree who in truth is c.i.a. station chief in parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a profanity-laced chewing out. <br /><br />in fact the u.s. has little influence in paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. this is due to the country's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. the male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united. <br /><br />on yet another level, there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character madonna. played by brazilian actress sonia braga, madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body-stockinged presidential pleasure girl at the film's start but is seen on television as president herself at the end--now politically and cosmetically correct, no makeup, hair demurely pulled back, swept to office by a velvet revolution.<br /><br />the one time that such an event actually happened in latin america, the administration of argentina's isabel peron (not the beloved evita, who never held office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, legendary **supremo** juan peron.
