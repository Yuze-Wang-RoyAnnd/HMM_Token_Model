psychotic transsexual bobbi murders the patient (angie dickinson) of a prominent doctor (michael caine) and then pursues the high-priced prostitute (nancy allen) who caught a glimpse of bobbi in the elevator. liz (allen) comes under suspicion of the crime and teams up with the patient's son (keith gordon) to catch the killer.<br /><br />it can be summed up in a couple of words: it's very sexy (dickinson and allen look great), it's very bloody - with the kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies, and boy is it well crafted. writer / director de palma's script is ok but it really takes a backseat to the man's film-making abilities. it is highly successful on a visceral level and i actually get involved / interested with these characters. i can notice the standard de palma homages to / ripoffs of hitchcock - at least from one of the master's pictures.<br /><br />and to top it all off, it has a professional and believable cast.<br /><br />this was de palma's third movie with ex-wife nancy allen (after "carrie" and "home movies".)<br /><br />by the way, dancer-turned-actress rachel ticotin was one of the production assistants. there's a bit of trivia for you.<br /><br />i wouldn't think a thriller could be classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it off.<br /><br />one of the best things about it is a typically striking pino donaggio music score.<br /><br />8/10
