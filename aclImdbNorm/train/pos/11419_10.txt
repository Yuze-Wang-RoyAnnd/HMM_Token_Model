claire denis' debut is both a brave and self-assured one. in this depiction of life towards the end of french colonialist cameroon, she explores the relationships between men and women, black and white.<br /><br />with the black servant 'prot'ee' as the film's primary object of desire and oppression, the film enters taboo territory from the beginning. denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed to the screen. the mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camera-work and (lack of) lighting.<br /><br />a great discourse.
