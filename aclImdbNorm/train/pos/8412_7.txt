those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on. this is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to satan for a lot of money. unfortunately, the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently, tearing his life apart. there are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and, of course, the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time. the middle part is a bit dull, but the faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer. one thing i have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie. also, they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing. i first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it. i was not disappointed.
