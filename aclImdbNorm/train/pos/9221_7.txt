once again, i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4.88. fifty-percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap (i mean horrible beyond belief) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. this movie is much better than i expected. i found it very engaging, though it was obviously made by an amateur.<br /><br /> the direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good thrills. i expected it to be more of a comedy, but i wasn't too disappointed.<br /><br /> for a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. there's no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. usually, these movies require all four of those elements. the pg rating is well-deserved--not like "sixteen candles" where the "f" word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene.<br /><br /> i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could've been developed more. the film does tend to be plot-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side. instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them, we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors. they end up kissing at the end, but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced.<br /><br />"the dream machine" is no gem, but it's good, clean entertainment. it's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns, except for haim--but it's also much better than you'd expect.<br /><br /> my score: 7 (out of 10)
