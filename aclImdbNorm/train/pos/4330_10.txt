<br /><br />"bleak house" is hands down the finest adaptation of a charles dickens novel ever put on screen. alway one of my favorite novels,i was exteremely pleased with this television mini series. the late, great denholm elliot was perfectly cast as the noble john jardyce and diana rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed ladty dedlock. the film captures the essence of dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book,oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story. over all a brilliant,moving and atmosphereic film.
