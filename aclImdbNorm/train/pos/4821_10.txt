one of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in, it ends much to soon! than were left looking at the screen like, "no they didn't!", lol. good performances all around! the acting is marvelous with emily blunt simply outstanding! i knew she would give a solid, convincing performance catching young victoria's regality, temper, and vulnerability through out the entire movie. also, the production is outstanding in every way: style, substance and sensitivity. a remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in britian's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as queen, later marrying prince albert, than ending with the birth of their first of nine children. it had a well written screenplay and flawless editing. rupert friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young prince albert vying to win the young queen's attention, than securing her love, before lord melbourne(paul bettany), was engrossing to watch. just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage victoria and her mother, which was fury at times, as with her mother and king william (whom also disliked her mother). the acting and scenes were captivating, highly emotional. <br /><br />i would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era, and indeed, anyone who loves a compelling true romance story
