ashanti is a very 70s sort of film (1979, to be precise). it reminded me of the wild geese in a way (richard burton, richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa). it's a very good film too, and i enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />david (michael caine) is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa (beverley johnson) who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor. while they're doctoring, one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman (played perfectly by peter ustinov, of all people). the rest of the film is david trying to get her back.<br /><br />michael caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back, but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff. he's helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on (rex harrison!), then briefly by a helicopter pilot (william holden), and then by an arab called malik (kabir bedi). malik has a score to settle with suleiman (he is very intense throughout, a very engaging character), and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camel.<br /><br />then there's lots of adventure. there's also lots of morality-questioning. the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point, and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster, but it's all pretty forgivable. the question is, will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif (yes, of course omar sharif is in it!)?
