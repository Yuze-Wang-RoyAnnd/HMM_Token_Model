this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre. told completely without dialogue, it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish, lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school, leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open. after a while, a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around, comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl. the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited. as the cat comes very near to the bowl, the fish jumps out. the cat catches the fish, drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy, not knowing what has happened, gets back. this was amazingly filmed with real animals; how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable. i only wish this film were available now for people to see; i only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it has remained unforgettable.
