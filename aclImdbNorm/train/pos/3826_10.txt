i love korean films because they have the ability to really (quiet eerily really) capture real life. i tend to watch korean movies just for that reason alone. i've seen this directors other movies before. the one that comes closest to the feelings i got from this is oasis and another awesome film called this charming girl.<br /><br />however, my title summary is supposed to be from a chrstian perspective so i'll just start doing that instead of just showering it with praise.<br /><br />for a non christian perspective director chang-dong lee has captured an unbiased and almost eerily real portrayal of a modern protestant church (regardless of denomination) warts and all. i've always been waiting for a christian film that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life. because christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to. many films with religious undertones, though having good motives, tend to just have the resonance of a disney film or after school special. they need to show life as it is. real people curse, real people lust, real people fall. and though christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it, we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life. and do-yeon jeon's character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found god, but because of life's bitter realities, loses that love for him she once had. she doesn't deny god exists. it is just that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that he is an all loving and forgiving god.<br /><br />in her decent to the edges of morality and madness, her character asks questions that are in the mind of every one, religious or not.<br /><br />"if god is love, why does he allow such terrible things to happen?" this film doesn't answer that, rightly so. and i believe the last 10 minutes of the film, though open to interpretation, leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of "secret sunshine" full circle.<br /><br />i don't believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that. there in lies the reason why it worked even more. it's real, it's honest. and because of that, it is by far the best summation of a real christian life i have seen on film.
