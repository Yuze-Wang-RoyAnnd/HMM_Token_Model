if you didn't enjoy this movie, either your dead, or you hate adam sandler or don cheadle.<br /><br />an excellent cast, all of who gave good performances. this movie proved that adam sandler is good actor, despite what critics say. adam sandler is becoming a very well respected actor. it all started with his performance in big daddy, then he did a couple bad movies, then he broke through with terrific performance in 50 first dates, the longest yard, then click, and now reign over me.<br /><br />back to the movie. adam sandler plays a man who has lost everything. the closest thing to family he has are a mother-in-law and father-in-law. after his old college roommate (cheadle) ran into him, he seems to turn his life around. i will say no more, because i do not want to ruin the movie, but i strongly recommend this movie. one of the best movies of 2007.
