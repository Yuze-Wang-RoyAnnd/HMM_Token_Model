even though it has one of the standard "revenge price plots," this film is my favorite of vincent price's work. gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters- likeability. when you watch it, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance, even though he frightens you a little with his original fury. as the film goes on, his character becomes tragic. he's committed his murder, but now he must kill to cover that up. and again to cover that one up. and again... your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral- like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood. even if the revenge story is of old, the plot devices themselves are original- gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. a shame this one isn't available for home veiwing.
