while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end, i wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5. i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on. even my a.d.d couldn't keep up. it felt like a slight acid trip. everything looked flat, there was no dimension to anything. there were so many shapes, lines and patterns. i really wanted to stop the movie mid-way and smash my burned copy of this movie. but after i finish watching it, i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watching.<br /><br />the secret of kells is loosely based on the true story about the original book of kells. a small boy, brendan, is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written. this book will contain information that will help "change darkness into light." brendan lives in the village of kells behind huge stone walls. taking place in the 8th century, brendan's uncle, the abbot of kells, is trying to build the wall to keep the vikings out. brendan's uncle insist he help complete the wall, but a traveler and keeper of "the book" secretly trains brendan to hone in on his illustration skills, and convinces him to complete "the book" and carry out it's word.<br /><br />the entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didn't really understand what was going on. i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history. a simple google search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of kells. after reading many articles, my opinion of the movie greatly changed.<br /><br />the book of kells is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament transcribed into latin by gaelic monks in ireland in the 8th century. along with it's paleographic and insular script, the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art, a type of early art form know for it's intricacy, complexity, and miniature illustrations. much of the art in the book of kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time, flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective. but what makes the book of kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it's use of many colors.<br /><br />the secret of kells is very colorful. i originally thought the animation was flat and boring. it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and "amine" look to it. once i learned about the art styles of the book of kells, it's obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie. there are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit brendan's mind. whenever he goes into his imagination, circular shapes resembling the sun, cogs, clocks and wheels begin filling the screen. the edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles. transitions are filled with color, and celtic knots. from the trees to the floors, many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns.<br /><br />clocking in at 70 minutes minus credits, the secret of kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people (maybe just children) interested. i think one has to generally be open-mined to the secret of kells as half art piece, half movie about history. despite looking like it was animated with adobe illustrator, it's a very nice looking movie. but based on the 20 films submitted for oscar consideration, i don't think it was worth being nominated over mary and max.<br /><br />thatwasjunk.blogspot.com
