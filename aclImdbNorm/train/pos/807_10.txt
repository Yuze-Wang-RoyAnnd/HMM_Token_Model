dear readers,<br /><br />the final battle between the rebellion and empire. the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance. luke skywalker, now a jedi knight, returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia, now revealed as luke's twin sister! they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star. little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death star.<br /><br />return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. it's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by john williams. mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight, gone is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a calm, relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy. leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando. 3p0, r2, and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema's greatest villain: darth vader. ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine. the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty. john williams's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels.<br /><br />signed, the constant dvd collector
