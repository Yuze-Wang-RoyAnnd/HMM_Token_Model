10/10 for this film.<br /><br />i'm a british india doctor, currently in india. the word beckham put me off, 'cos i'm a die hard liverpool fan, and personally think that owen is really cool. since liverpool and man utd are rivals, i was dead sure that i wouldn't watch the film.<br /><br />but then i was in delhi to meet some friends, and i had an early morning flight, so i thought, "what the heck, let's bide time by watching this film", 'cos it was a late night show.<br /><br />what a moron i was. i should've seen this film the day it was released. i guess using beckham's name was to draw audience attraction (which had back-fired in my case!!!), but then i really can't think of a better title for the film.<br /><br />and nagra, knightley (drop dead gorgeous), and rhys-myers did a superb job.<br /><br />if you hate football, dislike manchester united (or england for that matter), then this is definately the film for you. in fact, i'm just 29 yrs old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a kid at heart. this film has knocked "star wars" off my no.1 position.<br /><br />surprisingly, there aren't very many comments on this film by indian-brits like me. i wonder why?<br /><br />10/10 for this film.
