this is one of the best military films ever made. and it is great because of its focus on values. it's a great human interest story that turns on a commitment to honor, loyalty, love, and determination.<br /><br />gooding and deniro are superb in the lead roles. it's wonderful to see the master chief's racism evolve toward respect and love through carl brashear's determination, drive,and yes, sense of honor. the title indicates the source of their bond. i never noticed until this last time watching it how brilliant carl lumbly's portrayal of carl's father, mac brashear, was. in a way, it's a cornerstone of the film in that it's carl's memory of his father that helps carry him through hard times.<br /><br />i am selective about what films i purchase. this is one of those rare ones that i want on my shelf. it will be seen many times in the future, i'm sure.
