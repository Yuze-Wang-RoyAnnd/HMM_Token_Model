watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line, the excellent character development, and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole.<br /><br />without giving away too much of the plot, it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons. along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves. <br /><br />the story has a prologue about what dancing in japan symbolizes sociologically, so it isn't exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the u.s. <br /><br />the film is lighthearted; you'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags. yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe. all of the film's characters are taken seriously, as they are, and none are diminished because of their "imperfections."<br /><br />i've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends. it just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance. is this synchronous or what? i think so because now i'm really geeked to give it a try. <br /><br />watch this wonderful family film (small children might not get it, but teens certainly would) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again.<br /><br />why they would make a remake of shall we dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as-is.
