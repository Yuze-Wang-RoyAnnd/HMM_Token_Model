thats my bush is first of all a very entertaining show by parker and stone, i thought. its often very very funny, and its quite subversive and crazy. south park fans would surely get something here. <br /><br />another surprise is the production value here. a lot of money must have been put into this, and it shows. a lot of expensive little details. its not a little show. and comedy central is not an extremely rich channel, but they put a lot into this show obviously. in a way i understand that was the death of the show as well though, too costy. it surely could have been done cheaper and went on the will was there. <br /><br />the critics liked it, and it had its little fanbase, but it failed gaining a big audience. as we know, the show stopped after 8 episodes, which i guess is almost 1 season. <br /><br />as i really liked the show it has its faults. the problem of the show is kind of that it doesn't know what it wants to be really. its like it tries to be a sitcom and a parody of a sitcom at the same time. the actors do a good job, and some of them are well casted, but in my opinion they seem to not always get 100% the bizarre humor they're supposed to present. <br /><br />i personally think that the show needed some characters that were more down to earth for the show to work. in south park you have kyle and stan, that are kind of a realistic touch in the more looney universe. i think thats kind of what makes south park work. you need some sane characters that you can relate to in a realistic way, and that makes the insane stuff so much more interesting too because that forces you to take them seriously at some level. if everything is archetypes and stereotypes its difficult to get emotionally included in the show, which really is thats my bush biggest problem. kyle and stan is characters in south park that makes sense of the insanity in the show. we have nothing like that here, and this show suffers from it. <br /><br />another anchorpoint is parker and stones flirting with republicans. its the only thing about them i don't really get what they're trying to do. not portraying bush as nothing else than a dumb homer simpsons lovable kind of character is kind of subversive in a world where a lot of people that can't stand him and think he's the worst president since nixon, and a parallel comedy world of letterman and so on that only satirizes his every move... but its difficult to understand if parker and stone actually means anything by it. its like the joke is on us, but somehow it doesn't hit the mark. it seems awkward, because it doesn't remind you of the real bush at all. <br /><br />besides that i actually thought the show was very enjoyable. some of the jokes in here are hilarious. the pro-life supporter who was a surviving aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes by them in any show. and the show is packed with great material, and is sometimes insanely funny if you use your head a little while watching it.
