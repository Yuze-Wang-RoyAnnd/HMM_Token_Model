as the godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite, this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man's point of view. if you've never watched this show, you're in for an extended treat. yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast tony soprano, the thinking man's gangster, with the reality of the life he has been born to and, quite frankly, would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up. tony soprano can discuss sun tzu with his therapist, then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage, and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch tv while eating peanut butter out of the jar, and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a sunday afternoon of viewing nfl football. even carmella, his wife, when given a chance for a way out, finds that she really prefers life with tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own. if you followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. if you didn't, trust me you've never seen a tv show end like this.
