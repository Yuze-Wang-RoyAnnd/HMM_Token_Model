refreshing `lost' gem! featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them. the douglas and widmark characters are realistic heroes. palance is his usual evil presence. widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene, a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a `logical' end, and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary hollywood. you know how it will likely end, but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout. the end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see. the film seems to slow a little past the middle, but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion.
