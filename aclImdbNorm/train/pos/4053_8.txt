i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me. laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the u.s. to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences, has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production conan. in fact, pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of conan--who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running. this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch. the techie fans of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputa--the only exception may be the robot. unlike princess mononoke and valley of the winds, the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism. if it has a theme at all it's anti-warfare. the importance of living naturally--this is related with the flying castle, is dismissably shortly discussed, and not really followed through. overall, i now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny.
