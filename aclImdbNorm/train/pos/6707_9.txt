i know sometimes its really really corny... but the acting is amazing and melissa joan hart is as cute as a button. i love this show a lot, and i'm almost embarrassed that i do b/c the show has a rep. for being really corny, but it makes me feel good. my only problem is that sometimes it can be pretty low budget - sometimes actors change and you just have to deal with it... like sabrina's father is 2 different guys throughout the course of the movie... i mean, couldn't they just say he was an uncle or something? still, i can't help but loving this show. harvey and sabrina make a really cute couple and salem is absolutely hilarious. i definitely recommend it if your looking for some light and funny entertainment... my favorite episode is "pancake madness"... a hilarious episode. the best season is probably 3... i'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season twists... once you get to college, morgan joins the group and her dialog is painful and very poorly acted... plus she is ugly, so the jokes about how she is only surviving off her good looks were lost on me... but i think it was set up to have a really good eighth season and i was really sad to see one of my favorite shows canceled!
