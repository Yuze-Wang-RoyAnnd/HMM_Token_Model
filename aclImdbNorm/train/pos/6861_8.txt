when you compare what brian de palma was doing in the 80's to what passes for entertainment today, his films keep looking better and better. "dressed to kill, "blow out", "body double", "scarface" and "carlito's way" are all superb works of a cinematic craftsman at the peak of his powers. the guy had a long run of better than average films. this is pure hitchcock with an 80's dash of lurid perversion, an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists, huge helpings of style, a stunning pino donaggio score, and a trashy, giallo-inspired plot. de palma's love of complex camera-work and luscious, blood-smudged visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of dennis franz, keith gordon (a good director in his own right), nancy allen (de palma's wife at the time) and michael caine make every scene special. let the virtuoso take you on a surreal, scary, erotically charged odyssey and you'll enjoy every frame of "dressed to kill".
