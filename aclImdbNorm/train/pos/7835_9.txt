i saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in n"urnberg, and it was superb. i do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion/xylophone player influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic nibelungen saga.<br /><br />if you are interested in silent films or in the nibelungenlied, i highly recommend this film. the costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic, and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical of silent film "tragedies") unfortunately, i have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns siegfried. the story of this second film begins after siegfried's death, when kremhild (gudrun in the norse versions of the story) begins to plan her revenge against her brothers.<br /><br />also, i watched this film in german; i am a native english speaker and have a basic german knowledge. it was difficult to read the ?subtitles (what do you call that in silent films?) at first because of the old style german script, so i advise that if you watch it in german that you make sure you can differentiate your "k's", "f's", and "s's" in the old script. :)
