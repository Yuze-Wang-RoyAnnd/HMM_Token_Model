the world is made up two different types of moviegoers... there are the "english patient" types, who can't be bothered to enjoy anything that isn't high-brow enough to be shown on pbs, and there are the "happy gilmore" types, for whom an hour and a half of genitalia puns are definitely worth the $7.<br /><br />certainly, there's a ton of gray area, but you know to which side you're leaning. if you're an english patient person, save your time, save your money, and save us all your "oh, this movie is so childish and stupid" comments. i know, you thoroughly enjoy belittling every movie you don't like, and every person that likes them, but maybe you could hold off just this once.<br /><br />but if you're a happy gilmore type... go see this one... you'll find it hilarious. tim meadows has created a hilarious character, and will farrell continues to be hilarious in just about everything he does. go check it out. you'll be glad you did. and that's ok.
