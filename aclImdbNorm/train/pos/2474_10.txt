there were a lot of things going against this movie for me before i watched it.<br /><br />first, i was a typical high school senior, in a shakespeare class i didn't really even like, much less understood half of! shakespeare would be no more than unintelligible without me pouring all my concentration into his almost encrypted plays... encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language.... and then i still wouldn't get most of it.<br /><br />second, it was 4 hours long! i never thought that could be a good thing.<br /><br />well let me tell you something. this movie was so masterful, so beautiful, i actually understood all the language as it was being performed. now, the script was followed to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in shakespeare class. and here i was my mind opening and me understanding it. i was doubting myself while watching the movie almost! but lo and behold... when performed, and only then, shakespeare comes to life. so this version of hamlet showed me that shakespeare is indeed a master, who wrote great stories. when i saw it on the big screen, especially in the high budget major motion picture style (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and acted amazingly by brannagh and cast, somehow.... i understood what was going on. what was being said. the language is awesome and passionate. it allows for more raw emotion... when words can't describe something, maybe shakespeare's words can.<br /><br />i still hold to this day that fist of the north star (animated, english dub) is the greatest movie ever made. no movie provides more sheer entertainment. but for a movie to come close to dethroning fist from that position (which hamlet did -- it came close) is truly amazing.... awe inspiring. it wasn't a movie. it was an event.<br /><br />even more amazing, it made me appreciate shakespeare. wow. powerful. powerful is the word. one of the rare, truly powerful movies out there.<br /><br />this gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars. yes yes.<br /><br />by the way, all you kids out there in a shakespeare class... forget it. you're wasting you're time. you have to see the plays performed. only then will justice be done to them.
