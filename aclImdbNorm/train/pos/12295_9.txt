"hotel du nord " is the only carn'e movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by jacques pr'evert,but by henri jeanson.janson was much more interested in the jouvet/arletty couple than in the pair of lovers,annabella/aumont.the latter is rather bland ,and their story recalls oddly the edith piaf's song "les amants d'un jour",except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one.what's fascinating today is this popular little world ,the canal saint-martin settings.<br /><br />this movie is dear to the french movies buffs for another very special reason.the pimp jouvet tells his prot'eg'ee raymonde he wants a change of air(atmosph`ere) because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosph`ere,the whore raymonde (wonderful arletty)thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line,that is ,undeniably,the most famous of the whole french cin'ema:<br /><br />in french :"atmosph`ere?atmosph`ere?est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosph`ere?" translation attempt:"atmosphere?atmosphere?have i got an atmosphere face? this is our french "nobody's perfect".
