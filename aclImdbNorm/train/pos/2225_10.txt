i am completely shocked that this show had been cancelled.ity only lasted one year.i just recently started watching it and i love it.its a show that could of gone as far as friends went.it had the humour and was extremely enjoyable.<br /><br />it is about 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under one roof without their parents.kurt(joey lawrence) plays the part of the oldest sibling and takes on the more fatherly role.<br /><br />this should of lasted much more than year as it was fantastic. amazing show with all the best actors.<br /><br />10/10
