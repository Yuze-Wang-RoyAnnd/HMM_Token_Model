this is one of the best reunion specials ever, with adam west and burt ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it. it's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail, particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960's era, the batcave set, wayne manor, the costumes, and the actors selected to play the younger versions of west, ward, burgess meredith, cesar romero, and frank gorshin! this 90 minutes is well worth your time, and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960's "batman" television series. i note that clips from "batman" were from the movie, and not the series itself, probably because of legal restrictions. let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on dvd.
