i just watched "the last wave" in my school's fine arts library. it's intriguing, like all peter weir's stuff, but it's not always as attention-holding as i would have liked. i found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me (because they are very well handled by the film's director weir)but at the same time i was not stimulated enough by them. aka i got a little bored in spots.<br /><br />the plot surrounds an aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has which link him to an aborigone group he is defending.<br /><br />it starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout (most notably the bizarre, "belching" sound design)and strong direction; but it just didn't entertain me like weir's later films do. i might just need to watch it again though.<br /><br />good film about obsession and mystery. because, in the end, the mystery that exists between the whites and the aboriginies offers some very severe consequences.<br /><br />god bless peter weir, though. for him alone this film is worth watching ... very organic director. like an aussie response malick! i'd give it a 7 because it's got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments.
