i saw this film on true movies (which automatically made me sceptical) but actually - it was good. why? not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue (of which there is little) but because actually, despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in it's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy.<br /><br />it's not dawson's creek, they're not graceful, cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge. they're kids and they act like kids would. <br /><br />they're blunt, awkward and annoyingly confused about everything. yes, this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don't think so. dermot mulroney gives (when not trying to be cool) a very believable performance and i loved him for it. patricia arquette is whiny and annoying, but she was pregnant and a teenagers? the combination of the two isn't exactly lavender on your pillow. the plot was very predictable and but so what? i believed them, his stress and inability to cope - her brave, yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together. i think the characters, acted by anyone else, would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't. it reflects the surreality of the situation they're in, that he's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby. i felt angry at her for that, i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her. i felt it all.<br /><br />in the end, i loved it and would recommend it.<br /><br />watch out for the scene where dermot mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session - career performance.
