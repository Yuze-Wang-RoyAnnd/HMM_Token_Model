this movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing american patriot actor -- one that believes his work (and politics) are as crucial to the american people as the opinions of the president himself. alan bates captures this mindset perfectly as michael baytes, and i will immortally remember bates as this character. this is a movie for canadians and americans alike. it is a valuable piece of cinema, that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and innumerable outside forces. wonderfully, "hollywood north" does not suffer from the subject that it portrays: peter o'brian directs with precision and complete control, and commands both the serious 'behind-the-scenes' portion of the movie, and the movie-within-the-movie, "flight to bogota" with clarity and insight. if you are at all interested in the wit and strength of canadian cinema, "hollywood north" is a great place to start.
