this movie is horrible, but you have to see it because of that. i'm not here to discuss the entire film, just the greatest chase scene ever. when eddie dumbs milk on tim, he gets chased down the hallway. eddie puts obstacles in the jocks way with hilarious consequences (like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player; buy the dvd and watch it slow). the best obstacle is a knocked over mop bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door. but when he slides he picks up speed thus defying physics (mainly friction); yet what lies behind the door is supreme. the steepest stair case in any school ever, which this jock proceeds to clear in the air. in reality he probably would die of a broken neck. not only does he defy all concepts of reality, he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation. go and buy this one. trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks.
