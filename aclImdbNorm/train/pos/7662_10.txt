as b movies go, it was well above average (i warn the reader now that i may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie, although i am trying to minimise any such tendency). as sequels usually go, it was utterly fantastic(despite a "cookie cutter" approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum. despite this sometimes tedious tendency, it seemed to work in this particular film, so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original "scanners").<br /><br />the movie was similar in ways to the "superman" series, in terms of the main character's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents (who seemed modelled along the same lines as the kents in the "superman" stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. the depiction of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-conforming children, adolescents and/or adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as "real genius", and (to a more superficial degree) "doctor mordrid" and struck a particularly strong chord.<br /><br />the film had a positive message, and was fun to watch. i found some of the insights and accuracy (in terms of depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating, and even profoundly touching at times. these moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula-driven schlock and gratuitous sex(uality, in this case, as the sexual elements were tastefully done) and violence that makes b movies (or shakespearian plays, for that matter!) so much fun to watch!<br /><br />this is a must watch for all comic book, sci-fi, "remote viewing" enthusiasts, and horror fans! with the right exposure in the right circles, the film could develop quite a cult following, along with the original "scanners".
