quite simply the best reality show ever made. the first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on hulu. i challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and not like it. i guarantee you will finish watching the season. then i guarantee that you will watch season 2. <br /><br />other quick reasons to watch it: 1. anderson cooper is hilarious 2. the locations in europe are awesome 3. the games are mentally challenging 4. it's very interactive 5. in one episode a player responds to another player's desperate, "i'm trying as hard as i can!" with an equally desperate, "not necessarily." <br /><br />can you figure out...who is the mole?
