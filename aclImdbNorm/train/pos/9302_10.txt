most of the comments have been positive but i would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets. the set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so forth. it is worth paying attention to. the movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich. all the gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat. the dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and i suppose it was meant to be that way. this is a film buff's film. it was made by people, for people who love the medium. don't miss this one.
