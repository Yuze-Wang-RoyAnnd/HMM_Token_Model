war inc. is a funny but strange film. the actors are likable, the film is likable also, but i don't know how to describe the plot. i will go into the plot later on. this is a movie with some weird casting choices. besides john cusack as a hit-man, which we saw years ago in grosse point blank which i liked. <br /><br />here we have hilary duff playing a russian pop star named yonica babyya or something like that. her character is odd. there is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants. and hits on hauser(cusack). there is a twist in the end involving the two characters. it makes sense.<br /><br />that is the only casting choice i am going into. cause it just plain strange. the whole movie is strange. but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored. here we have some of the best actors out there. excluding miss duff. she ain't great. but here we have john cusack, marisa tomeii, joan cusack, ben kingsley. see what i mean?<br /><br />this is the story of a hit-man named hauser(cusack). he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar sheriif(not the actor). while trying to deal with his own personal problems, he has to help out the wedding of a popstar(played by hilary duff). and he falls in love with a news reporter(played by marisa tomeii). there is a thing about the popstar though. hauser is disgusted by her. there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up.<br /><br />the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why. the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming. but that doesn't matter. this is a strange, funny, and entertaining comedy. i love most of the actors. so really, how could i not recommend it?<br /><br />war,inc.:3.5/5
