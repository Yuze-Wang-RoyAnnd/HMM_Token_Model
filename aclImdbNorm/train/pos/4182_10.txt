i saw this australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. the movie shows the horror of war in a way that hollywood usually glosses over. the relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside. if you can find any type of copy of this--buy or rent it. you won't be disappointed, just awed.
