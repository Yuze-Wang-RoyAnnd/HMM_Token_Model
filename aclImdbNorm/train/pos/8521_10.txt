i absolutely loved this show. i watched it from the time it first aired in the late 90's to the very last episode. in my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children. yes things have changed a bit with jo since we last saw her in the books, but it's still compelling with great stories and good lessons. the actress that portrays jo bhaer (michelle burke) does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays nick riley (spencer rochfort) throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between jo and nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn. i recommend this show to anyone.
