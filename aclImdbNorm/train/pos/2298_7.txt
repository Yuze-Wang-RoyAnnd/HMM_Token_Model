i love occult horror, and the great british hammer studios, who delivered one of their greatest films with "the devil rides out" (1968), have proved to be more than capable in this field of horror. this occult tenth episode of hammer's short running tv-series "hammer house of horror" (1980), "guardian of the abyss", is indeed a creepy entry to the series. director don sharp, who had previously enriched the hammer oeuvre with "the kiss of the vampire" (1963) and "rasputin: the mad monk" (1966) and furthermore directed two "fu machu" movies starring christopher lee, is doubtlessly one of the better-known names among the hhh directors, and he also delivers here. antiques dealer michael (ray lonnen) stumbles over a mysterious old scrying glass. the scrying glass happens to be the object of desire of a devil-worshiping cult, who want to use it for their satanic rites. when he shelters a beautiful young girl named allison (rosalyn landor), who is to be sacrificed by the cult, michael gets into deeper trouble with the cult and their sinister leader (john carson)... while this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of "hammer house of horror" (the best one clearly is the brilliant seventh episode, "the silent scream"), it is a very creepy and atmospheric one. the plot has several interesting twists, and stays suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film. ray lonnen makes a good lead, young rosalyin landor is convincing as the innocent beauty, and john carson is truly creepy as the leader of the satanists. overall, "guardian of the abyss" is another interesting and creepy hhh tale, and my fellow hammer fans should not miss it.
