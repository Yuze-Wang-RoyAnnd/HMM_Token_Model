when i think of return of the jedi i think epic. yeah ewoks were in there so what? they're an interesting add to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies. emperor palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid) was one the best parts of the movie. palpatine is so evil and vicious, vader looks like mr. rogers compared to him . speaking of darth vader, what an amazing end to such an iconic character. vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out. his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you. the best part was of course the special effects. it's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics. the scenes at jabba's palace (leia looks amazing in that metal bikini) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at. in all jedi's deep plot and emotional moments (primarily between luke vader and palpatine and when luke reveals the truth to leia) and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.
