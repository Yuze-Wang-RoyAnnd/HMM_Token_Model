this is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (gershwin) and a nice 'parisien' atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm, but in terms of a story.. well it's not really there. or at least, not very well worked out. the acting is also not so smooth by caron. but i liked some of the dialogues, i liked the scene at the seine, i liked the character played by levant, the colors; and the dancing of course, which is quite magnificent.<br /><br />a 7.5 - 8 seems on the dot to me.
