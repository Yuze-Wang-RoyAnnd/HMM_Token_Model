"written on the wind" is a douglas sirk's melodrama. douglas sirk was rediscovered by the "cahiers du cinema", fassbinder etc.. that hailed him as a master director - i think that it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography - "written on the wind" offers luscious color images and gorgeous decors. but i ask myself: is this enough to carry a film? the acting in "written on the wind" ranges from weak to fair (excepting robert stack - he is convincing as the weak & spoiled playboy). lauren bacall, normally a powerful presence in the screen, is miscast in this film. dorothy malone as the seductress, the care-free "femme fatale" is ok, but she lacks the strength for the role. rock hudson is efficient but vapid .<br /><br />the plot has very interesting ingredients. the main characters are: <br /><br />a rigid patriarch <br /><br />his alcoholic son kyle (robert stack) (never loved by the disappointed father) <br /><br />his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter marylee (dorothy malone)<br /><br />lucy (lauren bacall) - a woman of principles, formerly a secretary and now married to kyle <br /><br />mitch (rock hudson) - brought up together with kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /><br />secrets beyond the door, a love triangle, frustration, fistfights, laughter, death etc. - well, when i read the story summary on the back cover of the dvd i thought that i was in for a treat. my mistake! why? i'll try to explain: "written on the wind" takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. as i said before the acting, in general, is not good enough - the intensity is lacking. there are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors just do an efficient job. i think that maybe with italian or spanish actors those scenes would have been explored fully - they would end (for us) in an explosion of laughter or tears .<br /><br />what remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of douglas sirk. for me this is not enough. if you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "aventurera".
