i've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt it.<br /><br />the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielberg's expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg, oprah winfrey, danny glover, and margaret avery. akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettie.<br /><br />you'll experience every human emotion while watching this film. i laughed, cried, and got angry. like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins. but this movie, without a doubt, is definitely one of the best films of all time.
