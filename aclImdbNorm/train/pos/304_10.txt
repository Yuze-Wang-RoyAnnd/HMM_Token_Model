i watched it some years ago. i remembered it as very mysterious situations, and a mixture of melancholic things, like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovich.<br /><br />i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more. nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version, at any price, please!<br /><br />the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second, a bit of blueish, but also happy.<br /><br />all the characters are great to me, with funny situations, great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs. this may not be casualty.<br /><br />i think that the title is a hope about life! you have to be happy and laugh as much as possible<br /><br />i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie, but the fact is that i like it very much, i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it.
