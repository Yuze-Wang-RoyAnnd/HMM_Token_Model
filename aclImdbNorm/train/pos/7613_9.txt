/the first episode i saw of lost made me think, i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster. but it's not like that, it's far more than that,because their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost , well it's getting better every time. a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed. that's the real secret.<br /><br />this series rules and i can't wait to know what's really going on there i hope that they don't air the last 2 episodes in the theaters,this series deserves a 9 out of 10
