sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty. and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of. if not his best, it's my most loved of all bogdanovich movies.<br /><br />this unique masterpiece remind us, as most of the other films from the director, what life is (or should be) about: love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity. as the song from whom the films takes its title (gershwin's well known composition) the film makes the impossible true, and tries to make us aware that no-one is able to judge anybody; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction (the first ten minutes, with the detectives following the ladies, almost without a line of dialogue, constructed upon the looks and views of the characters --with that "bogdanovich touch" based on the point-of-view-- is a class on cinema language, something that p.b. learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies). with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack (including the best of sinatra's "trilogy"), this movie, full of self-consciousness and compassion, and far away from self-indulgence and emptiness (as some critics wrote), deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed. it's not "long on style, short on substance": it is complex in its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
