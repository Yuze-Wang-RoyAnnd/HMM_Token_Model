answer: despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman, your ex is creepier, nastier, and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth.<br /><br />the acting in this independent film actually is quite good, despite the less-than-wonderful script. it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten, clich'ed line and make it sound vaguely believable. young anthony de marco, as jake, puts in a particularly good performance.<br /><br />fortunately, the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog. try it, especially if you're not a monster fan. this is not a horror flick. even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous, and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film, "jake's closet" is suitable for mature adults.<br /><br />the whole, this time, is much better than the sum of its parts.
