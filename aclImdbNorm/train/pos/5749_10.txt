i want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality to this comment. also, this comment will be much more meaningful to you after you have seen the movie.<br /><br />although it is tragically sad to say, that movie bears a resemblance to my life that is so striking that it is truly scary. the rest of you will never know how accurately that movie depicts how persons who have been in situations like that act and react in their later lives.<br /><br />this could not have been a work of fiction; it had to be based on personal experience.<br /><br />my testament to the how good the movie was is shown by the fact that, although it was one of the best movies i've ever seen, watching my life portrayed on the silver screen was such a searingly painful experience that i will never be able to see it again.<br /><br />but i endorse it heartily to all others as a chance to peer into the soul of another human being to the extent that you probably never experienced before or will ever again. i know that for a fact, because that's my soul you will be observing.
