lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's early bean performances, and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work, something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages, in a way that just makes you feel good. a bug's life has that same charm, it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects, because even though they talk, they still act just like real bugs. it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them, to imagine bugs the way a young mind does.<br /><br />honey, i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger, and to me, a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie, if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities. i try not to compare it to something like toy story (which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made), because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's, but then again, almost nothing is. the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun. <br /><br />the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society, mostly geared around building a harvest of food, most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers, vastly superior in strength and general meanness, and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter. we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers, who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food, the consequences will be dire. and incidentally, the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tse-tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the "great leap forward
