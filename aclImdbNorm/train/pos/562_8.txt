this is mostly a story about the growing relationship between jeff webster(jimmy stewart) and ronda castle(ruth roman). she takes an instant liking to jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to skagway, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder. they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction. neither trusts a member of the opposite sex, apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them. gradually, they learn to trust each other, as they journey from skagway to dawson. but ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff gannon and engages in some shady practices in her castle saloon in skagway. she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff. meanwhile, rene, a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff, but only gets insulting brush offs in return. yet, she sticks with him in his travels from skagway to dawson and his activities around dawson. along with ronda, she nurses him back to health after jeff is left for dead by gannon's gunslingers at his gold claim. walter brennan, as ben, serves as jeff's long time sidekick. he doesn't have a meaty role, but serves to soften jeff's hard edges. his demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for jeff.<br /><br />john mcintire(as sheriff gannon) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying. evidently, he sees something of himself in jeff, repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him. he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith, who spent his last years in skagway, as one of the premier con men of his times.<br /><br />jeff is the quintessential antihero, a loner(except for companion ben), who doesn't want to stick his neck out for others, even when he knows he is the one right man for the job. in this respect, he closely resemble's burt lancaster's character in "vera cruz", for example. thus, jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of dawson, he is convinced to leave dawson after gannon's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims, while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from dawson. even ronda suggests that she and jeff make a hurried exit from dawson while they are still alive. then, jeff has a sudden change of heart, apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of ben and himself. he changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of gannon's gang from dawson. in this respect, he differs from lancaster's character, who never reforms(but is jeff truly changed, or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?)<br /><br />the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women. clearly, ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame jeff. although she is clearly characterized as a "bad" girl, jeff has a checkered recent past himself, having shot at least 5 men in the us or yukon, and having stolen his cattle back from gannon. ironically, soon after jeff changes from anti-hero to hero, rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of gannon's impending ambush. she dies as a result and jeff asks her why she didn't just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!).<br /><br />it's clear that corine calvert, as renee, just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead ronda, in jeff's mind. yet, the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together, even though jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug. her image as a good, if naive, young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in rhonda's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust, pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later. i'm also very unclear about her relationship with rube morris, a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her.(he's not her father).<br /><br />another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and gannon's gang. if gannon had any skill at all with a pistol, he should have killed or seriously wounded jeff under that boardwalk, before jeff did the same to him. and how did jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? i also wonder what jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims. they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow. and why weren't most of ronda's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche?<br /><br />you will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannon's gang. the sequences shot in the canadian rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action. all-in-all, a very entertaining western, with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end. no doubt, this film takes some great liberties with history and geography, especially, the part taking place in the canadian yukon, which was in fact much tamer than the us skagway.
