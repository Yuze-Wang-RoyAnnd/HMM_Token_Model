if you would like to see a film of different kind, if you feel the love in your heart, even if you miss the lord, this film makes you think. although georges is mentally handicapped, you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end, when love gives you directions not the brain. i am not emotional, but this film makes you feel the human being. the film is as good as forrest gump in my belief. the foreign movies are sometimes more interesting, yet there is not enough advertisement to make them popular. "rang-e khoda" (the color of the god) by majid majidi is another example of such foreign movies, almost with similar taste.
