this is a fantastic series first and foremost. it is very well done and very interesting. as a huge wwii buff, i had learned a lot before seeing this series. one of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that is. it is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today, it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. one of the best parts is the narrating by sir laurence oliver. i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about wwii, but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. my only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. especially with the information about soviet union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. that information is now different we now know because of the fall of the ussr. overall a fascinating look at wwii and a must see for any serious wwii historian professional or personal alike.
