a toothsome little potboiler whose 65-minute length doesn't seem a second too short, my name is julia ross harks back to an english tradition of things not being what they seem -- hitchcock's the lady vanishes is one example. out-of-work julia ross (nina foch) finds a dream job at a new employment agency in london, whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend. after reporting to duty, she wakes up (having been drugged) in a vast manderley-like pile on the cornish coast, supposedly as the barmy-in-the-crumpet wife of george macready, who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks. his doting, enabling mum is the irresistible dame may whitty (this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of good-vs-evil than she occupied in the lady vanishes). the nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically; we know what's going on but are powerless to tell poor julia. this movie, curiously, is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest (and very few british) films noirs. i think it's closer to the gothic old-dark-house tradition than the american one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption; it does, however, evince a more modern, psychoanalytic cast of mind. whatever you call it, it remains a sharply satisfying thriller.
