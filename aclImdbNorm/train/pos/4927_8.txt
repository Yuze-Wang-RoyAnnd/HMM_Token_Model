just a comment on new orleans accents...<br /><br />an earlier reviewer noted the following: "this film, could have been shot in new york, or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like "broklynese" than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country." there was also another comment along these lines from an english reviewer.<br /><br />many people in new orleans do, in fact, sound "broklynese". i have never found out why. (it's mentioned in "a confederacy of dunces" by john kennedy toole.) i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail, as this one did. too often it's just the hollywood version of the standard southern accent.
