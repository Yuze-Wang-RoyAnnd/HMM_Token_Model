though the pieces are uneven this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience. there were some who, in the wake of the emotion on the anniversary of the bombings, took this to be anti-american. i don't think thats the case, even though some parts might be taken that way if you don't look behind the obvious. ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion, sympathy and feelings about what happened. these are stories of people who's worlds have been shaken up by what happened on a tuesday in september.<br /><br />as i said this film will move you, probably to tears. its not always easy to watch, for example the film from mexico is little more than a black screen with sound, but its effect is such as to lay even the strongest of people low. if you can be strong you really should see this film. it will comfort you and enlighten you and affect you...
