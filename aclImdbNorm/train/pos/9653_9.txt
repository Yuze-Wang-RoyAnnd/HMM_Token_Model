first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous.<br /><br />lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving, sexy, thoroughly engrossing tale of love, disaster and possible redemption, while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence.<br /><br />the core story is of mathieu, 18, a solitary, introverted boy who meets c'edric, brasher, more outgoing but just as lonely, while on holiday with his family. as the summer warms on, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, decide to live together. a year later, the relationship ends in catastrophe: c'edric cheats on mathieu who, distraught, tries to take his own life. he survives and, in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met, this time cloaked in the chill of winter.<br /><br />if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does: much of it is implied, all of it happens non-sequentially.<br /><br />the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced, through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. fortunately, the three time-lines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are colour coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside.<br /><br />both main actors put in excellent performances though, whilst it's a delight to see st'ephane rideau (c'edric) used to his full capacity (i'm more used to seeing him under-stretched in gael morel's rather limp dramas), j'er'emie elkaim (mathieu) has to be singled out for special mention: you can feel his loneliness, then his almost incredulous passion, then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia. beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.<br /><br />the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning
