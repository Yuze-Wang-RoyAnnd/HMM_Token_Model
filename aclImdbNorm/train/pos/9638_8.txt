this movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man, and how he must deal with everyone. his mother is depressed, his younger sister is a pain, his older sister is somewhat accepting. the relationship looks good with his boyfriend/exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. unfortunately, the new guy screws around on him and says it really didn't mean anything. our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves, dumping his new lover and starting over. we are left with him starting over and viewing, not participating, in happiness. so maybe things will go better for him in the future. the ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so i will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating.
