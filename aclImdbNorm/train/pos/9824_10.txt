this flick is sterling example of the state of erotic b-movies: bad porn movies without the hardcore sex. the plot in this one isn't so bad as these things go; it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife. the rest of the movie, however, leaves something to be desired. bad acting, bad direction, bad looking woman, bad sets, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad sex scenes. the filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic. they don't even have the common sense to have gabriella hall naked or in a love scene.<br /><br /> how dumb is that?
