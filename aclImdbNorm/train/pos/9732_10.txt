how to lose friends and alienate people came out in 2008. it bombed at u.s. box offices. it's an absolutely hilarious film with a great cast. simon pegg is great playing sidney young, who wrote the book "how to lose friends and alienate people. i know it's not a true story. the only way i know that is because sidney wants to go out with an actress named sophie maes. sophie maes doesn't exist, but other than that, the film could be real. how to lose friends and alienate people is probably the funniest film of 2008, and i think you definitely should see it. as i said earlier, the film has a fantastic cast including: kirsten dunst(spider-man, the virgin suicides) danny huston(the number 23, 30 days of night) gillian anderson(the x-files) megan fox(transformers, confessions of a teenage drama queen) jeff bridges(the big lebowski, the vanishing) overall, how to lose friends and alienate people is hilarious. i think simon pegg and kirsten dunst do work well together, and i think you should see it. though there is some odd nudity including trans-sexuals, it's a hilarious and awesome comedy. one of simon pegg's best.<br /><br />the plot:sidney young, a journalist from england, travels down to new york to work at sharp magazines. while there, he meets an actress named sophie maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does.
