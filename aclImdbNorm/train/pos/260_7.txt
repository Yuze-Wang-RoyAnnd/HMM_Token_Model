wow! a danish movie with this kind of content? i mean, the actors, the story, the pictures, the efx - everything was where it should be. <br /><br />and a danish efx house producing those vfx - wow! this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that quality.<br /><br />*spoiler ahead* the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good, but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghost-movie. *end of spoiler*<br /><br />but anyway, this is a danish movie which i as a dane can be proud of.<br /><br />the only "bad" about this, is that it wasn't a danish director, but a swedish...
