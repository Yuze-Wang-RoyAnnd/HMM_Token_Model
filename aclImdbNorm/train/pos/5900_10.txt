i am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film (which i first saw soon after it was first released in the early fifties) has had such a poor reception more recently. in my opinion it has been greatly underrated - but perhaps it appeals more to the european sense of humour than to (for example) the american: maybe we in europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more, since we are closer to some of them in real life! particular mention should be made of the limited but good music - especially the catchy and memorable song "it's a fine, fine night", which was issued separately on an hmv 78rpm record (10 inch plum label, i think!) in the fifties. i would urge anyone interested to give it a try if you get the chance: you may have a pleasant surprise.
