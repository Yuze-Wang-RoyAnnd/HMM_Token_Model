turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. the variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! i enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. i also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. it was a great step up from eaves' other efforts, hellbreeder and sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. they have a great website which is worth checking out. can't wait for bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
