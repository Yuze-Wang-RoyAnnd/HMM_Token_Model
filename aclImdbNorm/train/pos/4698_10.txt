just like wine, "johnny dangerously" gets better and better with every day. this clever, witty, well-acted film could very well stand on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it's truly outstanding. in fact, it's quite obviously the best film of its kind... the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the respective period - although, admittedly, this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and dull pseudocomedies as "jane austen's mafia".
