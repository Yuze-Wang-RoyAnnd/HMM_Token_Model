not on the same level as ring (or ring 2) but still a good japanese horror flick nonetheless. i wish north american horror producers would take a page out of the japanese horror template and put more 'spookiness' and less cheap shocks in their flicks. lots of good examples in this one, scenes where a whited out face is scene staring behind a young actress, photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling, just for a second, and more. worth checking out if you like the genre.
