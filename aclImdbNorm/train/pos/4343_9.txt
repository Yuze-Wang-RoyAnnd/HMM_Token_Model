excellent endearing film with peter falk and paul reiser joining forces as father and dad.<br /><br />dad shows up one evening to state that after over 40 years of marriage, mom (olympia dukakis) has left him.<br /><br />the rest of the film depicts the father and son on a day trip to get dad's thoughts off what has occurred. with them away, the daughters can play detectives.<br /><br />the story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life, what should have been, why mom was complaining about dad as they discuss their philosophies of life.<br /><br />we see an unexpected fishing trip and pool playing which leads to a near brawl. both men seem to break out of their daily lives.<br /><br />the end is a downer as we learn why mom suddenly left. it becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity. it's never too late to change.
