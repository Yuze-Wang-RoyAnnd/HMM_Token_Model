first things first, this movie is achingly beautiful. a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lighter/compositor, the visuals blew me away. every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story, well, it's okay. it's not going to set the world on fire, but if you like your futuristic blade runner-esquire tales (and who doesn't?) then you will be fine.<br /><br />i do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole. i saw it at the cinema in english, but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewhere.<br /><br />definitely worth seeing.
