by 1955, five years after this one was released james stewart and anthony mann had completed another six films together, four of them westerns. their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic. buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known - and that's not counting ray teal or 'anthony' curtis, later to become tony. perhaps ten years later the 'psychological' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw ahab into the mix with cain and abel, to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way, and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned. one to add to the dvd collection.
