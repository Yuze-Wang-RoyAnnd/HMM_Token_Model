picked up the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks, sure did get my moneys worth!. could care-less about the hot babes but the animation just blew me away after a steady diet of simpsons (sorry mr. groening). the best part, facial expressions. recommend multiple viewings with some cool tunes, good friends and a couple of cold ones!
