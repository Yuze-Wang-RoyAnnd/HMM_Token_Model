victor mclaglen's performance is one of the finest in film history.<br /><br />i think we can all feel for "gypo" because we've all struggled with what is right and what isn't and been wrong. this was one of the first art-house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio (rko radio pictures).<br /><br />joseph h. august's cinematography is at its very best here. however, august's stunning portion was mostly overlooked; he didn't receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved.<br /><br />this is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all conveyed with as little words as possible.
