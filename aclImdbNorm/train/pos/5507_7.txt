i wouldn't be surprised if soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre- revolution cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to make it with the younger crowd. still, part one, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, does capture the feel of that place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of cuba. i liked del toro's interpretation of che guevara's personality. and the actor who plays castro, bichir, also did a great job, against all odds. it's clear soderbergh doesn't look down on these people, but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past. some of the more important historical aspects contradict what i've read. to my knowledge castro did not court the soviet union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the united states were exhausted. but on other aspects he is right on, especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went other rebel control. the country's treasury was left empty.
