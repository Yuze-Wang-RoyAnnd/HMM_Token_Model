an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era. i loved the visuals--very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel.<br /><br />i thought tom hanks was really great in this, he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work (which he didn't fully choose for himself) but still wants to have a normal life for his family. he does the best he can to see that happen. don't want to spoil the plot--but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action/gangster format. (it is violent though.)
