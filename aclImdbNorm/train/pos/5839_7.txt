the last (i believe) of the movies the boys made with hal roach, this is also the last truly funny film they made, before going to 20th century fox, which so famously misued their talents. although there are weak moments - the business with the "lung tester", for instance, is a bit, ah ... overblown (but worth having, just to see "dr." jimmy finlayson) - but on the whole this flick is a good summary of what the boys brought to the screen. richard cramer (uncredited) appeared in other l&h flicks, and he is delightfully threatening here as the convict nick granger. the scene where the boys have to eat their own synthetic meal ("looks good, smells good, and it probably tastes good. eat it.") is one of my favorite moments in the oeuvre. stan & ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans.
