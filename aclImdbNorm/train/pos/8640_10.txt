this movie is great! brad pitt will never be able to out act the performance he gave in this movie. duchovny was top notch, as was forbes and lewis. the 4 main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic murder sites, in one of the coolest cars ever made, 1960's model lincoln continental. early grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. he likes his women to not curse or smoke, and wear pwt dresses. duchovny and forbes are a pair of artists from the city, while early and lewis are trailer parkers from the rural outskirts. even though the majority tone in the film is dark, there are plenty of funny scenes to be had. the writing, directing, and acting are brilliant. if you like road movies, murder, humor, and narration, watch this film. everyone delivers, and you will want more when the credits roll. one of my all time favorites. "hey...shave that dog n teach it to hunt!"
