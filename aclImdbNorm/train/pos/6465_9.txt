this film, recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 palm springs international film festival, is inspiring and moving. a famous conductor, forced to retire by illness, returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir, and finally find fulfillment in his music. drawing on sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small swedish village, this film develops each of its characters well. superbly directed, acted and sung, it brought tears to many eyes, and smiles to all. hopefully it will find distribution in the united states.<br /><br />if you can, see it!
