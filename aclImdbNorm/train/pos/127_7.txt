zentropa has much in common with the third man, another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar europe. like ttm, there is much inventive camera work. there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand, and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives.<br /><br />but i'd have to say that the third man has a more well-crafted storyline. zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect. perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare, and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. <br /><br />this movie is unrelentingly grim--"noir" in more than one sense; one never sees the sun shine. grim, but intriguing, and frightening.
