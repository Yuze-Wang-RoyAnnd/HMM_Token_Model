okay, i'll admit it--i am a goof-ball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy. while i have seen more films by kurosawa, bergman and truffaut than practically anyone on the planet, i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesn't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny. a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail, uhf, start the revolution without me, strange brew and the bill and ted movies. they all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them.<br /><br />while bill & ted's bogus journey isn't as wonderful as the original bill and ted film, it still is great fun. also, unlike the original, it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing. i remember not loving the film the first time i saw it--possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs. but, every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great moments--particularly those involving the grim reaper. and, by the way, this reaper is about as different from bergman's in the seventh seal as you can get!! in addition to a lot of laughs, this film features some excellent music--one way that it's actually better than the first film. the kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes--provided you aren't an old killjoy like de nomolos. great viewing for kids and adults alike.
