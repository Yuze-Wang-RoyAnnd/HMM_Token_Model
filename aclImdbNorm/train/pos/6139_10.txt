a great movie. lansbury and tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a particular mention for the "portobello ballet" are gorgeous. as for the animated section, the match between animals has become an instant classic; the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating. i recommend to see the restored 134 minutes version or at least the 112 minutes video. here in italy we have only the 98 minutes version, although the film was presented in its original release at the running of 117 minutes. if possible, watch also the german videocassette: it was generated from the 98 minutes running but it's missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scenes between english people and their nazi invaders!
