this movie is humorous, charming, and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons so i simply accept it as is. bing, in his usual inimitable style, performs quite well as the blacksmith, hank martin, who by accident is transported back to another age, the time of king arthur. the beautiful rhonda fleming is breathtaking as alisande, or sandy, the object of hank's affections although she is betrothed to the brave and formidable sir lancelot, played by henry wilcoxon.<br /><br />i just love that episode when king arthur (cedric hardwicke), sir sagramore (wm. bendix), and hank (bing crosby) dress up in tattered clothing and take to the high road with their knapsacks to experience the kingdom at firsthand. king arthur's comment, "i say, we are not alone" while giving his scruffy garments a good scratch, is one of those hilarious moments in the film. william bendix's portrayal is superbly ridiculous, not to mention his attempts at quaint "ye olde english." <br /><br />the story is not deep but it's well done in my opinion and i enjoy it more each time i see it. it's great family entertainment too.<br /><br />
