the national gallery of art showed the long-thought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10, 2005. it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release. the character of the cobbler, a moral goody-goody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top. also, the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form. a wonderful film of seduction and power. hopefully, there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities. look for it.
