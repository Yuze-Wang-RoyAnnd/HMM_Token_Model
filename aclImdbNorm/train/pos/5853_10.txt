i really liked this summerslam due to the look of the arena, the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason. anyways, this could have been one of the best summerslam's ever if the wwf didn't have lex luger in the main event against yokozuna, now for it's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but i'm glad times have changed. it was a terrible main event just like every match luger is in is terrible. other matches on the card were razor ramon vs ted dibiase, steiner brothers vs heavenly bodies, shawn michaels vs curt hening, this was the event where shawn named his big monster of a body guard diesel, irs vs 1-2-3 kid, bret hart first takes on doink then takes on jerry lawler and stuff with the harts and lawler was always very interesting, then ludvig borga destroyed marty jannetty, undertaker took on giant gonzalez in another terrible match, the smoking gunns and tatanka took on bam bam bigelow and the headshrinkers, and yokozuna defended the world title against lex luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending. however it deserves 8/10
