this film is an absolute classic for camp. that is why it was an elvira and mst3000 classic. everyone knows the story. scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks. finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scar-faced chick's head on top. the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant's remaining "good" arm (his other is not right from a scientist's earlier failure), and the whole place burns down.<br /><br />the movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldn't go into his basement for a year after seeing it. as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four. only one of those scary movies was really any good (the original "the haunting".)<br /><br />i had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers. its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies (complete with porno sound track) scares the hell out of innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing. i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while i'd rather go to the dentist than watch "chicago" again.<br /><br />seven is the most i can give it, because its entertainment value is mere luck. the film , as cinema, is a disaster.
