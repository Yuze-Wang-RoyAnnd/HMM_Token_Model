i first saw ice age in the subiaco cinemas when it came out, back in '02. i was only 13 at the time, but even then i liked it. it had some sort of warmth.<br /><br />we've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3d animations made at the time - the characters have no particular 'home' which they leave. they are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch.<br /><br />also, each individual character on the surface, appear to be just putting up with each other, but they're really all good friends. as well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. all the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic edge.<br /><br />another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. there are hardly any female characters, but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.<br /><br />all in all, ice age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before shrek 2 and the incredibles came out.
