in this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot. it is actually nice to watch because singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships. this makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for. in fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap. definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college movie.
