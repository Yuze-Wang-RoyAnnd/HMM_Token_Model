i saw this movie yesterday on turner, and i was unable to stop watching until it was over, even though i sort of could guess what would happen. farrell was great in her role, and everyone else did a super job. some of it seemed to stretch the limits, but all in all, i loved it!! if you get the chance to see it, please do! i actually cried at a few scenes, but then i guess if you are a mom you would. loretta is beautiful, and i was just in astonishment at the very idea of their being unwed moms there, it seemed ahead of its' time. i say, watch it if you can, and don't listen to criticisms. as they say, i laughed, i cried! i thoroughly enjoyed it!
