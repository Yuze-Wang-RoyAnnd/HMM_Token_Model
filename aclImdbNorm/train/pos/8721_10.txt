disney (and the wonderful folks at pixar of course) offer a nice, humourous story combined with the best of computer animation. i admit that maybe the 'faces' of the bugs were a little more static than in 'antz' and they only had four legs (in 'antz' six...). but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking. but let this be a lesson: it was not the computer who made it such a success : it was the man behind the machine, who added the nice little twists, which i missed in 'antz'. some highlights were of course the 'bloopers' at the end (so keep watching at the end, it's worth it!), which were highly amusing and original. the line 'filmed entirely on location' was intended for the more attentive viewer.
