i'm so glad i happened to see this video at the store. i was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem. i loved that the movie, a love story of sorts, wasn't about some beautiful twenty-somethings; rather, it's a story of some beautiful sixty-somethings, who used used to be twenty-somethings. it's a good, well written, and wonderfully acted story with fabulous wwii band music thrown in as well. it's also got a delightful surprise in it for scottish castle lovers. it left me smiling and ready to watch it again, which i did a couple more times before i turned it in. i highly recommend it.
