i was lucky enough to see zero day last night. it's an amazing movie. a very disturbing one at that.<br /><br />in a way, zero day is very comparable to "the blair witch project". it's shot completley with handheld camcorders. it's about 2 kids. just your average kids. andre and calvin. they start a campaign against there high school entitled "army of 2".<br /><br />the whole story is told in video diary form, from the 2 kids. it shows there relationships with there parents, amongst other people, showing that these are just normal kids, just like people we know or who have bumped into. we find out the army of 2's last mission will be entitles zero day. they plan to shoot up there high school.<br /><br />you see how they get access to there guns, how they plan it out, everything. they stress that the media has not affected them at all, and there is no reason for doing this. like i said, this is all told in video diary form, and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after zero day.<br /><br />the actual shooting is shown through survillence cameras throughout the school. chilling indeed. the movie is very chilling. some of the things they say, how they plan it out, you'd just have to see it for yourself. one quote that i remember is the only time calvin is byhimself. he says "andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway car, doing this to numerous schools across the country. i don't know what he's thinking, but the only way i'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag".<br /><br />i'm probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. you really need to see it yourself. it's going around festivals right now.<br /><br />a+.
