this 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better michael curtiz's film "angels with dirty faces". as directed by ray enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in america's inner cities today.<br /><br />the film is only worth seeing because of the presence of ann sheridan and ronald reagan, who showed they were well paired together. the dead end kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks.<br /><br />in a way it's curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in new york. it was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. in today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. the young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. how times change!
