i could not believe the low 5.6 rating on imdb about johnny dangerously at the moment i wrote this review and i thought i had to do something to promote that memorable piece of comedy as much as i can. seriously, to get a rating so low, the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very shallow opened mind. if you don't like humorous flicks, don't watch them! combining absurd humour, a very good storytelling, and an outstanding pace given by the multiple running gags, this movie has made its way into my dvd collection. and that is without mentioning the visual farces embedded here and there and of course, the use of "clin d'oeils" and "clich'es" based on our favorite organized crime movies. <br /><br />i showed this movie to a lot of people and, being introduced to it without any specific expectations (except maybe watching a comedy)- the very state of mind you should have to watch any movie in my opinion - they all liked it very much. it goes well, it's not long to watch and there are absolutely no slowing downs in the evolution of the story, which i think is really straightforward. sure it's not perfect, some gags fall a bit short, but no movie is perfect, especially when considering other opinions that yours. that is why i rated this movie 9 out of 10. this movie is in my opinion a precursor like "top secret" and "spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well-thought comedies. which are nowadays more and more absurd while cutting down on the thought and ingeniosity side. sometimes gags need more culture than a lot of people imagine to be understood correctly, if at all. as a final word, i would like to say : watch it for yourself, do not follow average joe's saying and if you don't like it, then you'll know for real it was not good for your tastes, which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion.
