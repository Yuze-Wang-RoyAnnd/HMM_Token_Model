gandhi my father is like viewing a book, chapter by chapter you read it(with your eyes) and you learn more about harilal gandhi and for that matter kasturba gandhi. so little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely. the title misleads though, its as much a movie about mohandas karamchand gandhi and his son, as its about harilal and his mother. and akshaye khanna and shefali chayya do full justice to their respective roles.<br /><br />such movies are like leap years. they come after only so much time.<br /><br />gandhi my father, is also about an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever undertaken.<br /><br />watch it, if you like quality cinema.
