wonderland is the fascinating film chronicling the x-rated film star john c. holmes involvement in the brutal wonderland murders.<br /><br />the movie's promotion misleads one into thinking this a romanticized portrayal of the porn industry in the vein of boogie nights and that is not the case here.in fact,except for a few references made by newscasters that john holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of real-life footage of john holmes this film is strictly drama about a fallen celebrity's involvement with murder and how it happened.<br /><br />despite being mislead the film is actually engaging.the acting from all the cast is excellent and i'd like to say that val kilmer is amazing in his ability to get down all the mannerisms of john holmes.i was completely convinced that i was watching what john c. holmes probably looked and acted like in real life.<br /><br />if you are a john c. holmes fan or like stories about hollywood then i think you will enjoy watching wonderland.
