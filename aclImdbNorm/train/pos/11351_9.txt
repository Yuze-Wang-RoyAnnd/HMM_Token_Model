excellent film. the whole picture was filmed in budapest, so i feel proud. my little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the hungarian state railways (m'av), and it is plain to see that they were used in big train, not in the local railway - according to the story chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations. apart from this, the film is superb.
