"the days" is a typical family drama with a little catch - you must relate to the character's emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the show.<br /><br />[possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the show]<br /><br />the story, obviously, for all the people who has watched the show, is the world of cooper day, the middle child of the family. he records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations. his family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister, and a genius-little-brother. the first episode, which is going to sound a bit stupid since john scott shepard has created this situation - both the sister and mother gets pregnant. that's the first situation the writer hits. then the father quits his job at the law firm. the youngest son gets a panic attack. the middle child gets in a fight with the sister's boyfriend. this is all in a day's work.<br /><br />[/spoilers]<br /><br />i admire this show. i don't know. it's a bit crappy but i like it. first i thought the camera-work was a ripoff but then i got used it and started to like it. i liked the quiet conversations under a dark light. i liked the intimate feeling of the show. i liked the low-budget style. i liked the acting. i admire the story. then i find myself wanting a second season of the days. i slowly became a fan of it as the 6-episode airing on abc came to an end. it's a really good show and it's nothing like the oc. the two have nothing in common. so i hope fans will stop comparing them.<br /><br />and if you can relate to either abby, jack, natalie, cooper or even nate, you'll like this show. a lot.
