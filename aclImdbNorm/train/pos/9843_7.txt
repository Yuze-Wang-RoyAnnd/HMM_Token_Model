*may contain spoilers* *may contain spoilers*<br /><br />in the age of shrek(the movie) & pixar(the studio), this is a much more traditional animation film. it put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together(not to mentioned, try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father). they begin as enemies and end as best friend. if this sound like a disney film, it is(only made through 20th century fox). the trailer to the movie was one of the best i've seen in ages, but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set. the problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film. yes, there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children. the parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min. their children's attention is focused on something else than them. the backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film. children will love this film, adults will only like it.
