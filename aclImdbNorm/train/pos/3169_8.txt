i rented this some years ago, the video store had only vhs at the time. straight to video was hitting it's strides (you know, where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films).i didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. first thing i thought while watching was "what the hells' wrong with the sound?"-obviously there was no dialogue dubbing. words echoed, so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attention-mind you there's no shakespeare here!,just simple talk. the story is simple enough, boy meets girl etc.. what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was, the people in the movie didn't seem like caricatures written into the story,but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs(uniforms included). all the while, you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after,then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor(people hurting their privates,using vulgarities this couldn't have hurt the marketing. there was something honest about it. i thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better, which i'm sure they considered daily,but, they went ahead and made it. this, i felt, was what independent film-making is all about.the word "indy", is thrown around as if it's a genre..ha!..that's funny!
