this episode apparently grew out of the cold war. there has been a holocaust but somehow elizabeth montgomery and charles bronson have come through unscathed. it then becomes a battle for turf. she is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over. it's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. they come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. but it still is captivating and interesting. because she doesn't speak, we don't know here mind very well, but in the end we can guess.
