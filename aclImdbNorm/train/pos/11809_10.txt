dick tracy wasn't the best for many comic book fans, because they wanted something with blood like batman. dick tracy plays the innocence of just being a comic book with villains that have severe appearance disorder and being fun. warren beatty directs and stars as the main character that fights crime without even using super powers. i have liked dick tracy since i was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. this is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children. al pacino is like the jack nicholson in batman and plays big boy caprice with zest. madonna as the babe who is the second villain in this film doesn't play the same boy toy she represents. like i said, no blood, obscenities, sexually innuendo or anything to offend anybody.
