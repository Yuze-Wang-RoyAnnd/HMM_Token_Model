in this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic k-9, detective dooley [james belushi] and his dog jerry lee return to fight crime, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [christine tucci] and her partner, a mean doberman named zues who does not get along with jerry lee very well. dooley does not get along with his new partner much either. that all changes as the movie goes along. the movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill dooley for the way he treated him in the past. there is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of dooley's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. i know that that seems like very low humor, but some of it is actually very funny. i didn't see this movie for the jokes, i saw it for two reasons. the first reason is because i am a big james belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. james belushi is funnier than he was in k-9 and the action sequences at are better too. it would have been nice to see more characters from k-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie. if you are a james belushi fan, you'll love this movie.
