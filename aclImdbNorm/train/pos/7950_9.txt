first of all, i loved bruce broughton's music score, very lyrical, and this alone added to the film's charm. the best aspect of the movie were the three animals, superlatively voiced by michael j.fox, sally field and the late don ameche. whereas fox has the funniest lines, ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character(the voice of reason), and field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling chance off. the humans weren't as engaging, and sometimes the film dragged, but that is my only complaint. this is one beautiful-looking film, with beautiful close up shots of canada, i believe. although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously dull moment, and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script. all in all, a charming and perhaps underrated film, with a 9/10 from me. bethany cox.
