this collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea, and presents some great segments, but also some disappointing surprises. based on the tragic event of the september 11th 2001 in the united states of america, eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the american tragedy. the result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy to the american people, but mainly to the intolerance in the world with different cultures and people.<br /><br />ken loach (uk) presents the best segment, about the september 11th 1973 in chile, when the democratic government of salvador alliende was destroyed by the dictator augusto pinochet with the support of the usa.<br /><br />the other excellent segments are the one of youssef chahine (egypt), showing the intolerance in the world, and the number of victims made by usa governments in different countries along the contemporary history; and the one of mira nair (india), showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a pakistanis family, whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in usa, when he was indeed a hero.<br /><br />some segments are beautiful: samira makhmalbaf (iran) shows the innocent afghans refugee children preparing an inoffensive shelter against bombs, while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world; the romantic claude lelouch (france) shows the life of a couple in new york nearby the wtc; danis tanovic (bosnia-herzegovina) shows the effects of their war in a small location and the lonely protest of widows; sean penn is very poetic, showing that life goes on; and shohei imamura's story is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no holy war but sadness and disgrace.<br /><br />the segment of idrissa quedraogo (birkina faso) is very naive, but pictures the terrible poor conditions of this african nation.<br /><br />the segment of amos gital (israel) is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism.<br /><br />the segment of alejandro gonz'alez i~n'arritu is very disappointing, horrible, without any inspiration and certainly the worst one.<br /><br />my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "11 de setembro" ("september 11")
