if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated, you'll enjoy d-war. if you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films, you'll enjoy d-war. otherwise, don't bother! i saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. they really loved it and that made me feel good. after the movie was over, all the kids(my nephews and their friends)could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater.<br /><br />the cg is good. acting and directing are horrible. storyline is extremely simple. but, since the half of the audience was kids, they were screaming, shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen. this made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been.<br /><br />it's a good movie to take your kids to, but except for the final battle sequence, d-war is disappointing. i give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much.
