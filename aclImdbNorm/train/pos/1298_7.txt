a true anomaly in the french cinema ,this despairing work has no equivalent in the contemporary production.one would rather have to look on the side of louis malle's "le feu follet" (1963)(the fire within) to find something not completely unlike harel's effort.wry and cynical,having lost all his illusions,the hero ,a computer scientist,has got no more reason to live.absolutely none.estranged from the human race,he seems to live his life as some kind of entomologist,studying his colleagues.one of them catches his attention:tisserand-jos'e garcia plays the most demeaning part of the decade-.then tisserand will become some kind of prey:all his pessimism will rub off on this poor man.the scene is the night-club climaxes the strange relationship:the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfulfilled unless he.... well now the movie takes a more conventional turn so to speak (clouzot's misanthropy maybe)but just for a while.<br /><br />the form is weird beyond comment there are two voices-over,one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as "our hero",one for the aforementioned hero.the story takes place,now in paris,now in rouen ,guy de maupassant's town.in a scene with his shrink ,the hero says the writer's madness was only the expression of his disgust for man and he draws a parallel between his despair and maupassant's one.<br /><br />this depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience.not for the very short excerpts of x-rated movies,but because after watching it,you may be feeling down in the dumps.
