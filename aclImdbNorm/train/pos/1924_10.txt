this show was great, it wasn't just for kids which i thought at first, it is for the whole family.<br /><br />the first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son, he sadly passed away in season 2, i could believe it when i heard it.<br /><br />i am clad they carried on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and i need to mention the goodbye episode it was so well made, it must of be so hard for them to film this , you could tell they were real tears in theirs eyes. i am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was 13 years too just like roy.<br /><br />season 2 and season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my favorites such freaky friday, secrets.<br /><br />i still think the show was strong enough to go on, i was disappointed that it ended, it was one the best no it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and it could have been the next friends.<br /><br />it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday.
