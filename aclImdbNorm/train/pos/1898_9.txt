the father of the who's alcoholic drummer, keith moon, was named arthur. i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie. liza minelli, who usually overacts, did quite a good job in this one, and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn. yes, i agree, sir john stole absolutely every scene. it was a very "different" movie, enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life. we often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite. god rest dudley moore; this was such an enjoyable movie. much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby/affluent. the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing.
