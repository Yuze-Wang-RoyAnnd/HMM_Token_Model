to me movies and acting is all about telling a story. the story of david and bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan hayward were at their best. to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel, made this story all the more compelling. you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman, gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life. susan hayward's fear, reluctance, but then obedience to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her. one could also feel david's anguish the nigh that uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home. as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle. raymond massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger. the sets were real enough, and the atmosphere believable. all in all i think this was one of the best movies of it's kind. i gave it a rating of ten.
