child 'sexploitation' is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and i feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience. after having seen both 'trade' and 'holly', one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws. the other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide. <br /><br />i do not believe that turning this issue into a hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and i must commend the makes of 'holly' for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure. 'trade' wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts. i found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause. if i had wanted a cheap laugh i would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking. <br /><br />for anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something i would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of 'holly'.
