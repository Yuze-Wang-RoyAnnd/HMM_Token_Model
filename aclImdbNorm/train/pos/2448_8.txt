yes, it's over the top, yes it's a bit clich'ed and yes, constance marie is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again! the jokes and gags might get old and repetitive after a while but the show's still fun to watch. since it's a family show the humour is toned down and the writers have incorporated family values and ideals in between the gags.<br /><br />george lopez is funny. don't take him seriously and the show's a winner. i'm sure he didn't intend his character to be serious or a paragon of virtue. his outbursts and shouts of glee are hilarious...<br /><br />i do have to say that the one big, dark, bitter spot is benny. i hate the character...so much so that anytime she's on for more than 30 seconds i mute the tv just so i don't have to hear her. there is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes. as a mother she has to be the worst out there and i am just shocked and surprised that george, as the character, would stand by such a deplorable person for so long.<br /><br />even so anytime i get ticked off at seeing benny i think to myself: seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the bill engvall show. now there's a bad sitcom...
