we, as a family, were so delighted with 'the last of the blonde bombshells' we purchased a copy for our home video library.<br /><br />the acting is a1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers. the theme is unusual and the script well written. the music/songs are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices. to outline the story here would spoil the 'plot' as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds.<br /><br />full marks to this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a belly-laugh and lots of music.
