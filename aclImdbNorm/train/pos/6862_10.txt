when people ask me why do i like movies so much, i usually respond, "have you seen the art-gallery sequence in de palma's dressed to kill?" that scene alone, pretty much represents everything i want to see in a film. if i was a film director, that would be the kind of thing i'd like to do. "pure cinema" is one way of describing that sequence, and it is truly amazing to see how director de palma's entire movie works at the same high artistic frequency of that scene. it is a dream-like movie, clever as hell, and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films put together. i think the movie raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion: could a movie rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success? the film has no message to speak of, acting is great but it is at the service of the style, and the script is short on logic. de palma's movie makes a really good case that style, when handled properly, can sustain a feature length film. sure, michael caine, angie dickinson, nancy allen and keith gordon give superlative performances, but this is a director's movie all the way to the fadeout. it is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. i won't tell you what hitchcock movie the film pays homage to (i don't want to spoil any surprises), but i think de palma transcends the story's arc, and he manages to create a film that pretty much summarizes his entire career. not for the faint of heart!
