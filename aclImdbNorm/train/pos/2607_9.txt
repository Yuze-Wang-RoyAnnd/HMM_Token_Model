the season finale sent mix messages, i felt feelings of joy, and also feelings of being lied to and deceived. roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband, dan, had died. she also admits the family never won the lottery, and what season 9 was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be. i'm still confused about when she said becky ended up with david, and darlene with mark because becky and mark admit to being pregnant. so i believe that is just how she wanted it to be, but it wasn't. so the season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. i will always be a fan of the show. :)
