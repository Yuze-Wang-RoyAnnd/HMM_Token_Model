until i saw this special on hbo, i had never heard of eddie izzard. i sure am glad that i have now! he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen! rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie. i could not stop laughing for the entire show. if you like to laugh you have to see this special!
