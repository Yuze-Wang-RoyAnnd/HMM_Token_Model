there is no doubt that halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside.i love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about.also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do.this is a movie that i enjoy watching highly, especially around halloween time.john carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films, but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film halloween.oh and if your thinking about watching the rob zombie remake don't.it is pure crap and a true halloween fan would like the 1978 john carpenter version better.michael myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film, and is a very well known one.so by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it.
