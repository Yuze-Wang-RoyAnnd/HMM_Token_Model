this is an awesome action film with great one liners from arnie!. it's stylishly made, with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied. the characters were awesome, and richard dawson, is very menacing as the main villain. yes it has tons of plot holes,however it's highly highly entertaining, with a great ending as well. it had a great story, too it, and arnie and maria conchita alonso had great chemistry together. the character development was also pretty good, with, some superb performances. the directing is great!. paul michael glaser, does a very good job here, with awesome use of colors, keeping it stylish throughout, awesome camera angles, and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job. there is a little bit of gore. we get a few bloody gunshot wounds, exploding head, slit throat, bloody chainsaw slices, skinless corpses, blood, and an impaling. the acting is great!. arnold schwarzenegger is amazing as always, he is excellent in the acting department , has tons of hilarious one liners, kicks that ass, and as always is a big physical presence!, and was tons of fun to watch! (arnie rules!). maria conchita alonso, does well here, she was really cute, and had good chemistry with arnie!. yaphet kotto, is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. marvin j. mcintyre, is good as the geeky type guy, he was cool!. richard dawson is awesome as the main villain, and was very very menacing, and he was fun to watch. jesse ventura,jim brown,erland van lidth,gus rethwisch,and professor toru tanaka, all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers. overall a must see! ****1/2 out of 5
