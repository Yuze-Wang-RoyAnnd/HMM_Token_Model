in this installment of the series, edmund blackadder is stuck in the regency period in britain (during the later portion of george iii's rule). this time, blackadder's prospects are much poorer--as instead of royalty, he's a servant to the very, very thick george iv (the price regent). unlike the historical accounts of george iv, this one is about as bright as a tomato and as a result, blackadder's able to take advantage of him and scheme to his heart's content. the only major difference in style between this one and earlier ones is that the series ends on a very, very, very different note--you just have to see it to believe it. other than that, all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious. the only reservation i have (as always) is that this show is not appropriate for the kids due to its crude language and adult situations.
