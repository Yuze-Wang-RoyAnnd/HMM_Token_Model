if you have read the books then forget the characters that tolkien built in your head. the representation of hobbits, dwarves etc have had the 'disney' treatment. the dark riders are excellent, and as i had always imagined from the books.<br /><br />cinematically this is an excellent film, mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year. i only wish he (bakshi) had been given the money to complete his epic.<br /><br />it's worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 lord of the rings !!
