this show is a great history story. it's has everything from slavery,the way they were treated, religion, the ways jews were sent into hiding,the inquisition, the belief in the orisha the african gods, the way women were treated,including the daughters. even down to homosexuality. the way the characters are intertwined and that violante, that character saddens me. she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her.i am so glad they decided to re-release it to t.v. again. although i would love to see the unedited version. xica has become my heroine. i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it. i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century. i look forward to my xica every night. it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too.
