some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds. this is one of those movies. tracing it's roots back to "double indemnity," and "the postman always rings twice" in the 40's - this was a great example of modern film noir in the 90's. nick cage plays the "down on his luck" main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people, town, violence and threat of red rock west. lots of twists and turns, great performances by cage, hopper and walsh, an hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop, and seamless directing make this a real joy. favorite line: when cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get-away car, shakes his head and says: "f***in' story of my life."
