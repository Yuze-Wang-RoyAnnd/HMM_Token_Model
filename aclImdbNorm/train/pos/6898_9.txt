this is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything french and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in fanfan la tulipe. portrayed by the splendid gerard philippe, the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry king louis xv's daughter! problem is, la lollo soon find outs she too is in love with fanfan...<br /><br />propelled by good sword fights, cavalcades, and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments. the direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un-seriously that i could not give those shortcomings a second thought. look out for noel roquevert, a traditional heavy in french films, trying to steal la lollo, making himself a nuisance, and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads la lollo's hand! and what a gem marcel herrand is as the megalomanous and lust-driven king louis xv! that is not all: so many beautiful women in one film makes me wish i were in france and on the set back in 1952! the film may have come out that year but its verve, cheek, superb narration, immaculate photography and the memorable gerard philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch. i would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular! do see it!
