one of the last classics of the french new wave. for direction, cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of early-century cinema; for story, eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life. so many things can be said of this film - observationally brilliant; self indulgently overlong; occasionally hilarious; emotionally draining...etc. etc. in my mind, whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths. every film student, writer, or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts, no music video overstyling, no soap opera-like plot twists, and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie. everything is to be admired: the writing (concise, clever, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone, quite simply, is perfect in their respective roles), and, simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film) make this film unforgettable. this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you.
