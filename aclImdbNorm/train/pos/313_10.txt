i am black american and i loved this soap opera. i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago. the story was a true story about a black slave who's love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid, whimsical way of living.<br /><br />a lot of us could learn a lot from xica. she took what she had, nothing, and saw her possibilities. many would argue that she sold herself out - but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children.<br /><br />it was such an excellent soap opera, that i thought it would be released on dvd, but it's not being released. this soap opera was the best soap opera ever. we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again. it's playing on azteca america right now, which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable. we need it released again to telemundo.
