eddie murphy delirious is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life. you can compare it to any movie, and i garuntee you will decide that delirious is the funniest movie ever! this movie is about 1hr. 45 mins., and throughout that time, there was barely a moment where i wasn't laughing. you will laugh for hours after it is over, replaying the punch lines over and over and over in your head. eddie murphy has given so many funny performances over his career (48 hrs.,trading places,beverly hills cop,raw,coming to america, the nutty professor,shrek,etc.),but this is by far his most hilarious moment. i have seen this movie so many times, and it is funnier every time. it never loses its edge. from this day forward, every great stand up performance will be emulated from delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
