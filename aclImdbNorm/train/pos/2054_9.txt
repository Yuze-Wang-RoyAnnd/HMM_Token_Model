when i first heard about the title, i thought of 'the simpsons', just like so many other reviewers, but when i saw the cast, i was completely stunned, that so many great character-actors would actually be in this! first of all, we have christopher walken (deer hunter, pulp fiction), who plays the title character, mcbain. he is rescued from a vietnam pow-camp by some of his buddies, one of which is santos (chick vennera, yanks), who splits a hundred dollar bill with mcbain (vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently), and tells him that he can re-do the favor to him, if he ever gets into trouble.<br /><br />then, 18 years later, santos and his sister christina (maria conchita alonso, the running man, predator 2) join the rebels in colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator, el presidente (victor argo, taxi driver, king of new york), and when santos fails the mission, christina goes to mcbain for help.<br /><br />mcbain then asks his good ol' vietnam buddies to help him. first there's the token tough black guy, eastland, played by "american ninja"'s steve james, who was also in director james glickenhaus' previous movie, "the exterminator", where the exterminator's real name also was eastland, coincidence? i think not. there is also a lot of other references to the exterminator, among other things, the most notable one being that mcbain himself wears a welders-mask when christina sees him for the first time, when he is working on a welding-job on top of a bridge! <br /><br />the other guys in the vietnam-pack are: the rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team, frank bruce (michael ironside, total recall, starship troopers), and then there's the doc, dalton, (played by jay patterson, who doesn't look like the guy the imdb is linking to, and i haven't seen him in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, there's the cop, gill, who has had enough of his unsatisfying job, he's played by thomas g. waites, who some of us might remember from the warriors and the thing.<br /><br />and in other big roles, we find luis guzm'an (boogie nights, carlito's way), as a small-time drug-dealer who can't get a decent job. also, there is dick boccelli as the drug-dealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the mcbain-gang, almost exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meat-grinder by john eastland in the exterminator-movie! now, i haven't seen glickenhaus' "shakedown/blue jean cop" yet, but i'm almost ready to bet half a hundred-dollar bill that boccelli gets hung up in that movie too! <br /><br />well, back to the plot of this movie.. they go off to colombia and saves the day, yay! but who cares about the plot anyway, the cast is great, and the action-scenes are very well done, and you're never bored while watching this movie! highly recommended to all action-lovers!
