i have seen several comments here about brando using a southern accent, some of which felt it was a mistake. when this movie was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the south. the jim crow laws were still in effect. civil rights was in it's infancy. could this have possibly been a subtle social commentary, a southern man in love with a woman of another race? the same way mash was a subtle criticism of the viet nam war? any thoughts?<br /><br />another comment was made about myoshi umeki appearing "cold". anyone who has been in japan would understand. the japanese people, at least in my experience, did not tend to show emotion in front of strangers. there were strict social rules, especially for men meeting single women. americans in japan were totally foreign to this culture, and the blunt attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies. one trait of the japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many american servicemen took as a sign that their advances were welcomed. also remember that at the time represented in the movie, japan had just been defeated, and the occupying forces were treated with reluctant acceptance. i think myoshi umeki gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been. watching her interaction with the american actors brought back several memories of my own experiences in the country. i was able to meet a pair of lovely young ladies who, after i convinced them i was not the typical american male, taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country.
