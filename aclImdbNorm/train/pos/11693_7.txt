this movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better. the last one, heaven can wait, was great, i suggest you see that one. this one is not so great. the last third of the movie is not so bad and chris rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today. however, i don't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. it plays like some really bad "b" movie where people sound like they are in some bad tv sit-com. the situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie. it all seems real fake and the editing is just bad. i don't know how they could release this movie like that. anyway, the last part isn't to bad, so wait for the video and see it then.
