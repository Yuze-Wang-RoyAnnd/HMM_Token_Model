i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction. the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interesting...the portuguese, the japanese, and the various communities being managed by the king. the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason. the wardrobe is fine. the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production. the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting. it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective.
