welcome to collinwood is one of the most delightful films i have ever seen. a superb ensemble cast, tight editing and wonderful direction. a caper movie that doesn't get bogged down in the standard tricks.<br /><br />not much can be said about this film without spoiling it. the tag line says it all - 5 guys. 1 safe. no brains.<br /><br />william h macy and sam rockwell lead an amazing cast. george clooney should be congratulated for producing this gem.<br /><br />
