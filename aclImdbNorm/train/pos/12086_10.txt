wonderful family drama/comedy starring macclaine and garr that entertains and warms the heart every time i see it. strongly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grannies. lovely period piece capturing 1962. the story encompasses the struggling garr, her two children and aunt zena (macclaine) trying to make ends meet without a man as head of the household. the "family" heads west to take the inheritance of a long forgotten relative that has left garr a run down, ramshackle road side cafe right out of the late 1940's. the tenacious garr, as the sweet but determined mom, gets the whole family into the restoration and opening of the cafe. but wait......aunt zena is an old circus performer with card tricks, magic powders and a jesters sense of humor......she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games.....what happens next is a delightful combination of "miracle at lords" thrown together with the cuban missile crises (with authentic tv news from the real event) and a "ghost" prank that gets totally out of hand. this film entertains, philosophizes, questions religiosity and gives an unnerving glimpse of the frightening scare of october 1962's cuban missile crises. in the end one is left with the wonder of faith, family and rediscovered love. oh, and the music from the era of the early 60's is just great!<br /><br />recommend strongly as a feel good film 10 out 10
