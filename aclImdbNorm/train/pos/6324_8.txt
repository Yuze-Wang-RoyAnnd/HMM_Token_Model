these guys are anything but the usual suspects! they are a total bunch of likeable oddballs who you want to see get away with it,but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that.no one is better than william h macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck.this is probably his best performance since fargo.sam rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection,and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also.luis guzman brought some great comic relief as cosimo,and george clooney stole every scene in his cameo role.the heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />the direction was also spot on by the russo brothers.there was certainly a coen brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers.they have a long way to go to match the coen's but this is an excellent start and i look forward to their next celluloid outing. ......."yo mutha's a whore"!
