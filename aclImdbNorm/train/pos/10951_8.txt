big s isn't playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like, say mencia or chapelle (though i like them both). she states the obvious in subtle, near subliminal remarks. her show won't change the world, nor is it meant to. but, along with the hilarious brian posehn and paget brewster's ex-boyfriend jay johnston of "mr. show" fame, this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction! my side's were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode. look, i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend, jimmy kimmel, she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run- with-it. the best kind of comedy around. spoofing anything and anyone, like "mary poppins" in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense. this one is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and didn't lose it in their most recent lippo-suction treatment or boob job).
