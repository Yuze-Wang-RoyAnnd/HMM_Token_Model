this is quite the gripping, fascinating, tragic story. quite good, and for the most part pretty accurate, considering it is a tv movie rather than a documentary. they did create some fictional characters, and combine several actual people into one character, but otherwise this is a good telling of a very tragic and dark story.<br /><br />the final moments of the movie, depicting the mass suicide/murder, are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by jim jones. this recording was made during the final 44 minutes of the peoples temple's existence. it is available in several places on the internet. this portion of the film is almost spot on in that regard.<br /><br />to sum up, a documentary this is not. however, it does cover most of the base elements to the people's temple story.
