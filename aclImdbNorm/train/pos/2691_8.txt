probably bigas luna's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. the delicious mathilda may, who spent most of tobe hooper's "lifeforce" in the buff, is the object of young biel duran's pre-teen lust. he can't get may's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too. his pursuit of may is the film. as in luna works such as "lulu" and "jamon! jamon!", the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale. the usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast. jos'e luis alcaine's images are gorgeous and nicola piovani's score is sweet and rich. a gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the spanish do so naturally.
