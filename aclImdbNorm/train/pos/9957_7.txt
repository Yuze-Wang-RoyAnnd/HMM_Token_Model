this film is shockingly underrated on imdb. like so many films, this isn't shawshank. but it's a reasonably good, if predictable, dance competition / personal growth film. if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female step dancer, than i think you'll like it.<br /><br />judging from the imdb ratings, my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250, and was "vote bombed" with many 1s, as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob, don't have special effects, or include non-white or non-straight characters.<br /><br />it's an american film, but it's not a us film. set mostly in toronto the cues are subtle, and some audiences may think it's set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroit.<br /><br />i liked the music. i liked the dance (but not convinced it's worth $50,000 ... but what do i know). the characters were easy on the eyes.<br /><br />i do agree the title sucks. i don't remember anyone in the film saying those words, and it should have an "s". (no, it's not a foreign language).<br /><br />there's not a lot to hate about this film (and let's be honest, a vote of 1 means you hated it) so i can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it, and that's sad.
