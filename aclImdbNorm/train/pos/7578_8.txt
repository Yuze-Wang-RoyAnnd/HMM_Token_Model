shintar^o katsu, who played the blind swordsman "zatoichi" in a total of 27 movies, ends the hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he gets to make love to a ghost, mako midori (blind beast).<br /><br />the big stick, used often in the pursuit of justice, is retired forever.<br /><br />katsu was his usual impudent self as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend at usurious amounts to those who could not afford to pay.<br /><br />the usual amazing swordplay and skill of the big guy was present, along with the blood.<br /><br />i'm going to miss him.
