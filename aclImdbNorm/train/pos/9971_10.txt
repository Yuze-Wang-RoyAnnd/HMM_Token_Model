this film was excellent, i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. this one however got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi, and he sure did that a lot :)
