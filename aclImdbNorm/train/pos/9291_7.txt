an interesting look at japan prior to opening to the west. john wayne as america's first consul to japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from perry's gunboat diplomacy. he is not welcome. wayne eventually wins his meeting with the shogun after bring a cholera epidemic, introduced by an american ship, under control. there follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the shogun, including a bottle of old tanglefoot. the meeting with the shogun, the debates among the japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period. altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.
