i saw the big bad swim at the 2006 temecula film festival, and was totally caught off guard by how much i was drawn into it.<br /><br />the film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. a humorous idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives.<br /><br />what surprised me about the film was how real it felt. rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well. i enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very poignant. nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left a very strong feeling, much like attending school or summer camp - where you find fast friends, form strong bonds, and make discoveries about yourself, yet have to depart all too soon.<br /><br />my only complaint was that the character of paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. i suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...<br /><br />aside from this, i found the film very well-rounded and quite enjoyable. see it if you get the opportunity.
