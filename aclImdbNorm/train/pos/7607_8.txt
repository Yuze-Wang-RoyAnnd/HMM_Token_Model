it's not well shot, well written or well acted but it has to be the most addictive show i've seen since twin peaks. every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure. they have even slowed down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like they've just told you everything you wanted to know. however some of the acting is just about awful and some of the duologue is downright brutal. some characters are very two dimensional. the more experienced actors like locke and ecko really stand out over actors who play jack, kate, sayid and so on. the development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to. annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing. however, the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously. all in all its a great show but not perfect.
