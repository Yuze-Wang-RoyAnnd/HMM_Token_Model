a long time ago, i watched this movie from the middle on cable. i then had a crush on mary moronov. i saw her again in eating raoul. i was convinced that she's the hottest woman on screen.<br /><br />i maybe biased about this movie. 9 out of 10.<br /><br />this's the only movie i own on original tape.
