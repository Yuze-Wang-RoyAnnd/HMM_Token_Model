this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties. much more fun than than palazzo volpi, though just as diseased, this movie is a true gem of squalor. one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness . the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz. here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized. the characters' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer, creating a "phenomenon of a phenomenon" effect which makes this movie a piece of art.
