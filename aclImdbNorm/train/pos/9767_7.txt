oh, boy, god bless the 1970's, we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade: the exorcist, jaws, the texas chainsaw massacre, halloween and now, raggedy ann & andy: a musical adventure. this movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world, i mean seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me. my sister had this movie in her vhs collection and i was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money. what the heck? it's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of toy story, pretty much down to a key, only this was a thousand times scarier, disney had alice in wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children.<br /><br />whenever marcella leaves the room, raggedy ann, along with her brother raggedy andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life. on marcella's birthday, a new doll, babette, arrives from paris, france to the united states of america. babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll, but the friendly raggedy ann does everything she can to make babette feel at home. however, the pirate captain contagious kidnaps her. raggedy ann and andy set off to try to rescue her before marcella discovers babette is gone. out in the world outside the nursery, the two meet the camel with the wrinkled knees, a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely. after raggedy ann and andy hitch a ride on the camel, he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking, runs over the edge of a cliff, into a deep pit. in this pit they encounter the greedy, who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. the raggedys and the camel narrowly escape being consumed by the greedy and continue their journey to find babette
