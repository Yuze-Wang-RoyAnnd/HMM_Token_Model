i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well. it was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant. i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time. i find it really annoying when people say that it wasn't historically correct because it is supposed to be a saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary so i think the costumes and settings were just right. a brilliant start and i am going to love what will come next!! i have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show! we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it.
