well , i come from bulgaria where it 's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be "very , very afraid"!!!this guy (devon sawa) has done a great job with this movie!i don't know exactly how old he was but he didn't act like a child (well done)!now about the tornado-it wasn't very realistic but frightens you!if you want to have a nice time in front of the telly - this is the movie!
