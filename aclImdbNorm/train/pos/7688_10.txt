back in 74 eric monte made the classic t.v show good times. jj has always been my favorite and i love watching the reruns on t.v land. jimmie walker always seemed to be the star and not esther rolle. john amos most of the time felt a little jealous of jimmie walker's popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch good times. the show would have been dead if jj would't have been there to save it with his always kool aid attitude. drinking kool aid was like his favorite thing on the show. i was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended. instead of 1974-1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980's when i was just growing up.
