i am not a very good writer, so i'll keep this short. world at war is the best wwii documentary that i've seen. i've seen different wwii documentaries (not only english/north american) and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary that i've seen. i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and why/how hitler got to power, but it does a very good job at covering the war. it seems to be complete and objective/fair to everyone. it does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations. it has a lot of original footage, including color footage and many eye witnesses (it was made in 70's when a lot more were alive). it has great music and narrator. all-in-all i gave this one 10/10, because it's that good. (i haven't seen specials in dvd version so i cannot comment on those)
