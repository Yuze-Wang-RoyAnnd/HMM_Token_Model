this is no art-house film, it's mainstream entertainment. <br /><br />lot's of beautiful people, t&a, and action. i found it very entertaining. it's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun film to watch! jesse and chace are funny too, which is just gravy. definitely worth a rental.<br /><br />so in summary, i'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it on!)<br /><br />the villains are good too. vinnie, corey large, the hatian guy from heroes. very nasty villains.
