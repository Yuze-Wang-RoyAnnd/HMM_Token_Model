***1/2 pierce brosnan, greg kinnear, hope davis, adam scott, philip baker hall. directed by richard shepard.<br /><br />a well formulated story and film all together, brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his "bond" movies. after 2004's "after the sunset" his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time. professional hit-man, so to speak, julian noble on a job in mexico city winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man danny wright (kinnear, possibly one of his best roles) also on business there. the two on-screen duo produce a comically charged, laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs. davis in one of her best roles since "american splendor" gives another charming and witty performance. one of the years most enjoyable and best films. my final rating 9/10
