i studied charlotte bronte's novel in high school, and it left me with a stunning impression. here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of victorian england. this young woman was jane eyre, a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own. her story, which bronte told through jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. <br /><br />as part of our study, we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story, and it blew me away. the mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great. both zelah clarke (jane eyre) and timothy dalton (jane's lover, by the name of rochester) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters. i cannot imagine anyone else in their roles. (the other performances of rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion, energy, and tenderness needed to portray rochester accurately. i say that timothy dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of rochester. zelah clarke not only looks like jane eyre, but she captures jane's quiet, but firm and passionate nature brilliantly. she holds in her emotions, like the jane of the book, at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in jane's passionate scenes. the chemistry that clarke and dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to jane and rochester's devoted relationship.) as well, the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly, and the sets fit the gothic nature of the story. <br /><br />i strongly recommend this version of the classic bronte tale. if you have not read the book before, then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.
