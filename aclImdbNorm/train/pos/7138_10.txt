if john thaw had never played "morse", "kavanagh", or starred in "the sweeney" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in "goodnight mr tom".<br /><br />superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co-star (young nick robinson in his first role), and an unobtrusive cast, this adaptation of michelle magorian's charming novel is a fitting memorial to his art.<br /><br />when i read this story of an old widowed norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from london before and during the blitz, i found a rather obvious time-line error in it, and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error. they also must be applauded for not over-sentimentalising the tale, and preventing what could have been turned, quite easily, into a mushy mess.<br /><br />if you keep a cd or video library then this feel-good made for tv movie is an absolute must inclusion.
