having not seen the films before (and not being able to stand matt damon), i was reluctant to go see the bourne ultimatum when we were asked to see it for as film studies. <br /><br />however, i was pleasantly surprised that even a film with damon in it could be enjoyable. <br /><br />fast fight scenes, crazy motorbike chases and big explosions were what threw you out of your seat in tbu. the near-misses between the cia and bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained.<br /><br />nevertheless, several things really grated my cheese.<br /><br />firstly, the fact that the film was just a series of bourne, cia, bourne, cia, bourne, cia. this sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull. although damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the cia, i was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of bourne. he crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something! very unrealistic.<br /><br />and secondly (inevitably) - the shaky camera. it was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) seasick. we were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. fair enough if greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching damon and stiles holding a conversation, but surely we wouldn't be shaking our heads that violently!<br /><br />but all in all tbu is an enjoyable film and worth a watch. but i didn't think it was the best film of the year, despite being an entertaining piece of cinema.<br /><br />8/10.
