life pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. the acting is rather amateurish, at best. the special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. the story line is rather stock, but with an interesting twist. computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable. for me, at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of kristine debell. she may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is cute enough. in all life pod is much like other low-budget sci-fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable.<br /><br />the white star lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the cunard lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the britannic (not the sister of titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.
