wow...i don't know what to say. i just watched seven pounds. no one can make me cry like will smith. the man is very in-tune with the vast range of human emotion. this movie was skillfully and beautifully done. rare to find such intense humanity in hollywood today. i would compare it to "pay it forward" and "crash" as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way. definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one. not usually one for a "bad ending" but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion, raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around. therefore i do not mind a little pain at the end. it is true to life that there aren't always happy endings. sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be. many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost. if you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you'll love this movie!
