i always tell people that "enchanted april" is an adult movie with no cussing, no sex, and no violence. one might think of it as "the ultimate chick flick", but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too. don't invite the kids, though. this movie is very low-key.<br /><br />seeing "enchanted april" is a very healing experience. the sound track and gorgeous scenery, along with the ladies' gentle manners, bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre-raphaelite painting.<br /><br />lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie, i will paraphrase a line i heard once on "saturday night live" and say that my two favorite movies are "the deer hunter" and "enchanted april".
