i had never seen such an incredible acting job in a motion picture as i did when i saw daniel day-lewis play christy brown in my left foot. in fact off the scene his role wasn't even over. he played the role of christy brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back. to me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to act that role i believe it is quite true to say he put on the most oscar worthy performance in history. he was so masterful in this tough a part that i believe no one could have done it better or with more of an impact than him. although i cannot say it is the greatest movie of all time i can say that how he played this impossible a role and then kept on acting it until it wasn't even acting anymore is without a doubt the greatest feet i will ever seen an actor do. probably a man too for that matter.
