very good martial arts film and jet li is the best since the master himself bruce lee .li is excellent as the low key librarian/cop who saves all time and time again . he has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you don't mess with .francoise yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage , she has an innocence and an allure all at the same time that i found unforgettable .the villain , the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but i can't find his name in the credits , can some one help me out with that ? thanks ! enjoy hak hap or black mask , in any language its good entertainment !
