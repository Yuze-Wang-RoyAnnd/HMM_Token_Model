this is very dated, but that's part of the charm with this 1933 movie. you can say the same for most pre-code films; they're just different, and usually in an interesting way.<br /><br />it was the short running time, the great acting of spencer tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of loretta young's character which kept me watching and enjoying this stagy-but-intriguing film.<br /><br />you'd be hard-pressed to find a nicer girl than "trinna," played by the 20-year-old young who was already into making her 50th movie! (she started acting as a small child. that, and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days.) the camera, although in soft focus throughout much of the film, zoomed in on loretta's face and eyes many times and i was mesmerized by her beauty.<br /><br />playing a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life, tracy's "bill" slowly transformed into a loving man, thanks to trinna. spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting.<br /><br />although they have small roles, supporting actors walter connolly, marjorie rambeau, arthur hohl and glenda farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this 75-minute film. i was particularly fascinated with connolly's role as the minister/father figure of the camp.<br /><br />the story is a little far-fetched but - hey - that's the movies. this story is about two lonely great depression victims trying to survive in a "hooverville"-type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale.
