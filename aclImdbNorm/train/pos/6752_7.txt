a detective (dana andrews) with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder (craig stevens) and then tries to cover it up. the otto preminger directed film has plenty of atmosphere but the story gets watered down when the dead man's wife (gene tierney) falls for andrews. he was doing fairly well digging himself into and out of a big hole, but she was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir film. gary merrill is great as scalese, a crime boss that andrews is obsessed with bringing down, and the tension between them gives the film its energy and drive, especially a scene in a bath house with merrill, andrews, and neville brand, and the night time rendezvous outside of bellevue hospital, that sets up what ought to have been the film's conclusion. high marks for atmosphere, andrews, merrill, etc... and the general portrayal of the underworld, though the love angle and the simplistic good cop bad cop elements don't help its cause.
