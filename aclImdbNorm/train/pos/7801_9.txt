this movie is using cinematography fantastically, the depth of the camera catches each character. denzel washington and kevin kline put on awesome performances though washingtons accent does die in certain scenes. how is this movie laying forgotten? unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever. a worrying idea. attenborough at his best since ghandi, this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these, no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the south african apartheid.though critised for the biased nature, the movie is faithful to the book by donald woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world. ta and peace
