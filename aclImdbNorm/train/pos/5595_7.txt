polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in repulsion and rosemary's baby, in the tenant.<br /><br />the atmosphere is trademark polanski - dark, brooding, unnerving - but there is something awkward about this movie and i am not sure whether or not it is deliberate.<br /><br />sven nykvist, who was responsible for some of bergman's most beautiful films, doesn't quite do himself justice here. as his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie, i was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film.<br /><br />the only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting. polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of trelkovsky. some of the supporting cast are great, notably melvyn douglas as the landlord and shelley winters as the concierge, but others are weak and miscast. it is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed parisians have american accents.<br /><br />quite unexpectedly, there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film. anyone who has seen the fearless vampire killers knows that polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. however, there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself. trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) 'transformation' is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows, which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey.<br /><br />all in all, the tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience, if a little too languorous for its own good. there's a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film, while being very good, does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have.<br /><br />alas, at the end of the day, an 'okay' polanski movie is still better than most other 'good' movies. definitely worth a watch, just don't expect to be blown away.
