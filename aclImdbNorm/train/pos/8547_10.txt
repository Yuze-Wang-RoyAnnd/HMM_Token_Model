a lot of people hated this movie, but that i blame on two facts - 1 - they want it to be too much like the first couple of american pie movies. and 2 - they are trying to take it too seriously.<br /><br />this one i found was the best one out of all six, and i absolutely love dwight. the plot is predictable, i'll say that, but then what teen comedy isn't? road trip, dirty deeds etc etc, they are all incredibly predictable, but still goddamn funny! i say this is worth watching, i love it, i find it hilarious. just don't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it's nothing alike.<br /><br />after watching naked mile and this one, it became obvious that all the american pie movies were about, and only about, the stiflers. which is fine by me.<br /><br />watch. enjoy. love. xd
