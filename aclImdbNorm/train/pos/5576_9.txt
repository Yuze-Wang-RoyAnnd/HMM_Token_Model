this movie is hilarious! i watched it with my friend and we just had to see it again. this movie is not for you movie-goers who will only watch the films that are nominated for academy awards (you know who you are.)i won't recap it because you have seen that from all the other reviews.<br /><br />"whipped" is a light-hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout. it doesn't take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends, not your girlfriend. it won't win any awards, but it just has to be watched to be appreciated. true, some of the jokes are toilet humor, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. everyone can use some of it sometimes. some people need to lighten up and see "whipped" for what it is, not what it isn't.<br /><br />****1/4 out of *****.
