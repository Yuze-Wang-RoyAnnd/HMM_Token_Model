"slaughter high" is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty,who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters.the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned.five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion-just the ten of them of course,and low and behold marty murders them one after another.british actress caroline munro("maniac")leads the cast as the heroine(who dies anyway!).the acting is completely awful,there's also no suspense at all.plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore-freaks:a guy's stomach explodes,another female victim literally gets an acid bath,a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted,a guy is crushed by a tractor,one girl is drowned,and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye.the killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester's mask and the setting(a beautiful old english castle)is really nice.however the dream finale is utterly pathetic.all in all it's true that "slaughter high" is a piece of garbage,but i enjoyed it.only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks.
