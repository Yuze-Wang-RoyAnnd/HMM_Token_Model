although it's most certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk, there's such a charm to dudley moore's portrayal of lovable lush, arthur bach one can't help but feel for this unique and wonderful character. how can you not be entertained by that infectious laugh and giggle and utter silliness. although i'm not really a liza minnelli fan, she was really excellent as linda marolla and i couldn't picture anyone else in that role. sir john gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his oscar. the rest of the cast also excellent and that great tune "arthur's theme", wow. truly this was one of the best comedies of the 1980s. great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with "arthur."
