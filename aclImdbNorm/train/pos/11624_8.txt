red eye, a movie that id had wanted to see for awhile...cillian murphy plays jack ripner (jack the ripper) a managerial pose to assassins, and his literally killer plan to knock off a highly profiled man and his family.<br /><br />an everyday woman "lisa" (i think) is a normal woman, goes to work, home...worries...hates to fly.<br /><br />the death of her grandmother sends her on a flight which delayed several times.<br /><br />a flight where she meets jack...an ordinary seeming guy, until he suavely reveals his profession and plans, which coincidentally include her in them, she is the key to the keefe's (sp?) death.<br /><br />she succeeds in saving them...but nearly the cost of her life is taken, jack is beaten...the keefs are saved...oh what a story *laughs* just kidding, the movie is really good actually, the best of last year...there are small things that you have to pay attention to earlier in the movie that play a great importance to the movie later... (the frankenstein pen) i watched it several times before catching all the little jokes and quirks...<br /><br />a must see for thriller fans no sexual, but there is a slight hint (the bathroom scene) (jack) "thanks for the quicky" and the (female attendant) "ohhh...its gonna be one of those flights" (second female attendant) "hey! this isn't a motel" you get the idea...
