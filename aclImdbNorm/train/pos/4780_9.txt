always fancied this film from the video cover. eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film. a simply stunning performance from all of the case and it's filmed so beautifully. even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is, as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale. it's really moving, frequently amusing and very watchable. not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout. a 9/10 from me. a must see.
