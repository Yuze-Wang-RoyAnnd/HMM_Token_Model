the daughter's words are poetry: "i can't go on another year. i got to get to a hotel room." "i lost my blue scarf in a sea of leaves." "the marble faun is moving in...he just gave us a washing machine. that's the deal." "i'm pulverized by this latest thing." "..raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time." "..any little rat's nest, mouse hole i'd like better." and there is wisdom in the mother's words: "...yes the pleasure is all mine." "this little book will keep me straight, straight as a dye." "always one must do everything correctly." "where the hell did you come from?" "...bring me my little radio i've got to have some professional music." "i'm your mother. remember me?" the mother/daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film. this is a mother's day film.
