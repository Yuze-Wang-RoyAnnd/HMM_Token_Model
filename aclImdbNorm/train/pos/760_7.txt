i had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the vhs version of it. the plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick. the music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. the breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "breakin'", but i have to say that "breakin' 1&2" carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. it's a movie i will keep in my library, but it's not a movie that i can watch over & over again, just once in a blue moon.
