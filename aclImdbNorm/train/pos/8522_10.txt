i found this show really late at night, and gave it a try. it's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night, if you catch my drift. its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children. it's something i indulge in whenever i find it on (which is rare, maybe i should actually check the listings! haha)..... and the tension between joe and nick is so cute. like any good chick flick, you really get emotionally involved in the characters. good ol' louisa may alcott still inspiring good stories :) so apparently i must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid, so i guess i'll tell you a bit more. the kids are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are lovely and nature-filled -- another thing you don't see much on television. i hope everyone gives it a shot. i recognize and am fully aware that it's sappy, but it's good heart. like i said before, it's refreshing.
