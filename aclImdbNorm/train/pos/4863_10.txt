back when musicals weren't showcases for choreographers, we had wonderful movies such as this one.<br /><br />being a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie. not quite a blend of wodehouse and hollywood, but close enough. some of the american vaudeville humour, the slapstick not the witty banter, clash with wodehouse's british sense of humour. but on the whole, the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures.<br /><br />some inventive staging for the dance numbers, including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors, more than make up for the lack of a busby berkley over the top dance number. they seem a lot more realistic, if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic.<br /><br />the lack of ginger rogers and eric blore don't hurt the movie, instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge. it's also nice not to have a wise cracking, headstrong love interest. instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest, far more in keeping with wodehouses' young aristocratic females.
