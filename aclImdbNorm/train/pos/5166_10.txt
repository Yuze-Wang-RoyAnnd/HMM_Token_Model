indian summer! it was very nostalgic for me. i found it funny, heartwarming, and absolutely loved it! anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the "good ole' days" for a brief time really needs to see this one! it starts out as 20 years later, a group of old campers returns for a "reunion". i won't comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself. the actors were great, and it contains an all star cast. everyone in it played a terrific role. you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it. alan arkin was especially good in his role as uncle lou. he plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives. this is also a good family movie for the most part. i would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat! highly recommended!
