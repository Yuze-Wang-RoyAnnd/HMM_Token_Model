there have been countless talking-animal films in the past, the majority of which either feature animals' mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting, or are ridiculously amateur. 'homeward bound: the incredible journey' is neither.<br /><br />this film doesn't need the infant-pleasing addition of moving canine lips, or gesturing feline limbs. it has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another, and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart (as all great boy-and-and-his-dog films should).<br /><br />homeward bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal romps to me, and boasts some beautiful cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (from the genius of bruce broughton), and an impressive cast...<br /><br />michael j. fox ... chance<br /><br />sally field ... sassy<br /><br />don ameche ... shadow<br /><br />frank welker (voice god) ... various<br /><br />it is a modernised version of the children's classic work of fiction 'the incredible journey', which was made into a semi-documentary film by disney long long ago in 1963. the sequel (lost in san fransisco) isn't nearly as good a film, but extends the adventure of my favourite furry-footed friends, and is a fun urban-twist on the grand-outdoor-adventure theme. want to entertain your children with a witty, pretty, heart-warming mini-epic, without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? parents, buy all three films for your children - now! thank you, disney, for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time i watch this early-90s classic!
