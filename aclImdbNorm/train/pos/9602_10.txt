darius goes west is a film depicting american belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. this wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected, but longed to see, what was outside the confines of his lovely city of athens, ga. darius wished to see the ocean. his longtime friends logan, ben and several other good friends decided to make darius' wish come true. they started small - ben & logan's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to darius' condition: duchenne muscular dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great united states. to say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. they realized darius' dream and then some. they put their lives on hold while showing love, care and tons of fun to darius while helping darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from dmd. darius went on to volunteer for the red cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his buddies) outside a local grocery store. his wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. give darius and all the guys an oscar - no one else deserves it more. martha sweeney.
