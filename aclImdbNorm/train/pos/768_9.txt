cinematically, this film stinks. so does a lot of the acting. but i<br /><br />don't care. if there is a strong representation of what the 80's were<br /><br />like(for a lot of us in the innercity anyways) and what hip-hop, zulu<br /><br />nation, and break dancing were really like.great music, great<br /><br />dancing! it almost seems like a documentary of a time now past<br /><br />when hip-hop was a way of life. it's also interesting to see new<br /><br />york looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack. some viewers<br /><br />may be too young to remember that it was a poor, run down city<br /><br />during the 70's and 80's. this is the best of all the hip-hop/break<br /><br />dancing movies that came out around that period. of course the<br /><br />80's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows and<br /><br />movies, but those of us who lived through it will always remember<br /><br />it fondly for a time when music, dancing, and graffiti were fresh, yo!
