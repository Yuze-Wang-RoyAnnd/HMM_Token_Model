this is a great movie for the true romantics and sports lovers alike.<br /><br />drew barrymore is at her best in this movie. as a drew fan it was quite nice to see her shine after having several flops. i had my doubts about jimmy fallon but he totally delivered as ben the comical, sports crazed sweetheart. the comedy in this movie is great, there were several laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />their first date started rocky when he showed up at her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach from eating a new place earlier in the day. instead of leaving he helps take care of her, helping her change into pajama's then cleaning up the puke on her toilet and bathroom later telling her that she was 'very lady-like...no chunks.' everything goes great between ben and lindsay the whole winter but then baseball season starts. lindsay starts to realize just how obsessed ben is with the red sox and why this seemingly great guy is still single. she tries to shrug it off and think of it as a good thing as she has a busy work schedule and she wont feel guilty for working extra hours while he is at games. she even buys all the books on the red sox she can find including one on 'the curse of bambino'.<br /><br />everything is going pretty well until lindsay has a false alarm having missed her period. it both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with. a very touching part in the movie is after she tells him she got her period it shows him sadly putting away a baby sized red sox jersey he had bought just in case she was pregnant.<br /><br />eventually ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends birthday party after she said "i had to check my calender and when i saw the there was a red sox/yankee game i knew i would be going stag'. after the party ben tells her it was 'the best night of his life'. shortly after he gets a call from his pal who went to the game he gave up for the party and told him "it was the best game ever!!!" ben freaks out about missing it and ends up really hurting lindsay when she says "a few minutes ago you were saying this was the best night of your life" he says "well that was a few minutes ago."<br /><br />so they separate for a while, he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets which he inherited from his uncle because if he didn't it would 'remind him too much of what he gave up for them'. lindsay finds out through a friend and decides to stop him realizing he is doing it for her. it ends very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball has been over shadowed for a whole new deeper love, lindsay. they still go to the games and even attend the final world series game and st. louis and it is a happy ending all around. 2 thumbs up!!
