i really enjoyed the reunion a lot! i would have rated it a 10 if they had had "hassie" and "little luke". there wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion. they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance.<br /><br />anyway, i was glad that tnn ran the series again! i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series (i may have missed a few episodes). jenny hanahan
