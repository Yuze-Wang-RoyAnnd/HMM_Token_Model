i'm not a writer or an critic...i'm just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago....and i want to thank people that worked on creating this movie!it is not the best or the most.... but it touched my heart...why???i would like to understand it myself...it is easy and accessible..it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it!it is about love and caring, about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff .......look at all the time that we have but we miss it....why a fu*k do we do that???we need to live like were dying ...care about every second and remember:if we do good things-good things come back to us!happiness is real...and it has a special taste in new york...i love this town and the world the we live in!!!!thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes(english is my second language)...
