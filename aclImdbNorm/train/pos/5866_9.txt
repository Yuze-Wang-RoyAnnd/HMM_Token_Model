jacknife is a war movie that is just about as far removed from the war as war movies get. it can hardly be classified as a war film, because the only way that any war has an effect on the story or the characters is in their memories of it, and even these we are hardly ever shown. it poses very interesting questions about life, especially in the way that the movie's tagline says that only one of them is really alive (and by the way, even though the tagline refers only to dave (ed harris) and megs (robert deniro), it is talking about all three of the characters in the film). dave and megs were friends in the vietnam war, and megs has returned to take dave out on a fishing trip that they have been planning for a lot longer than you might have guessed. <br /><br />deniro provides a perfect performance of the character of megs, who we are not really sure if we should like or if he really is as nuts as martha thinks he is. dave reminds martha several times that megs is not his friend, just someone he knows. there is a great scene early in the film where megs has gone out to grab a six pack of beer from his car for breakfast, and he is just around the corner of the room when dave says this. megs pauses for a moment and then proceeds into the room with a smile and a huge greeting. it isn't until later that you realize how megs must have felt when he heard that, having been the one to remember what they had planned to do on this day. it reminds me of the fakeness of the old, `sure, let's do that,' thing that people so often say to each other, never having any plans to do any such thing.<br /><br />ed harris delivers a wonderful performance as dave, who never got over the effects that the war had on him. even so many years later he has not managed to get over the death of a friend during the war, blaming himself to this day for it and thus drowning his life in alcohol, cigarettes, and loneliness. all he wants, he says, is for people to leave him alone. this is not a man who is living his life the way he wants, whether people actually leave him alone or not, he is a man trying to forget that he's alive, to detach himself from the world of the living as much as possible.<br /><br />his sister martha reminds me of myself, at least in terms of my roommates. i have two roommates who are 21 and 24 years old, and both act like they still live with their mothers, expecting their messes to just go away when they leave the room for a while. one on particular (the older one, sadly enough), has absolutely no clue how to care for himself, i'm surprised i don't have to wipe his chin while he eats. martha has to do much the same for her brother, who she waits on hand and foot while he staggers through life from one hangover to the next. martha and dave are stuck in a stagnant life and neither of them can get out of it until something major changes, and dave is the one that needs to do the changing. <br /><br />i tend to complain about romance in movies where it just doesn't belong about as much as roger ebert complains about those pathetic little tension devices, the red digital readout. but in this case, i don't think that the romance that develops between megs and martha had any adverse affect on the rest of the movie. on the contrary, it made it that much more interesting, because it was not predictable. the problem with the romantic subplots in bruckheimer movies and whatnot is that they are so predictable that you just wait for the obvious end to come and hope that something interesting happens along the way. in this case, however, it's not as obvious that something is going to happen between megs and martha because we don't know enough about megs. martha could be right about him, that he's one of dave's crazy war buddies and that he's not the kind of man that she should be dating. dave certainly encourages this idea.<br /><br />(spoilers) a couple years after this movie, deniro did cape fear, where he plays a deranged criminal out for revenge against the lawyer that landed him in prison, a character that, in retrospect, makes it pretty easy to think that maybe at the end of jacknife martha realizes her mistake, gets rid of megs, and she and dave make up because he saved her from a horrible relationship and then he decides to clean up his act because he has done something good for her. i was half expecting this to happen, so i was pleasantly surprised when martha and megs wound up together and even more pleasantly surprised when megs asks dave all the questions about what they had planned to do after the war was over. <br /><br />at times this is a slow moving drama, but jacknife is entertaining along the way and has a huge payoff at the end, which amazingly manages to be sappy without being cheesy. there is an almost excess of emotion at the end of the film that scarcely fits with the rest of the movie, but it is so good that it doesn't dumb down anything that the movie has accomplished up to that point. everyone involved gives a wonderful performance, and it is one of those rare films that just about makes you want to stand up and shake your fists victoriously in the air.
