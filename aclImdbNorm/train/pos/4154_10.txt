this was one of the all time best episodes. officer sean cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in '68. a dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting. his case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman.<br /><br />further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love. this type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time.<br /><br />while this isn't the type of love i personally support, he was still a policeman and a human being and shouldn't have been killed for it. the sound track was excellent (keeps me watching the dvr), and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing. i shall be watching this one in repeat!
