even 15 years after the end of the vietnam war "jacknife" came not too late or was even superfluous. it's one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war: the time after. different from movies like "taxi driver" or "rambo" which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the vietnam vets. their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. the problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship. "jacknife" might be the quietest vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified. moreover, it can make us believe that the war has not finished, yet; at least for some of us.<br /><br />the three main characters are amazing. de niro has done one of his best jobs but ed harris is the star of this movie. possibly,this was his best performance ever.
