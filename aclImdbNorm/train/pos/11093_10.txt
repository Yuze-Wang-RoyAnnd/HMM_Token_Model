this is a great "small" film. i say "small" because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions, as in a john woo film. great performances by roy scheider and the three "bad guys". john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. the film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine--instead of everything going around and around, it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens. wonderful ending, very positive. i never read the elmore leonard book, but it can't be much different from the film because it feels like i'm watching an elmore leonard movie.
