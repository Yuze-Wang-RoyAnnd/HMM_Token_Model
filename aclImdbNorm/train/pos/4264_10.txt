i happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made! wwii had freshly ended and the so-called "cold war" was about to begin. this movie could, therefore, be defined as one of the best "propaganda", patriotic movies preparing americans and, secondly, people from the still to be formed "western nato block" of countries to face the next coming menace. the movie celebrates the might of the us, through the centuries, while projecting itself onwards to the then present war, which had just ended. nice and funny is the way of describing the discovering of the american continent by columbus and pretty the "espisode" of new amsterdam and the purchasing of manhattan from a drunk local indian .. must see it (at least once, for curiosity of fashion of propaganda through time)! :)
