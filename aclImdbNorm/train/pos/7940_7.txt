eye in the labyrinth is not your average giallo...and to be honest, i'm not really sure that it really is a giallo; but giallo or not, despite some problems, this is certainly a very interesting little film. i'm hesitant to call it a giallo because the film doesn't feature most of the things that make these films what they are; but many genre entries break the mould, and this would seem to be one of them. the film doesn't feature any brutal murders as many giallo's do, but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration. the plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by julie, his patient who, for some reason, she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her. we then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people, but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before julie's arrival...<br /><br />the film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth. this never really comes off, and i preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point (if any) the film is trying to make. eye in the labyrinth is directed by mario caiano, the director behind the excellent night of the doomed some years earlier. he doesn't create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one; but the surreal aspects of the story come off well, and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring. the film stars rosemary dexter, who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance. most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning, with the exceptions of adolfo celi, who is good as the villain of the piece and alida valli, whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks. the film does explain itself at the end; which is lucky as i'm sure i'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then! overall, this may not be classic stuff; but its good enough and worth seeing.
