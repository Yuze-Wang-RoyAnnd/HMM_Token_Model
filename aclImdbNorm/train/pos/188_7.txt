i'm a huge classic film buff, but am just getting in to silent movies. a lot of silent films don't hold my attention, but show people is a notable exception.<br /><br />marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture. davies, in particular, shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously.<br /><br />show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era. the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film. (i know that doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened.) the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary.<br /><br />show people is a perfect introduction to silent films. it is a fast paced, interesting film with two of the silent era's best stars. add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the 'must see' list for all classic film buffs.
