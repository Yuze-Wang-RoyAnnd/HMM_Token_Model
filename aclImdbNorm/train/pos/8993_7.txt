rock n' roll is a messy business and dig! demonstrates this masterfully. a project of serious ambition, and perhaps foolhardiness, the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups. with that said, the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience. if you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing. the music in the film, although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting, is worth the price of admission alone. the morning after i saw dig! i went straight to the record store to pick up a brian jonestown massacre album (i was already initiated to the dandy warhols' sounds). primarily defined by its exploration of rock music, the film succeeds at other profound levels. dig! is a sincere, and sufficiently objective, glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces.
