i like ghost stories. good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. now i've see many of them. as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films, some times to find a real gem , you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. now this one, very rare , pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called " the new house " was one of the most scariest films i ever saw. it was on once in 1972,...i was only 9,..but nothing since then even compared to it. with all the remake going on in hollywood, some one should do this one " as is " with no more special efx than the original. this episode was down right creepy as hell. i'm lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find. the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original " the haunting " and george c. scott in " the changling " . wish someone would do more ghost stories like these.
