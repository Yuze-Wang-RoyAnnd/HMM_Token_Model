this film got terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics don't usually "get" offbeat films, i thought i'd give it a try. unfortunately they were largely right in this instance.<br /><br />the film just has an awkward feel too it that is most off putting. the sort of feel that is impossible to describe, but it's not a good one. to further confound things, the script is a dull aimless thing that is only vaguely interesting.<br /><br />the immensely talented thurman just drifts through this mess creating barely an impact. hurt and bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script. it may have been less embarrassing for them if they had merely chosen to drift and get it over with like thurman.<br /><br />one thing the "esteemed" film critics did fail to mention however is that the film is actually quite funny. whether it be moments of accurate satire or some outrageously weird moments like when the cowgirls in question chase hurt off their ranch with the smell of their unwashed...ahem...front bottoms.<br /><br />because of the chortles acheived throughout, while i wouldn't recommend this film, there is entertainment to be had and watching even cowgirls get the blues is worthwhile for something different.
