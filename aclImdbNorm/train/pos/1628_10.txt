this is bar none the most hilarious movie i have ever seen. beginning with the four delinquents being sent off by their fathers to wienberg military academy, a tone is set that steadily continues all throughout this goofball film, and it does not let up for a second.<br /><br />it's tough trying to describe this film; the humor elements are so spot on and brilliantly concieved that upon a first look it appears as nothing more than a stupid 80's teen lust comedy. but it is oh so much more than that! fresh from the minds of those folks over at mad magazine, up the academy serves up a formula and style that i have never since seen duplicated by any of the "funniest" offerings to come out of hollywood in years past. basically the film is so full of infantile cornball material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of 14 year olds themselves. see this movie if you love to act "immature." a classic. *****
