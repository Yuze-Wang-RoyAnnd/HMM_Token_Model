this movie does contradict the first one as far as the origins of the care bears and the care bear cousins goes. i won't deny that. however, if you look at "part ii" as a separate film, then it's a very good movie. i remember watching this in the early 80's (and fitting into its targeted demographic audience then), and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie (not that i didn't enjoy that one too, it's just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it). sure it's darker than the first one too, but perhaps maybe that's why it's so good. and it's dark in deeper kind of subtle way too (that kids may not fully understand, but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off, and adults watching will surely get quicker as i have now watching this film again now in my mid-twenties) where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit/demon in exchange for something else. get the picture? but simply watching that as a child, sure as i said it may have been a little scary, but nothing traumatizing. in fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game i could play when i was that age. i can't tell you the number of times i used to pretend dark heart wanted to imprison me, have me help him capture the care bears, tried to make me turn over to his dark side, and other things like that etc. so this movie was also good for my imagination. and it's also got great emotional depth to it too. i used to watch it at least once a week.<br /><br />also hadley kay was the perfect choice for the voice of dark heart (i always thought so and i always will).<br /><br />now it's just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available. sometimes i just want to hear growing up without watching the movie, as good as it is.<br /><br />"what good is love and caring if it can't save her?"
