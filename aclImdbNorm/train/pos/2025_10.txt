anne brontes epic novel the tenant of wildfell hall should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and peoples living rooms. its a fantastic story and tells the "real" truth on alcoholism and ruined marriages and a mothers fight to keep her son away from her brutal husband. its so alike todays stories that we see and hear and i believe people can learn a lot from reading this book. based on possible true experiences that the author had back in the 1840s.<br /><br />do watch this film, its a great version of the book and very moving indeed. i'm sure anne herself would have been happy with the way it was produced.<br /><br />excellent acting and great locations.
