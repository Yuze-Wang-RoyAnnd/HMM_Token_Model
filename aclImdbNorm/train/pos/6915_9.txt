textbook example of an underestimated movie.<br /><br />although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it, it's still regarded as just another funny picture. and although the movie has inspired many and added it's quotes and images to the pyche of all it's viewers, moon over parador still hasn't received the acclaim it should. even the brilliant cast with academy award winner richard dreyfuss and raul julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception.<br /><br />but after watching raul julia as roberto strausmann make richard dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is timeless! in fifty years we will have the proof.
