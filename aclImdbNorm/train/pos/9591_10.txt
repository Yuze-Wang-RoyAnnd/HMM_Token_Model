an excellent documentry. i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early 80's. this movie is for anyone that wasn't around during that time period.this shows the one thing the african american gay underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real. the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written. the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties. that time is gone forever. this is a good pre "homo thug" movie. when queens were really proud to be extroverts. goodbye to storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film!
