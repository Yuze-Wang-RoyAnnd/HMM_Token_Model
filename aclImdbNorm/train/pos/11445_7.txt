a new way to enjoy goldsworthy's work, rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion. watching goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. although, i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), i do feel it was a bit long. the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthy's work to life, and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.
