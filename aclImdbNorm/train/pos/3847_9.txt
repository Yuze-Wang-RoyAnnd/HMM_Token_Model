in it's time, this movie had controversy written all over it (like most of verhoeven's projects).<br /><br />containing very graphic depictions death-scenes; a parachute that doesn't open *smack* guys body on the floor. a guy being eaten by a lion *chomp* teeth in the throat. and a guy being run over by a speedboat *zoom* bloody corpse going down.<br /><br />but besides gore, this flick also contains some brilliant (and stunningly beautiful) scenes, filmed in the gray fisher's town that is vlissingen;<br /><br />thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen, in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie, a beautiful (holy) woman putting flowers in a milk-can, surrounded by slabs of blood-dripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters, in a graveyard.<br /><br />the story is concluded in a frantic, but fulfilling 10 minutes, that don't disappoint, and will leave you sighing a breath of relief.<br /><br />of course with the pros come the cons, some special-effects are too over-the-top, and are obviously done to see how far verhoeven could push the gore-factor (e.g. the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets). also, while the two lead actors, (jeroen krabb'e and ren'ee soutendijk), do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters, the character of herman (portrayed by the rather un-charming thom hoffman) just feels enormously underdeveloped, making him hard to care for, even after his tragic death.<br /><br />i've done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie, and as you can see, it's not easily summed up in words. so do yourself a favor, if you happen to find this movie somewhere, watch it ! and enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.
