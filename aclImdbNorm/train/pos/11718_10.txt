those who love elivra as i did in her late night movie hostess duties will love this movie - she is just plain cool - her car is great, and she is a bit of a transylvanian dolly parton - she is so innocent and naive at times - and sexy all of the time - plus, more than a touch of mae west -<br /><br />the sets are well done as well, and the comic cast is great, with edie mcclurg at her usual best - plus sally kellerman as patty is hilarious. any time i have to crunch something for a topping, i will think of how elvira crunches the potato chips -<br /><br />this movie is one to be watched again and again - just for the fun of it. now i have to get the sequel to it, elvira's haunted hills, and see if it lives up to this one ----
