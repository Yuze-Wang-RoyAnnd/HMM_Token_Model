part ii or formerly known as guerilla, is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as part i because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of che guevara. once again, i'm impressed by the cause-and-effect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories. we're reminded again and again that the lead character, che guevara is an argentine. some of the men in fidel's army chose not to take orders from a foreigner and now that che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in bolivia, he doesn't get much respect from his new army and the natives either, only because he's a foreigner.<br /><br />as far as technical goes, i think part ii would've been more helpful if before everything else, right after the display of the map, it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what he's set himself on doing, to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in cuba but they don't work in bolivia. it is clear now in this segment, that che is not as charismatic as fidel castro. in bolivia, he's dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it. it's said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love.. well, they don't give a damn that much about their country so it's a tough sell. it's excruciatingly painful and difficult for che to get the others to buy into his vision.<br /><br />i like one particular scene that illustrates che's deteriorating condition, a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly che tries to direct it, and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there, he forgets he's a doctor, and he becomes this desperate soldier who's stabs his own horse. his army is like a horse that doesn't want to be led. but at the same time, the film drags, it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that you'll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part, you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another, but maybe that is the intention of part ii, if so.. then it definitely works. standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of che's last breath. this movie may not answer the questions of why che guevara was so stubborn, why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants south america to have the same fate as cuba but the movie che is a story worth telling.
