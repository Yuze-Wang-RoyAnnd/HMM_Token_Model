ok, so i don't watch too many horror movies - and the reason is films like 'dark remains'. i caught this on (a surprisingly feature-filled) dvd and it scared me silly. in fact the only extra i think the dvd was missing was a pair of new pants.<br /><br />however, the next day i was telling someone about it when i realised i'd only really seen about 10% of it. the rest of the time i'd been watching the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if i actually covered my eyes. the few times i did brave watching the screen i jumped so hard that i decided not to look up again.<br /><br />the film-making is solid and the characters' situation was really compelling. the simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump-button - it's merely a woodland, a cabin and a disused jail - and a lot of darkness. most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi-million dollar production, the make-up effects really looked like it was! also, it's obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of film-making. the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many hollywood movies have never done. i noticed on-line that this film won the la shriekfest - a really major achievement, and i guess that the festival had seen the filmmakers' clear talent - and probably a great deal more of this movie than i managed to.<br /><br />turn up the sound, turn off the lights, and, if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.
