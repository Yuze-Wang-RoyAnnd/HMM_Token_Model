the plot intellect is about as light as feather down. but the advantage here is the boy and girl classic refusal we have become accustomed to in "the gay divorcee" and "top hat" is now absent. instead of the typical accidental acquaintance, the dancing duo are the former lovers bake baker and sherry martin, who are still in love since their dancing days.<br /><br />of course, being a 30s musical, there's the problems of misunderstood romance, classy courtship and the slight irritation of a sabotaged audition with bicarbonate soda has costing ginger something rather special. and then in the grand tradition of dwindling finances, there's nothing better for hollywood's best entertainers than put on a show.<br /><br />delightful numbers from irving berlin are sprinkled throughout the show. top hats and evening dresses are saved right until the end, which remains a refreshing change. fred and ginger are out again to charm the world...and charm the navy. everyone and everything is once again just so enjoyable.<br /><br />pure classic silliness at its best. but with astaire and rogers, we just know it's got to work.<br /><br />rating: 8.25/10
