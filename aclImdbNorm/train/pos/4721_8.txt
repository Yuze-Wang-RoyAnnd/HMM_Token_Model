sad story of a downed b-17 pilot. brady is shot down over occupied territory. the local ranchers extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives. i had never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours. after the film is over, i'm glad i took the time. it's an entire story told to explain the look on brady's face at the start of the film.
