cult classics are nearly impossible to predict. who could guess that vision quest, fight club, and 2001: a space oddysey, movies that were panned by critics and audiences alike upon their release, would become immensely popular? like many imdbers, i consider myself a movie expert. unlike the majority of those who hated envy(evidenced by a dismal 4.4 rating), i found envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade.<br /><br />the plot of the movie is ridiculous. the dialogue isn't clever, the scenes have little continuity, and the script seems like it was written by a fourth grader. but that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious. you see, in order to appreciate the accidental genius of envy, you have to enjoy the movie from an ironically-detached point of view.<br /><br />why do i love envy? because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good. this is the recipe for a cult classic, and envy definitely fits the bill.
