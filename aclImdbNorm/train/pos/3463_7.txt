i am a big beatles fan. my favorite beatle is paul and my least favorite is john. i already knew quite a bit about the beatles music and the truth behind the breakup, as well as things like john lennon's family and paul's band wings. i was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between john and paul so many years after the breakup.<br /><br />i was not disappointed by this movie. although the story itself is fiction, many of the references that the two musicians used were very accurate. these included how yoko ono would always be with john wherever he went, the wings song "silly love songs" being the number one hit that year and the concert on the roof of apple studios playing music from the album "let it be."<br /><br />the actors did a very good job in playing john and paul. the accents could had used maybe a bit more work, but they seemed to act a lot like i've read the two former-beatles used to act like. i also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the entire movie was.<br /><br />the ending at first disappointed me, but the more you think about it the more you will appreciate it, especially since this was how it really went in real life. they also show the fantastic skit from "saturday night live" in which the beatles are offered $3,000 to perform on the show. (as compared to the $220 million others were offering them) overall, i was not disappointed with this movie. it does really give you more of a feel for why the beatles broke up and why they never got back together.
