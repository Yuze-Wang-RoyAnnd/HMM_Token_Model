this film was great.<br /><br />the plot was preposterous.<br /><br />the action sequences contrived.<br /><br />but, provided you can lighten up enough to laugh, it was a throughly thrilling romp combining keystone cops and the lone ranger.<br /><br />the baddies were more silly than bad. the good guys weren't too good. the black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes.<br /><br />the inclusion of a baby added a good touch. sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise. <br /><br />i have to disagree about the acting. it was, on the whole, very good. i really wanted to punch judge reinhold.<br /><br />and, after all, isn't that the mark of a really good movie, wanting to punch judge reinhold?
