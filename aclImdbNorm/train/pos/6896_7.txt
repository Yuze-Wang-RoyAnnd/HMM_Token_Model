this is the last of four swashbucklers from france i've scheduled for viewing during this christmas season: the others (in order of viewing) were the uninspired the black tulip (1964; from the same director as this one but not nearly as good), the surprisingly effective lady oscar (1979; which had originated as a japanese manga!) and the splendid cartouche (1962). actually, i had watched this one not too long ago on late-night italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it, so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around (also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion).<br /><br />incidentally, fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the afore-mentioned cartouche: not just cast and crew members (producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine, cinematographer christian matras, actor noel roquevert) but plot-wise as well
