i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but it is nothing new.<br /><br />everyone here is grouping it with other war movies, this movie has been miscategorized! its not a war movie any more than "one flew over the cuckoos nest" is a asylum movie or "cool hand luke" is a prison movie. this is a movie about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the costs of that personality type.<br /><br />the plot is the same as "one flew over the cuckoos nest" and "cool hand luke", its in good company, and it holds its own. its these movies it should be held up against and compared, not "apocalypse now" or "platoon".<br /><br />eric
