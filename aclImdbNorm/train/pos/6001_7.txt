by no means a masterpiece, and far from errol flynn's best, istanbul still has much going for it. the locations and beautiful technicolour cinematography, bring us back to a time long since past. errol flynn does show moments of his past glory, and is ok as jim brennan, a pilot who's past comes back to haunt him. the picture is actually a remake of 1947's "singapore", and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche' by today's standards. also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply "going through the motions" in this picture. many people have also compared it to one of the all time greats, casablanca. while watching the film, i could see many of the similarities, but hey, casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take that for what it's worth. in closing, if you are a fan of flynn, or old fashioned love stories, you might want to give this film a look. otherwise, i'd recommend casablanca, or the maltese falcon, as a good introduction to some of hollywood's classics....
