paul (jason lee) is an underachiever who just happens to be engaged to a type-a princess named karen (selma blair). she chooses his clothes and his daily schedule. at his bachelor party, paul gets a little too drunk and somehow ends up taking a pretty dancer named becky (julia stiles) back to his digs. "nothing happened", as they say, but the duo do wake up in the same bed. suddenly karen telephones. she's on her way to paul's apartment. understandably, paul hustles becky out of the place, although her underpants are left behind. but, there is even more fun ahead. at a family dinner at karen's parents' home, paul runs smack into becky again, learning that she is karen's cousin. talk about some explaining to do! but, instead, paul chooses to feign a stomach problem and hides out in the bathroom. will karen ever find out that becky spent the night at paul's place? and, what will be the consequences? i'm sorry for critics who pan movies like this. they should definitely lighten up, for this film is fresh and fun. of course, it doesn't hurt matters that lee is a consummate funny man, stiles is a charming beauty or that blair is a natural as a pretty but anal fianc'ee. the rest of the cast, including james brolin and julie haggerty, is also quite nice. the look of the film is wonderful, as are the costumes and california settings. best of all, the script is imaginative and inspired, creating big laughs for the audience. in short, if you want to tickle the proverbial funnybones, get this movie tonight. it may not be academy award material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a darn good one.
