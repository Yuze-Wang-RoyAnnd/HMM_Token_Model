2005 toronto film festival report it is official; "takashi miike" is whacked.<br /><br />the annual midnight screening of the new "takashi miike" film, "the big spook war" or "the great yokai war" or "y^okai daisens^o". call it what you will this is a fanatical ride.<br /><br />colin geddes, the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in japan. think of "lord of the rings" or "neverending story" for japan. after the screening i can understand where they were going with that, but damn this is "takashi miike" after all. he directed the '01 film "ichi the killer", when it screening at the festival barf bags were handed out at the screening. and no, that wasn't just a marketing ploy.<br /><br />plot summary: a young boy with a troubled home life becomes "chosen," and he stumbles into the middle of a great spirit war, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey.<br /><br />this is not really for kids, well not 'too' young. certainly see them getting scared shitless with some of these spirits (even the friendly ones) on display. this is unlike anything i've seen in the movie theater before. a fantasy naturally, some very funny (but dark) material. you will not be bored can guarantee that. will this ever hit north america? doubtful.<br /><br />my rating = b
