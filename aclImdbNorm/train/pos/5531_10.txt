watching "the fox and the child" was an intoxicating experience. the lush visuals, integrity of point of view, and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure.<br /><br />the plot is uncomplicated. deceptively simple. within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless.<br /><br />i laughed. i wept. i learned.<br /><br />this is a movie you can trust yourself to -- give yourself over to. dare i say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. it reaches to the heart of the viewer--of any age--and reveals the world through new eyes, as if seen from the heart.<br /><br />adi da samraj once said that true art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in reality. i feel i have been privileged to watch--no, to participate in--this film, a work of true art.
