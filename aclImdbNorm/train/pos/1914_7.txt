eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series. i love john ritter and his character paul hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show.<br /><br />i have always preferred kerry to bridget, bridget has been done before, kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways, although i'm not sure i like the direction her character went in later series.<br /><br />early episodes were fun, good simple teenage plots about paul and cate disciplining the kids, however i think the show lost it's sparkle when john ritter died. i admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died, i felt the programme did to. to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the '8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter' it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the hennessey dad.<br /><br />bridget seemed to get more annoying, rory stayed the same and cate was always giving her offspring life's lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to paul. i think the granddad is funny (especially when he's watching great escape) but feel c.j is unnecessary to the show. he is funny in parts but i felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series. over all the newer ones aren't bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that cate works at the school and c.j and granddad's always there too? i would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for paul and kerry, but later ones were about average at best.
