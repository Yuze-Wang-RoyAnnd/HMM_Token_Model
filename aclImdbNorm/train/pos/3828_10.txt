i would love to comment on this film. alas , my search has always endeth in vain. if any good citizen could help a desperate inhabitant of this ailing planet and restore his confidence in humanity by offering the whereabouts of either a uk vhs or loan him a dvd copy of the vhs; he would, without reservation, be eternally grateful..... <br /><br />blake wrote "the road to excess is the path to wisdom", one hopes my weary road of excess will offer the path to fruition .... if not, i will have to replay the excellent mr russel's gothic in the knowledge that those who have seen haunted summer (for better or for worse) have enriched their viewing pleasure of the events of july 1816 whilst i, a fellow member of this melodious plot, rests his lonely case in solitude ...
