i saw this when on the wonderful world of disney as a kid, so i didn't recall much of it. as i watched it recently, i sat there thinking, "this is the weirdest thing i've seen".<br /><br />the 'traveling' scenes look like something caused by an lsd overdose. the animated characters are mostly oddly colored/voiced versions of jungle book and robin hood characters. some not-so-disney things i noticed: kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutes(during the portobello road song).<br /><br />it was very entertaining, though the musical numbers were long and i can see little kids getting bored with them. also, the subject manner was a bit dark, seeing as it was set during ww2.
