nick nolte gives an excellent performance in kurt vonnegut's dark tale. notle plays howard w. campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during world war ii. after the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions wish to dig up his past. as with much of vonnegut's work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims. nolte is fantastic - self assured and confident as the younger campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past.
