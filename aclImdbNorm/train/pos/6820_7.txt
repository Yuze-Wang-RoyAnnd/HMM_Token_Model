the movie was much better than the other reviewer stated. it's a nice family movie. it has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel. the story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building. of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. she finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways. she is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run. it reminds me of a hallmark movie so give it a chance and decide for yourself. it seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6-12 years (maybe a bit older) and it's pretty much pg or g rated. i'm an adult who can appreciate a nice "family" movie - i guess the other reviewer isn't.
