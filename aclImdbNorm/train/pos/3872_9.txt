after you've seen this small likable and comical film, you will for sure feel better. cheer to yves b. pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment, that according to me, will be recognized as a marking movie of year 2004 for the quebec. the actors isabelle blais, emmanuel bilodeau, sylvie moreau and st'ephane gagnon all deliver a touching performance. i would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that le fabuleux destin d'am'elie poulain have given me. so if you've like the jean-pierre jeunet magnificent film, i would say that you should also like the first movie from yves b. pelletier, les aimants
