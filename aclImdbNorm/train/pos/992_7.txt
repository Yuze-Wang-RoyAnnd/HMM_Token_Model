i had no expectations; i'd never heard of jamie foxx; all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it. i thought it was highly entertaining; it was fun. the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest. to me, foxx is an original. david morse is terrific (true, this is not his finest role). i thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done. i didn't expect a lot and i was happily surprised.
