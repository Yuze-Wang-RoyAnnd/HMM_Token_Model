if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole-hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art. the actors and the direction of this film are both good. <br /><br />the only trouble with the film, as i can see it, is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond hollywood's capabilities at the time this film was shot.<br /><br />given both the irreverence of today's movies, as well as the willingness and abilityof today's audiences to delve into the bizarre, i think "even cowgirls... would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released.
