i'll be honest with you...i liked this movie. it's a great zombie flick that is packed with action, original ideas, good acting, but is also packed with bad zombie effects. part iv, entitled "after death" is also good. i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.<br /><br />10 out of 10<br /><br />fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, skinned alive, slumber party massacre, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.
