baseketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier,comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny,and a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers v.s the evil rich guy.the one and only thing i didnt like about baseketball,was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie,but,if the kid wasnt in the movie,some of the funny scenes wouldnt have existed.if you have read any pro reviews about this movie,exclude them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this film.baseketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 out of 10.
