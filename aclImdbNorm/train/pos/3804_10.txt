my 3 year old loved it. i loved it, my wife loved it. so 10 out of 10 from our family. as for violence level? not really that violent, mostly of the slap stick variety. nobody truly dies, no gore, no blood, no torture, so it certainly is appropriate for children, much more so than many saturday morning cartoons.<br /><br />this movie really takes the idea of cg movies where it should go.<br /><br />first of all beautiful graphics, textures wonderfully done, with true depth, not trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. the moss on the stones, the rust on metal, the reliefs on the wood and the stone, everything adds to the whole.<br /><br />character modeling, unlike many contemporary cg movies, is quirky, not cute, again within an artistic whole. the faces may look less malleable than in some other movies, but the characters are more puppet-like than human-like. i think that is a good thing, it lends veracity, how strangely it may sound, it is easier to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />hair, fur, clothing, on par, at least with the likes of pixar. just note in the opening scenes when lian-chu is fighting the giant slug; gwizdo is in front of some farmers, and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it.<br /><br />the setting. far beyond the likes of cars, and even wall
