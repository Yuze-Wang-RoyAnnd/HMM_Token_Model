i think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so i would just like to write about the impact this film had on me.<br /><br />i first saw this film the year of it's release around 1987. my school organised a trip to the cinema to see it, for an re project i think. we all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! little did we know what we were about to experience. to this day i still remember the feelings it invoked in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends. i think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet rightly outraged in our own youthful way .it had such an impact on me that i joined the anti apartheid movement the same year.<br /><br />i think it served it's purpose in my case.
