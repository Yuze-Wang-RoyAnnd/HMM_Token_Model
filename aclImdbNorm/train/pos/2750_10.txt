this is the kind of movie the us doesn't make. it's why people rent foreign films. it's a great story about how one person, even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty life. everybody can learn from georges. it also shows how people that are mentally challenged suffer in their life and shows them in a very realistic way (i think). as its classic in foreign films this movie has a bittersweet ending, but that only makes it a better movie.
