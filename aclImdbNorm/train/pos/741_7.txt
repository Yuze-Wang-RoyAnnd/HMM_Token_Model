i was just a bit young for this one, but i had to see it. there's some excellent music, which many folks have mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by "angel", a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit. wearing their trademark white outfits, they grind through "20th century foxes", and apparently all try to cram into the camera's field of vision. keyboardist gregg giuffria remains the bands highlight, and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut, ever! cherie currie (ex-runaways singer) begins a brief, but notable, acting career here, and is quite memorable alongside jodie foster, and the rest. (her topless 3-d scenes in "parasite", and her ufo sighting, in "wavelength" kept us all watching her for a time). <br /><br />it's not a masterpiece, but it preserves a chunk of its period, for all to gaze upon, and wonder.
