astaire and rogers at the height of their popularity. in 1936 americans thought of the navy as a place for song and dance. wwii was still a few years away. fred and ginger dance up the town.<br /><br />the plot is decent, but who cares... by the way, notice the cameo roles for betty grable and a glamorous lucile ball.<br /><br />a load of irving berlin songs, including the famous "let's face the music and dance". in that scene, ginger's heavy swooping dress smacks fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious. fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless.<br /><br />ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than fred, since she had to do all the same moves, in step, and backwards...<br /><br />come to think of it, fred's voice was nice too. the man was effortless in motion.<br /><br />here's a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved-one, kick off the shoes, and enjoy the entertainment.
