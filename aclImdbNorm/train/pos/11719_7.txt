elvira, mistress of the dark, is a fun, camp horror comedy, in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the navel. and the breasts of cassandra peterson become a character of their own.<br /><br />elvira (cassandra peterson) is stacked horror show hostess, who learns, that she has inherited her aunt morgana. so she goes to a little town of fallwell, which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth: morality comity. elviras boobacious appearance is, of course, too much for the prunes, but the kids of the town get a kick out of her different kind of approach on life. and of course there is even more sinister evil, her uncle vincent (william morgan sheppard), who is after elvira's mothers book of spells. see, elvira actually is a real witch, she just doesn't know it. yet.<br /><br />for what it is, elvira is quite funny film, even though the script does leave a lot of room for improvement. most laughs come from the difference between elvira and the people of good morals, but there are a couple of good visual gags as well. over all direction is okay, but it never rises to be anything more than that. in all, a good, intentionally campy, comedy. if you like this kind of thing, that is.
