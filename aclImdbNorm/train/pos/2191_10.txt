shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage. but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style. dan katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel aviv, but besides, katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the israeli people and, this people, far from being simple prominent figures, they speak to us from the heart. katzir's film allows israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live, and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes. it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel, which the europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers, appears as a close and absolutly human reality, the reality of million people who looking for his place, exploring the whole state, the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it. katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force, and these feelings cross our hearts. thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world.
