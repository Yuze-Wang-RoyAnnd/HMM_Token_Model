i've been impressed with chavez's stance against globalisation for sometime now, but it wasn't until i saw the film at the amsterdam documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved. this film tells the story of coup/conspiracy by venezuela's elite, the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments, to remove democratically elected president chavez, and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship. this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson to the rest of world ! i commend the people of venezuela for taking matter into their own hands, and saving their country from the likes of halliburton and the bush regime.
