i remember the original series vividly mostly due to it's unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter. kolchak was hard-bitten newsman from the ben hecht school of big-city reporting, and his gritty determination and wise-ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable. my personal fave was "the spanish moss murders" due to it's totally original storyline. a poor,troubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou country, takes part in a sleep research experiment, for the purpose of dream analysis. something goes inexplicably wrong, and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth. this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state, and brutally suffocates them to death. kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth, much to the chagrin of police captain joe "mad dog" siska(wonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynn)and the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder, severn darden, to droll, understated perfection. the wickedly funny, harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system, and is a series highlight. kolchak never got any better. timeless.
