mel torme and victor borge, in their younger years, serve to make this film interesting - and especially viewing a young sinatra, on the sunny side of 30, and definitely conveying that this was his "yes, i'm a popular singer, but hardly an actor yet" stage. michele morgan is an annoying, inane presence, and jack haley is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost on me. leon erroll is silly, as always, but overall pretty funny. 7 stars of a potential 10 is about the right "grade," because with the combination of its positive aspects, along with the lack of much of a story, and a silly one at that, and the fore-mentioned annoyances - it is overall average at best. most of the fascination is from the viewing of the three entertainment icons in their early years.
