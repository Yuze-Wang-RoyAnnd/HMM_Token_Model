this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic. <br /><br />i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the neil gaiman novel which i am now looking to read) and colorful characters.<br /><br />one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is. unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale, satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel.<br /><br />original. fun. feel-good fantasy.
