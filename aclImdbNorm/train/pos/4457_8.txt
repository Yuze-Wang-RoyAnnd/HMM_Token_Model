yes, this is one of the great musical movies i grew up with with such great entertainers as frank sinatra and gene kelly, not to mention the petite and glorious voice of kathryn grayson. the music and dancing is superb. i understand frank took lessons from kelly; and there is kelly dancing with jerry mouse, which is quite unique for the time. betty garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with sinatra. she is one of hollywood's great underrated stars. i saw this again on a&e tv and as well have it in my old vcr tapes. never get tired of these old musicals. whatever happened to hollywood??
