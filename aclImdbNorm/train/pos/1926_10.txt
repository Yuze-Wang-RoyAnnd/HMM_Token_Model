in 1967 i visited the lake elsinore glider-port and flew a yellow pratt read sailplane. returning to germany the above serious ran on tv and one segment was about the high altitude sailplane flights in california in the early 50ies. (the real life pilot was bill ivans, i don't know who played him in the series) it turned out that the sailplane in the film was the same (same n-number) as the one i had flown at lake elsinore. ever since i saw that segment i have been searching for it and have been wondering if it is somewhere available. (other segments in that serious were about the baker ejection seat; an instrument to find avalanche victims etc.
