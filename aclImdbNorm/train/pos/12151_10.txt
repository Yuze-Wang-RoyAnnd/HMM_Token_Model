this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be. it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in grad school that we stumbled upon this. the cheesy acting. the poorly written script. the good ol' boys. the ridiculous, yet somehow obvious, clich'e, and banal premise. the riding in pickup trucks with your propped-up wife-corpse. it has it all.<br /><br />you will meet familiar characters: gold-digging hussy, stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own, friends-who-know-better, daddy who knows better but drives son away. and the wife-corpse. propped up. in a pick-up. <br /><br />wow: and the title. several things in our lives have been "texas tragedies" since watching this beauty. everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal.
