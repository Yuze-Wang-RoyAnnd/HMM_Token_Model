i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn't know about this website and i didn't realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show. for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can't tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt. the episode where starsky (kill starsky) almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show. what to you expect of a kid at age 12. now, i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i'm so there!!!!!!!! just got to say happy birthday paul!!!!!
