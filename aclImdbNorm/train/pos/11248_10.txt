illudere (to delude) comes from latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet i feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, i was able to finish the book it was a revelation! at the beginning i was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing (i really started to love le carre after that novel). the main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? after this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of green's 'our man in havana' wrote by lecarre with 'the tailor of panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. there is no smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. the bbc has done a superb work with these series from lecarre's novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is brilliantly adapted. be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste is bitter.
