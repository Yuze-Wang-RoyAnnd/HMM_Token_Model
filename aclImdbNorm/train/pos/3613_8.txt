when "girlfight" came out, the reviews praised it, but i didn't get around to seeing it. i finally saw it when it got released on video, and understand the glowing reviews.<br /><br />the movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. we quickly get introduced to student diana guzman (michelle rodriguez). she has a bad-ass expression on her face, and any idea about diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight. as diana gets in trouble for this, we then meet her father, an aggressive type in his own right; clearly we can't totally blame diana for her attitude.<br /><br />but then the movie really picks up, as a new thought germinates in diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this grim existence. her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely won't approve. only diana herself can decide what to do.<br /><br />just the first few minutes alone identified that i was in for a very gritty, non-hollywood movie, but the brief appearance of john sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that. even before they get to any boxing scenes, you feel like you're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that diana lives. and when they finally arrive at the film's main story, there's no turning back.<br /><br />all in all, i definitely recommend this movie. i will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself/herself has been sort of a clich'e in cinema for many years ("rocky", "million dollar baby"), but i still think that they did a great job with it here. in fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. really good. too bad that michelle rodriguez wasted herself in hollywood movies after this one.
