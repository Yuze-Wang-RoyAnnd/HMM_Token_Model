as others have commented, i checked this out after siskel and ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year. what a gift. i then went out to buy it, just so that i could loan it out.<br /><br />best quote? dwight yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (cage) is on top of his cab. when cage peers down, he apologizes. "i'm sorry if i scared you." yoakum thrusts his pistol in cage's face with "does this look like i'm scared?" great bit of humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape.<br /><br />there really was a sense of fun to this. the constant sighting of the "welcome to red rock" sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake. the music created a hunting, eerie quality to the film reminiscent of "twin peaks". unlike "twin peaks", though, it doesn't spoil things by going too far into the outlandish, needing to "top" itself.<br /><br />i admit watching the credits 15-20 times. you see, they had yoakum's "thousand miles from nowhere" (perfectly chosen) playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor . . with snow-capped mountains in the distance. this was incredible, fluid framing. further, i've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film. also, it totally fit the story.
