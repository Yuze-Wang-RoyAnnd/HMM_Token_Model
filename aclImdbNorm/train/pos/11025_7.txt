cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director renny harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the rocky mountains. sylvester stallone is impressive as gabe walker the expert climber especially in the action/fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. for the sake of the film though i willing to suspend my disbelief. the rest of the cast including john lithgow, michael rooker, janine turner, rex linn, caroline goodall, and leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie. the action/fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are. the climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie. the deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable. the villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. the pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one. if you're a big fan of harlins or stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. overall cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, some suspense, excitement, thrills, and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.
