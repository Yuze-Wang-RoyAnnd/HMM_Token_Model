it's very very funny. you know, just like a comedy is supposed to be. it also looks very very good, like a hollywood spectacular should. so, what more do you want? howz about a very very good sally fields. she is so much better here than in anything else i've ever seen her in, and she looks so damn good. this movie is all you need to understand why she's a star. those eyes! like a silent movie star, but better. in fact, everyone's eyes are so good. i used to pretend to be a bad tv soap actor with my girlfriend. we'd do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner. they don't do that at all in soap dish. great. the eyes have it! (sorry) <br /><br />there's so many terrific performances, its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear. there's a whole workshop going on with kevin kline on how to overact very very subtly. got that? yeah, he's damn good. so is robert downey, jr. who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the slick, slimy executive. cathy moriarity, while not the most gifted actress, is so charismatic and riveting, especially when she's angry. and even whoopi goldberg is decent, her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little zing. ok, no whoopi bashing, i hear ya.<br /><br />and then, there's the hair. soap dish was made at the end of the big hair eighties, so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves. they get bigger and sillier, just like your's did. yeah, we got pictures.<br /><br />soap dish is better than i thought it'd be, better that i wanted it to be. i'm sick of movies that tell me i'm supposed to care about shallow, self centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie. tv soap actors. soap dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em. thank you.
