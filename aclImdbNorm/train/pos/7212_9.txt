i would not hesitate to put this adaptation of 'death trap" in a top 5 list of the best stage-to-movie adaptations ever. caine and reeves (an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than soggy romances and "superman") play off each other extremely well here. even dyan cannon - who i normally don't care for - is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actress.<br /><br />i'm not sure that comparisons of "deathtrap" with "sleuth" - another brilliant stage-to-screen adaptation featuring michael caine - are valid, or even fair. yes, the two stories have a lot in common. but "sleuth" is as much about class warfare as the battle of wits, and the house in "sleuth" is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors - the house doesn't really have an equivalent in "deathtrap". and "deathtrap" isn't so much a battle of wits as it is a pointed vignette about how people are no damned good (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get. i'll just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre, and well worth your time and money. this is america, after all. you don't have to choose! <br /><br />i won't give away the twists and turns of the plot, but i don't think it matters anyway. i've watched the dvd eight or nine times in a dozen years, and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean, scary moments when things go "all pear shaped". it's all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destination.<br /><br />anyone who likes black-hearted comedy and suspense in the hitchcock style of film-making will probably enjoy "deathtrap" immensely.
