talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - peter ustinov and maggie smith - together - in "hot millions," a funny, quirky comedy also starring karl malden, robert morley, and bob newhart. ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (morley) and takes a position in a firm run by malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. it's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by newhart, and his neighbor, maggie smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. she can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. when newhart makes advances to her, she invites ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. of course, she doesn't know ustinov is a crook.<br /><br />this is such a good movie - you can't help but love ustinov and smith and be fascinated by ustinov's machinations, his genius, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. but there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains. don't miss this movie, set in '60s london. it's worth if it only to hear maggie smith whine, "i've been sacked."
