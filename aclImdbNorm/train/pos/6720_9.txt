riding giants<br /><br />this documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and acclaimed surfer films, dana brown's endless summer, its follow-up endless summer ii by bruce brown, dana's son, and step into liquid (imax). i saw the first, not the others. <br /><br />while the surfing footage is spectacular, i valued most the film-maker's historic perspective. he takes us back to the sport's origins almost a hundred years ago, and shows how it evolved to its present form. this includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers, how surfboard designs changed over time, which beaches in hawaii and california were most frequented by the world-class surfers, and what an incredible adrenalin rush the sport provided them. the athletes lived for months at a time on beaches, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary bunks, fished for food, and went back out on their boards the next day. what a euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /><br />we see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start. what was the biggest boost to the sport? believe it or not, it was the movie gidget, although i suspect copyright issues may prevent crediting the beachboys' surfing songs like surfer girl and surfing usa. the surfing magazine and encyclopedia of surfing (who knew there was such a tome) are mentioned for their contributions. we also see commentaries from the pioneers of the sport, their families, and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s. one such story is how 40-year old laird hamilton, considered today's greatest surfer, bonded with an earlier leading surfer, introduced him to his single mom, who he married before becoming his step-dad. <br /><br />a rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story. have i whetted your appetite? wonderful. have a great ride.
