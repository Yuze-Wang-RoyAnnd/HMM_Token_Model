when i learned of sir alec guinness' death, this was the first of his many films i thought of re-seeing. what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years. and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame. his eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears. both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites.
