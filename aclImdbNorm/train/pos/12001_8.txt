i don't know what movie some of these other people watched, but they must have seen a different "joseph smith: prophet of the restoration" than the one i saw.<br /><br />i think the movie was both well-done and inspiring. i think it's definitely worth watching. it's apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film. the background scenery is beautiful.<br /><br />i think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a prophet. joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence.<br /><br />i would definitely recommend watching this movie.
