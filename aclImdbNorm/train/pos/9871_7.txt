return to the lost world was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of the lost world.<br /><br />in this sequel, the same five people, lead by challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land. gomez has something to do with this. they manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved, much to the delight of the natives.<br /><br />like in the lost world, what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a t-rex and ankylosaurus.<br /><br />john ryhs-davies and david warner reprise their roles as challenger and summerlee and three of the other actors are also back.<br /><br />despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs, i enjoyed return to the lost world.<br /><br />rating: 3 stars out of 5.
