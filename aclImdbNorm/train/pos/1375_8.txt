in this swimming pool, this pond, there are water lilies and there are frogs. frogs sit on water lilies. the frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship. marie(pauline acquart) is a water lily, a synchronized swimming groupie with a crush on floraine(adele haenel), a frog, the captain of her team. floraine's teammates shun their leader because the preternaturally curvy and well-proportioned blonde conveys a loose persona that betrays the syncrhronized swimmer's mindset of conformity and discipline. but floraine has a secret; the bombshell has a bombshell, which "naissance des pieuvres" reveals to the audience, visually, before she confides in marie.<br /><br />floraine has never gone, as they say, all the way, with a boy.<br /><br />at a party, we see a double-image of the burgeoning sex bomb checking her make-up in a bathroom mirror. "lolita" is a fata morgana. marie gets to know floraine's double while her imitation breaks the water lily's heart. while the frog goes through the motions of catching flies for appearance's sake, she gets chummy with the water lily when no one's looking. in the film's most startling scene, the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation. floraine wants boys to like her, but she doesn't like boys, seemingly, but it's more important to the frog that she's popular. when the water lily finally kisses the frog, the frog remains a frog. the frog can't transform into a water lily, or a princess, because the water lily lost the frog's respect. after their lips unlock, floraine tells marie, "see, it's easy," which is the frog's way of equating their kiss with the orgasm that her friend gave her as nothing more than a rite-of-passage without any strings attached. floraine's beauty is a burden. she carries the weight of meeting boy's expectations. florence uses marie to have one final fling before her fata morgana subjugates its imitation into the closet.<br /><br />the other water lily, the other frog, marie's best friend anne(louise blachere) and floraine's frustrated boy-toy francois(warren jacobs), just like any water lily and frog, have a parasitic relationship, too. while floraine uses marie for love, francois uses anne for sex. but that's life; that's the treachery of growing up, in which even a friend will turn on a good friend if the opportunity to move up the food chain presents itself. at a mcdonalds, the water lily chastises the other water lily after bathing extensively in the frog's afterglow. physical beauty is a currency. marie gets to call the shots because anne, although far from being ugly, is overweight and has an unflattering hairdo. anne tries to fight back by using her breasts as ample retaliation(the magnifying glass from her happy meal incidentally comments on marie's flat chest), but the tadpole(marie thinks she's better than anne, better than a water lily) points out that her breasts are a byproduct of fat. <br /><br />teenaged girls can be brutal to each other.<br /><br />later, in the final shot, "naissance des pieuvres" suggests that marie has a double, too, and this symbiosis among water lilies has the potential to turn parasitic in the near-future, if it not already has. teenaged girls can be brutal to each other in a way that no boy could match.
