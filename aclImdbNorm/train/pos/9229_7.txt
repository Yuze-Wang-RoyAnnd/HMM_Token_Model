"flavia, la monaca muslmana" aka. "flavia the heretic" of 1974 is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of italian exploitation cinema that, to a certain extent, follows a somewhat feminist premise (though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists). set mostly in a convent, and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist (great performance by the wonderful florinda bolkan), "flavia the heretic" may be referred to as a 'nunsploitation' film. however, this film differs quite drastically from the typical nunsploitation flicks from the time, as it doesn't so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism, sadistic lesbian punishments, etc. personally, i saw more similarities to the hexploitation flicks of the time, such as "mark of the devil", (even though this one doesn't treat the topic of witch-hunts), which focus on the brutal execution of christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period.<br /><br />italy around 1600: after witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded muslim soldier, young flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent. when her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later, falvia's disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church, and she joins a band of arabic scavengers...<br /><br />one thing is for sure, "flavia the heretic" is not for the faint-hearted, and neither is it for those who want happy endings. director gianfranco mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible, especially in its nasty scenes. the many torture- and execution-scenes are extremely disturbing, with skinnings, spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail, the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film. the violence here is never superfluous, however. after all, this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in. the film is very well-made, with realistic costumes, fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by nicola piovani. the stunningly beautiful and great florinda bolkan has proved her talent in many great italian cult-productions (including lucio fulci's giallo-masterpiece "non si sevizia un paperino" of 1972). she delivers another great, charismatic performance here, and i couldn't imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does. the film has some minor inconsistencies (e.g. why does the rigid church let bizarre cult-followers into convents in the first place). however, it is overall amazing how realistic this film is. "flavia the heretic" should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of italian exploitation cinema. this is a great exploitation flick overall, though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood. highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema. 7.5/10
