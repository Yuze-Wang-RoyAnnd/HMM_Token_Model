i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago. then, the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional, if indeed they could ever transpire at all. not any longer. now, the politics, society, and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed.<br /><br />consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year the running man came out) that are present today:<br /><br />concern with, as richard dawson's character damon killian puts it, "traditional morality." check<br /><br />entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear, and discomfort on the part of contestants. check<br /><br />cameras everywhere. check<br /><br />restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports ("travel passes" in the movie) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. check<br /><br />an increased intermingling, bordering on incestuous, of government and media. check<br /><br />computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage (such as the "digital matting" of ben richards' image onto the stunt double). check<br /><br />jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. check<br /><br />flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not-so-wealthy; increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government; civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent. check, check, check<br /><br />then again, maybe it's just a movie based on a stephen king novella. but just to be safe, i'm moving to switzerland.
