being from the philadelphia suburbs and extremely interested in local history, this film provides an excellent vintage view of philadelphia in the 1940s. there are scenes of downtown, a train station that no longer exists, 30th street station--which still does exist, as well as scenes from the northeast part of the city. good shots of the old row-homes as they appeared then. the movie gets a bit "chatty" at times - causing the viewer to briefly lose interest...but the overall storyline is solid and very moving. anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film "bright victory", also with local footage of the valley forge army hospital in phoenixville, pa - and scenes from downtown phoenixville. the army hospital has since become a college campus. neither of these films are out on any format and i can't imagine why. i have them both on vhs from home recording, as shown on tcm in recent years. i highly recommend them to any other history buffs out there from my area!
