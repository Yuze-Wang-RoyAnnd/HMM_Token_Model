a prequel to the re-imagined battlestar galactica series, from the same creative team ronald d. moore and david eick as well as new series co-creator remi aubuchon. caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of battlestar galactica. the new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the cylon race.<br /><br />the pilot and the series are set to follow two families; the graystone's which include daniel (eric stoltz) a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter zoe (alessandra toreson), while the adama's include joseph (esai morales) a lawyer and his son william the future admiral of battlestar galactica.<br /><br />like battlestar galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in eric stoltz, esai morales and polly walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including alessandra toreson and magda apanowicz.<br /><br />for fans of battlestar gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different. in the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series. the scenes on caprica while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have retro feel, this is achieved through some of the architecture, the costumes and the way it is shot.<br /><br />while the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar, religion is again very important here, while the racial theme rarely touched on in bg is far more important. we also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one, as well as issues related to crime and government.<br /><br />the pilot has been released direct to dvd in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on tv, the series is set to start in 2010.<br /><br />like battlestar galactica this series is filmed in vancouver
