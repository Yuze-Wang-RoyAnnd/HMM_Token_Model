shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over. i just wonder how that came to be made. there were too many scenes in this movie that i wondered about how come a camera was there. if the scenes shot where the warhols descended on a bjm post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max, if not, then it was a total fabrication, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? all the way thru this movie i kept wondering how the footage came about. taken at face value, a nice portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe ourselves to be.
