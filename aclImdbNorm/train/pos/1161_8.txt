it was extremely low budget(it some scenes it looks like they recorded with a home video recorder). however it does have a good plot line, and its easy to follow. 8 years after shooting her sexually abusive step father amanda is released from the psychiatric ward, with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with. the doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car. but within the first 20 minutes of the movie amanda kills him and buries him in her backyard. then she see's her neighbor richard sets eyes on him and stops at nothing until she has him. she acts innocent but after another neighbor buzz finds out that amanda killed that doctor and attempted to kill richards wife laurie (this is after amanda and him get it on in the hot tub). then she stops acting so innocent and kills buzz and later on attempts to kill richard whom she supposedly loves and cares for. and you'll have to rent the movie to find out if amanda dies or not. overall good movie, reminds me a lot of my life you know the whole falling for the neighbor and stopping at nothing until you have him part.
