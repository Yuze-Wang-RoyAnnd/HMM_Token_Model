this is one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />if the movie has a flaw, it's that it comes at you like a raging bull. it doesn't so much engage the viewer as assault him. ''scarface'' is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself. nothing is left to the viewer's imagination.<br /><br />moroder's languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee. like the chorus in a greek tragedy, it wails and gnashes, broods and tugs, a constant reminder of tony's inexorable fate.<br /><br />not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress, ''scarface'' rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.
