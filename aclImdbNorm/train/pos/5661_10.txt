i see a lot of folks on this site wishing ag would come out on dvd. well, i bought it on dvd. (from borders, no less!) while it is great to have this terrific show in a boxed dvd form, i am upset by the fact that they added very few in the way of "extra's" (a director commentary from shaun cassidy on the pilot episode) and the episodes are shown in the same order they were put out on tv. the missing episodes that were never shown prior to being run on sci fi channel are in the box set, but are tacked on the final dvd. if you buy the dvd set, get the actual order they are to be viewed and you will be happier. (you will need to swap dvd's in and out of your player to see them in order, but you will be glad you did.)<br /><br />s
