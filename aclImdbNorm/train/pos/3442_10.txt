this movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story. i too cannot understand why people would trash this movie.<br /><br />if you are a jerry bruckheimer fan, this movie may not suitable for u.<br /><br />this movie presents high degree of realism. the actors and actresses' performance is examplary. not fake, just natural. <br /><br />no special sound.effects, so special side effects.<br /><br />the camera work is excellent, the music is oh so good. i can't wait to get the soundtrack.<br /><br />it leaves your body numb, like constant garderner.the directly has raw talent, certainly not a follower.
