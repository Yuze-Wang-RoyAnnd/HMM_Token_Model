kate beckinsale steals the show! bravo! too bad knightly ins't as good looking as jeremy northam. mark strong did a fabulous job. bernard hepton was perfect as emmas father. i love the end scene (which is an addition to the novel-but well written) when the harvest is in and knightly dines with his workers and high society friends. emma must show that she accepts this now. she is a changed woman. that is too much too quick, but ok. i'll buy into it. samantha bond plays emma's ex-governess and confidant. she is wonderful. just as i would have imagined her. i believe that when the uk does a jane austen its the best. american versions of english literature are done for money and not for quality. see this one!
