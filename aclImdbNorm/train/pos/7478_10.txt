i'm from romania i'll try to speak in english. all i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one. seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now. it has all the little things i like in a movie , it's very touching makes me cry . shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality , and the true things that matter for different people. it so happens that for me this matters the most , the love , the soul of a man , he's inner being, and this i see in this movie. perhaps for me it's much more than a motion picture , it's a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate. it's a long way from reality to sci-fi , but .. what if. what if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down , would fall? we would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that , on your death bed , the bigger thing you remember , is not the wealth , not the adventure , not the countries you visited and the people that remember you. but the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die , all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more. watch this movie and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me :) hail from romania
