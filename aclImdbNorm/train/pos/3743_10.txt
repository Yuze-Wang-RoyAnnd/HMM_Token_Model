tight script, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of locations....<br /><br />paul mcgann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.<br /><br />there is an interesting moral & emotional journey happening with his character (ben turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by amanda burton. inevitably they cross over... who has done what?<br /><br />the examination of why, both in the past and in the present, rather than who might have yielded a more interesting, dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's complaining?<br /><br />
