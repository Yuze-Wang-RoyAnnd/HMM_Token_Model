i could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in gundam wing, they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts. instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss.<br /><br />it contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months... years, and then go back to and derive new meaning from, a masterpiece in script writing (even though it has the typical anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and english dub). it has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views.<br /><br />the relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series. the relationship between heero and relena, and milliardo and noin are joys to watch. the apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment. the women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely, if at all see, which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic. it takes heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring, but he gets there, and when he does, its a big pay off. <br /><br />and then there's the giant robot fighting. fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any hollywood epic fight scene. any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids, as has become clear when i'm trying to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. many of the giant robot fights in gundam wing contain a hefty dose of pathos, usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete.<br /><br />the constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes gundam wing impossible to be boring, it is a captivating, thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body.
