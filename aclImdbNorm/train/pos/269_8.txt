i'm a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones. the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i didn't see coming before each commercial. to me it was kind of like medium meets csi.<br /><br />did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman? are they related in any way? i'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video.<br /><br />dedee was great. haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincingly.<br /><br />if you're into to tv mystery movies, check this one out if you have a chance.
