one of the best movies i ever saw was an irish movie titled philadelphia,here i come. i read the play before i saw the movie and loved them both. it's the story of a young man preparing to leave ireland to go to america because he can't earn a living in ireland. it is told both from the perspective of the young man(whom the other characters in the film can see) and another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings., but who cannot be seen by the other characters in the film. it is a very sad movie, but deeply touching, and i would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about. i love any irish movie, or almost any movie about ireland, and any film that has the late irish actor donal mccann in it gets my vote.i would watch that man chew gum for 2 hours on screen, and unfortunately,i have.terrible shame to have lost him so young.
