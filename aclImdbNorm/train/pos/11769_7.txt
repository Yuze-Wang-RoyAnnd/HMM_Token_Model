i bought this movie a few days ago, and thought that it would be a pretty shitty film. but when i popped it into the dvd-player, it surprised me in a very good way. james belushi plays very well as bill "the mouth" manuccie. but especially timothy dalton plays a very good roll as the sheriff. the 'end' scene, in the house of bill is very excellent, good camera-work, nice dialogues and very good acting. bill "the mouth" manuccie has stolen 12 million dollars from the mafia. together with his wife he lives in south-carolina in a witness protection program. but the mafia tracks him down, and wants the 12 million dollar. bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out, himself.
