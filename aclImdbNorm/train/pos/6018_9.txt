i saw this in the early 70s (when i was 16), and despite the long slow set-up, meetings, riots, etc, once the desert section began all fell into context and i loved it. (still do, it has aged very well.) back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority. all criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. happily i'm no longer in such a minority. <br /><br />it deftly shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political splintering, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialisation and deception which lay ahead.<br /><br />appreciation for this magistral film has grown, and i'm glad about that.
