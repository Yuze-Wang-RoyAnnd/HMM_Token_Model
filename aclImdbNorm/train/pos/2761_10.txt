i saw this film first on my way home from paris to newark aboard air france in august 1996. the film itself i believe is quite a masterpiece. it's the kind of film that people should be making. i still think daniel auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. in this french film, he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a down syndrome man who lives in an institution with other down syndrome patients. the actors including the actor who actually has down syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. daniel's life and ours changes forever with the down syndrome man. he realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about. the ending is kind of silly though but i still think it's one of my favorite movies. it's enough to bring a tear to your eye.
