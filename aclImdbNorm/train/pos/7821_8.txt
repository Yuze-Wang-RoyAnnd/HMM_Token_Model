very rarely does denzil washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for kevin kline and in this case , this must count as one of their best films. it is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of steve biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend donald woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt , putrid society south africa was. the direction is outstanding from david attenborough as it was for gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film. two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie .what is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras. thousands of people in both films. this film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of aparthiet and you cannot fail to moved by it. 8 out of 10.
