i first caught the movie on its first run on hbo in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old i thought the movie was hilarious. i remember not seeing the alfred e. neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. when mad magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the "usual gang" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, i just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which i'm sure they were, but to seriously find them ( and ron liebman ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, i was quite surprised. surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the mad references restored, i still get a kick out of it. and being a ron liebman fan (hot rock, where's poppa?) i think it's his crown jewel of performances (say it agaaaain)
