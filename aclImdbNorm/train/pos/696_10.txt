surprisingly well done for an independent film, an insomniac's nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. wonderfully well written, and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniac.<br /><br />starring dominic monaghan as jack, we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on. the narration is almost hypnotizing, and from the opening lines, it is impossible to turn away. fascinating and slightly disturbing, it shows how someone copes with a lack of sleep, balancing on the brink between sanity and madness.<br /><br />with twists and turns around every corner, an insomniac's nightmare is provocative and engaging. it comes very highly recommended.
