after all the crap that hollywood (and the indies) have churned out, we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments. there are some clich'ed moments, but i'm not sure it's possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie. there's not much new here...it's just done well.<br /><br />make sure and pay attention, as the "subtle" scares come quickly and often. this is not a movie to watch while you're eating pizza.<br /><br />there's one very well-written red herring in this movie and, unfortunately, one very poorly-cast role. cheri christian just doesn't make an effective julie (the wife/mother). for one thing, she's totally unsympathetic. i know, i know...she's just gone through a traumatic experience. but the viewer never gets to know her as she "normally" is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting (in an unintentional way). i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her, but i never did.<br /><br />finally, a thumbs-up for the ending, which is both disturbing and satisfying. it could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits, but the director wisely resisted.<br /><br />this is not a masterpiece by any means, but it is a good, old-fashioned scary movie...something that's rather rare nowadays.
