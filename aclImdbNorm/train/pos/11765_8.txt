this movie surprised me, it had good one-liners and laughs, + a nonstop action-packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions. this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns. the plot is solid despite what others may think, it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end. in conclusion; this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on.
