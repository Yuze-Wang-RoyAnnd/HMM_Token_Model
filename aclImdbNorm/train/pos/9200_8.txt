i've read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne, when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade-like game with a desire to rip-off the max payne style (not just bullet-time). so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is! and how different from "max payne", yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game-style. this game is non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up, so much fun, as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne, the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a bit more of that "bullet-time" you should definitely own this game.
