i used this film in a religion class i was teaching. the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment. a young boy and his mother are away from home. the boy has been given money to buy milk. on the way home, he stops at carnival to play a game. next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary. the boy drops the bottle of milk. it breaks. the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. this scene alternates with what is happening at home. a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment. he(?) discovers the fish bowl and watches it. the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl. by now, a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish. the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath. the cat drops the fish into the bowl. the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat. both inspire prejudice. both are innocent. it was a great discussion starter in my class.
