on the 28th of december, 1895, in the grand caf'e in paris, film history was writing itself while louis lumi`ere showed his short films, all single shots, to a paying audience. 'la sortie des usines lumi`ere' was the first film to be played and i wish i was there, not only to see the film, but also the reactions of the audience.<br /><br />we start with closed doors of the lumi`ere factory. apparently, since the image seems a photograph, people thought they were just going to see a slide show, not something they were hoping for. but then the doors open and people are streaming out, heading home. first a lot of women, then some men, and one man on a bike with a big dog. when they are all out the doors close again.<br /><br />whether this is the first film or not (some say 'l'arriv'ee d'un train `a la ciotat' was the first film lumi`ere recorded), it is an impressive piece of early cinema. being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons. one simple reason: it is only fifty seconds long. but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here; you don't get to see historical things like this every day.
