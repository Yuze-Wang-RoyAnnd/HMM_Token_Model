i have recently seen this movie due to jake's recent success with brokeback mountain. i figured i would see the movies that i missed. i had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that i had missed this movie at all. it's a gripping father and son tale, and it is also an underdog story. i even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale. this movie appeals to all ages. the only reason i give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle, but it comes back strong in the end. the acting was great, the story was magnificent, and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film. go see this movie! rent it, buy it, watch it, love it! i know i did!
