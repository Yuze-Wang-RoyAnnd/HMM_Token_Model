i went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film. what i got was scare after scare. it's a horror film at it's core. it's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore. this film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters. i think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house. they become haunted no matter where they are. office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms... etc. after reading some of the external reviews i am really surprised that critics didn't like this film. i am going to see it again this week and am excited about it.<br /><br />i gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should. it scared the s**t out of me.
