another detailed work on the subject by dr dwivedi takes us back in time to pre-partioned panjab. dr dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his movie debut. he has worked on all meticulous details to bring the story to life. the treatment of the subject is very delicate.<br /><br />even though we have not been to the region during that time, the sets and costumes look real. unlike most movies made on partition, this one focuses not on the gory details of violence to attract audience, but on its after-effects. the characters come to life. priyanshu chatterjee has given an impressive performance. manoj bajpai has acted his heart out showing the plight of a guilt-ridden man. the rest of the cast has done a good job too.
