when i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film - it clearly wasn't a reference to british currency, so it had to be shakespearian and about pounds of flesh - taking them, or giving them. will smith's a feelgood actor, so serial killers were out. it could only be about a man giving them, so must be about guilt somehow. i spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched, as the beauty of the build-up is the way parts of the main character's background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doing.<br /><br />guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because it's deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a roller-coaster ride - you know its going to be unpleasant. i wouldn't say the movie glorifies suicide; it delves into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom.<br /><br />it's also brimming with symbolism everywhere, which is a surefire tell-tale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature. the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could. determined to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - what a 2nd act complication. absolutely masterful.<br /><br />yes it is very slow-paced, but i'm undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe. i didn't feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have, but maybe that's just me having ruined it for myself beforehand. saying all that though, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get.
