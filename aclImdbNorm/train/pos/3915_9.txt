i've seen this film at least 4 times since '84 and it's still great every time i see it. it's a very compelling version of the opera carmen, with amazing flamenco dancing, bare bones sets, and, of course, wonderful music.<br /><br />this telling of carmen is a story within a story, with each paralleling the other, until the doubly tragic ending. obviously a low budget spanish production, the film contains dancing by some of spain's premier flamenco dancers. the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage, makes the telling of the story even more powerful.<br /><br />it's independent movie making at it's best and probably my all time favorite foreign film.
