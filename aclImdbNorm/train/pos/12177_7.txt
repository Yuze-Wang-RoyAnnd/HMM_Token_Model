recap: the morning after his bachelor party paul is woken by his mother-in-law-to-be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him. unfortunately its a waitress from the bar, and not his fianc'ee. and suddenly she turns up everywhere... the toll booth at the freeway and at his parent-in-laws dinner. and it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-boyfriend had him followed and photographed. it is not only about saving his wedding... it is about survival.<br /><br />comments: actually much better than expected. not the sweet romantic comedy i expected, but something much funnier, something with a little edge. this movie wasn't afraid to take the jokes a little further. and jason lee does now how to deliver comedy, especially when his character is half-panicked and deep in trouble, as he is here. and he got nice support from beautiful ladies julia stiles and selma blair. and actually i thought lochlyn munro did a nice part as the ex.<br /><br />so, more emphasis on comedy than romance, and the end result was good. i enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />7/10
