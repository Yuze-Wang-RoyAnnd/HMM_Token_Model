there are so many good things to say about this "b" movie.<br /><br />"b' maybe in connections, but not in commission. this is about the best of its genre that i have ever seen. a grade a effort by universal. the script is well done, imaginative, and without fault. writing credits: howard higgin original story & douglas hodges story, john colton (screenplay). director lambert hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well. no skimping on the loads of extras and locations. i loved beulah bondy (jimmy stewarts mother in "it's a wonderful life". the fem lead, frances drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her karloff husband. lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed. i think this is the best part i remember seeing him in. as i said there were so many good things: the african discovery of the radium "x", the melting of the stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the ten little indians in and then there were none (agatha christie) (the barry fitzgerald version)), the glowing of karlof in the dark. karloff's mother played by violet kemble cooper with elegance. and because of all these virtues, i found myself believing in the science it portrayed. i guess that's the mark of a good piece of art.
