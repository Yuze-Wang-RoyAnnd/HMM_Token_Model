this is possibly the best short crime drama i've ever seen. the acting is superb especially amanda burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...she does an amazing job balancing rachels/carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama. the other actors are of course great too which they usually are in british tv/film. the ending,which i'm not going to give away,is fantastic mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll get what i mean after you've seen it) this is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you're not touched by this you're one cold hearted person.
