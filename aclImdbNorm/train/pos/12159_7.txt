- after their sons are sentenced to life in prison, adelle (debbie reynolds) and helen (shirley winters) begin receiving threatening phone calls because someone fells their sons got off easy. the pair decides to move to california to escape the publicity of the trial and to start a new life. they start a dance school that is soon very successful. one of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom adelle quickly falls in love. in the meantime, helen is busy raising rabbits and becoming a little too infatuated with an evangelist on the radio. it's only a mater of time before everything falls apart and the women enter a world of madness and murder.<br /><br />- i can't help but compare what's the matter with helen? to whoever slew auntie roo?, also starring shelly winters. where that movie seemed almost restrained in its presentation of auntie roo's madness, there's nothing holding helen back in this movie. it may take a good deal of the movie's running time, but once she snaps, helen is one bad mad mutha. you don't want to mess with her. winters is so delightfully demented that it was impossible for me not to enjoy her performance. i'm not going to spoil the movie, but the things helen is capable of are totally over-the-top.<br /><br />- as good as winters is, reynolds is totally ridiculous in her role as the gold-digging tap dancer. i got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would get her nominated for some award. this ain't citizen kane! quit acting so serious. hey, debbie, don't you realize that you're main purpose is to be a victim of winters' insanity.<br /><br />- i just love these former-female-stars-in-the-twilight-of-their-career horror movies. what's the matter with helen? is as fun as any.
