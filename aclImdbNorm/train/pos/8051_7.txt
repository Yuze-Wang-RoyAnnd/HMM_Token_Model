"one of hung's better early efforts. the humor is dead-on in parts as hung tries to imitate lee's moves and facial expressions, and also in a bit where hung pokes fun at jackie chan's drunken master. the action is also pretty good, especially when hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end. it's not the greatest film, but pretty good for '70's kung fu, especially if you're a fan of hung and/or lee. be warned, though: most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality. there is also a character in blackface which some people might find offensive.<br /><br />sammo hung is a rural swine-herder who moves to hong kong to fight off some bad guys. sammo turns on his dead-on bruce lee impersonation when fighting! <br /><br />this film is often billed as a parody of bruce lee's "enter the dragon", but it's not exactly that... sammo is a rural swine herder--obsessed with bruce lee--who moves to hong kong to help his relatives run a small open-air restaurant. once situated at the new job, he is forced to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money. when sammo switches into fighting mode, he switches on his bruce lee impersonation, which must be seen to be believed! this film is pretty sloppy, in many of the fight scenes sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists, and there's one character who's supposed to be black who is played by an asian man in heavy (and preposterous) makeup. but what this film lacks in budget and accuracy, it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy. highly recommended for a good mood."
