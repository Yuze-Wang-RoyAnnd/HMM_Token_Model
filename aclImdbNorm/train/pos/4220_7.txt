this is the one in which the diminutive ruth gordon plays an agatha-christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe. gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation, while gordon is traveling back and forth to new york. he manages, however, to leave behind some clues, scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note. columbo enters the case, suspects her at once, and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. oh, and mariette hartley is on hand as gordon's secretary and would-be blackmailer. hartley is, i believe, the grand daughter of the psychologist b. f. skinner. i'm not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button, which is on display during a belly dance sequence, but i've always admired skinner anyway.<br /><br />the murder is well handled. it's a good plot, and none of the performers or crew fluff anything. but the outstanding figure here is ruth gordon, only a skosh over five feet tall. she was over 80 years old and looked it. there are moments when she almost teeters, but she consistently exudes charm. her acting is idiosyncratic. you can never be sure when she's being serious or when she's putting columbo and the audience on. she's given some good lines too. what humor there is comes from gordon. columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comic moments.<br /><br />all in all, a nice job by everyone concerned.
