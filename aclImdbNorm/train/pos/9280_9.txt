in iran, women are officially banned from men's sporting events. in june 2005, the iran's national soccer team has an important game against bahrain in the azadi stadium for the qualification of the world cup. a group of iranian girls and lovers of soccer dresses like boys and unsuccessfully attempts to enter in the stadium being arrested.<br /><br />soccer (and flamengo's team), beach and movies are my greatest passions; therefore i loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for soccer. the director jafar panahi, from "the white balloon", "the mirror" and "the circle", shot this movie on the day that iran defeated bahrain and qualified to the world cup in germany. the dramatic and funny adventure of these iranian girls is one of the most delightful movies i have ever seen. my vote is nine.<br /><br />title (brazil): not available
