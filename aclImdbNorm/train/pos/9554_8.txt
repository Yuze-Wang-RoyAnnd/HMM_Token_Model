lock up your daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedies i have ever seen.<br /><br />it is misunderstood since it lacks the "social commentary" values that many films of the day (1969) required to be successful.<br /><br />the characters are over-the-top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors.<br /><br />christopher plummer shines especially bright as lord foppington, a noble with hair too big to fit in the door.<br /><br />the plot involves the usual 18th century stuff; mistaken identities, thwarted romances, corrupt government officials, and jokes at every turn.<br /><br />it answers the questions: what happens when 4 rambunctious, eager to party sailors are on leave in a small british coastal town? and, who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out?<br /><br />despite doing poorly at the box office, it has great costumes, excellent music(based on the mermaid theatre musical of the same name), great,lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic.<br /><br />that it has never been released on either vhs or dvd is truly a shame, since so many bad movies are released every day.
