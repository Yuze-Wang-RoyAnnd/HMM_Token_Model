this is one the few movies i can watch over and over. if you've never seen it, give it a shot. richard dreyfus and raoul julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me greatly, it reminds me of julia's untimely demise. it is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these time of terror and fear.
