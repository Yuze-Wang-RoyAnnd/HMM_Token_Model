while this was a better movie than 101 dalmations (live action, not animated version), i think it still fell a little short of what disney could do. it was well-filmed, the music was more suited to the action, and the effects were better done (compared to 101). the acting was perhaps better, but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel, and glenn close is really not to be missed, as in the first movie. she makes it shine. her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of, and they add to the spectacle disney has given us. this is a great family film, with little or no objectionable material, and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike. it's bound to be a classic, as so many disney films are. here's to hoping the third will be even better still- because you know they probably want to make one. ;)
