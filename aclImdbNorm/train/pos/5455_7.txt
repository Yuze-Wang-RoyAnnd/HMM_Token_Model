infamous pre-code film, really the one film that caused people to insist on the hayes code being strictly enforced. barbara stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor-selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers. when he dies in an accident, she's released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants. she goes to new york and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. although obviously there's no actual sex shown, the film is quite sleazy. unfortunately, after the initial shock value fades (around the time stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free), the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull. stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through. as always, she's fantastic.
