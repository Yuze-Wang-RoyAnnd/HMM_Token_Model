a fabulous film. with everything you could want in a film. huge battle scenes and lots of other action. suspense, and a romantic love story. <br /><br />kind of like an old swashbuckler film. totally entertaining from start to finish. <br /><br />the editing was fast and you are never bored for a second. the story is like a classic story of trouble in the royal household. the actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent. the costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative. the special effects are amazing too.<br /><br />gary stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at. he looks like a sure bet for super stardom. <br /><br />john rhys-davies is wonderful as he usually is. he is one of the great actors of our time.<br /><br />and cindy burbridge, ex miss thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady, even doing an english accent with remarkable success. <br /><br />i found out that the film has won numerous awards, and i can see why.<br /><br />all in all this is an amazing independent film. see it for sure. <br /><br />i highly recommend it. and give it a ten +!!!
