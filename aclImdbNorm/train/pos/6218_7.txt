79/100. fred astaire and ginger rogers never made anything but great films together. although this is not one of their best, it is an excellent musical. there are a few outstanding musical numbers, good support from randolph scott. two notable appearances, betty grable and lucille ball make memorable early screen performances. ball is particularly good, and a blonde as well. the "let's face the music and dance" is one of the musical duo's best numbers ever. harriet hilliard, better know as harriet nelson of "ozzie and harriet" plays ginger roger's sister. the basic plot is pretty familiar, but with a cast this exceptional, it works. excellent art direction and score.
