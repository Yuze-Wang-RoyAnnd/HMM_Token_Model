when seeing this movie you should take notice to that it's not a normal movie. it has no real story just characters, a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony. the dialogue is wonderful, you can just lay back and listen. the movie stands out thats why it's hard to find a right way of describing it.<br /><br />thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed.<br /><br />i for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one-liners and things that differ from the "normal". you can't really put the finger on what's so wonderful about it it's just a comical world where gangsters rule. a place of love and danger. a movie that you can see more than one time.
