soap opera about a small town married woman (kay francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on broadway. when a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his "manager" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but "experience" to become a big star. her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for hubby. next thing you know she's joined a traveling burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk!<br /><br />this film has a pretty interesting plot, well, a bit far-fetched perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all *greatly* enhanced by the strong, emotional performance given by kay francis - she just makes this film. also helping here is the well-done acting by minna gombell in her role as a "getting close to forty" older lady who works the burlesque and befriends kay. worth seeing, especially for kay francis fans.
