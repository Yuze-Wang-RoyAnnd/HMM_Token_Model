amazing acting, music. a simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through. i don't know why it was so fantastic but it simply was. so many of the characters were so real. it moved me and made me think i would like to watch more like this.<br /><br />the idea of a school trip as a forum for such an amazing plot was a genius idea and so many of the people were like people were like those encountered every day by teachers in the classroom.<br /><br />the film tackles issues of religion, prejudice,drugs friendship, memories, difficult experiences and simple the diversity of life itself.
