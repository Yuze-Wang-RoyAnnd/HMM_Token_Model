just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion(and justice) to the movie.<br /><br />first of all, to get things straight, this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie. it doesn't aim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor does it want to be regarded as one. if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest, i suggest you discard your critical-mindedness and your longing for a good plot because you won't find any in here. with that established, let us further into the movie.<br /><br />i had low expectations for this movie simply because it didn't have a strong plot(yes, moviegoers, i underrated this movie as well), but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much. i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flicks(which i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and would've rated it a 9 as well). action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right places.<br /><br />spoilers alert, i think the action might be unreal, but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways? there are a lot other sports movies(drama) that already did it well, why create another? spoilers end<br /><br />i'm not even sure why you're reading this. go ahead and watch it. just remember, no thinking - just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh, and <br /><br />every once in a while they(the movie industry) creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies, and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump. i'm not saying kung fu dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have, then again, if we're talking about stephen chow-ish comedy, this one's a top ten.<br /><br />highly recommended if you love: -no brainer movies with really good action -kung fu -death trance -kung fu and comedy -what the heck, watch this. you'll have a great time.<br /><br />9/10 for you the cast of kung fu dunk. ^_^
