i first saw this movie back in the early '90's when it was first released. room with a view was also newly out. enchanted april had so much more to offer! i found it much more real and earthy, the characters more believable for being 'normal'. by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice, i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation, peace, liberty or love. you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known, that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting. but in the heat of the spring in april, everyone's lives loosen and unravel (in line with the victorian corsets) and are slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction. what a little gem of a film! how come it isn't more well known?
