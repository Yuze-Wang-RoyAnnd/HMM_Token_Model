this is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesn't appear literally until half way in. nevertheless i was engaged by the hook of the phantom lady. curtis, though competent as the falsely accused scott henderson, looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards (perhaps he should have shaved his moustache) and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence. while another commentator had a problem with franchot tone as jack marlowe i found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex. he is no stock villain. superb character actor elisha cook jr. is again in top form as the 'little man with big ambitions.' his drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. this movie however is carried by the very capable and comely ella raines as the devoted would be lover of henderson, carol richmond. she definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of lauren bacall. this is the first of her work i have seen and i am definitely inclined to see her other roles. the rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent. all in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to. recommended, 8/10.
