as a rule, a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film. but because i've enjoyed jeffrey combs in other films, i gave it a shot.<br /><br />it's not bad. not great, but that's something else. the film involves a struggle with a mystic (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds, and the title character. dr. mordrid also has to deal with people, and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully.<br /><br />possible spoilers follow.<br /><br />dr. mordrid can travel between "dimensions," and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress; however, the guard has been blinded. his eyes are ruined pits. so the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes, and hey, presto! his eyes have been restored! this sort of healing apparently only works with eyes.<br /><br />later, mordred and his "brother" animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. guess which one wins.<br /><br />however, side from that, the picture isn't at all bad, though much like a comic book. dr. mordred's more "human" adventures are okay, and combs plays the role convincingly.<br /><br />i've seen lots worse.
