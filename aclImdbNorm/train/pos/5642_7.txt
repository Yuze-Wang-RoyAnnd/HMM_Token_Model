(spoilers in first paragraph) this movie's anti-german sentiment seems painfully dated now, but it's a brilliant example of great war-time propaganda. it was made back when cecil b. demille was still a great director. (ignore all his later best picture academy awards; he never made a very good sound film.) this movie lacks the comedy of most of pickford's other films, and really it was demille's movie, not pickford's. the vilification of the germans can be compared to the way "the patriot" of 2000 did the same to the british. the only good german in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of austreheim. they even had pickford take an ill-fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a german submarine. so what'll get the americans more stirred up to war? the sinking of the lusitania, or watching america's favorite canadian import sinking in it? all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another, barely escaping death, hypothermia, depravity, rape, execution, and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed. the way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in "jurassic park" were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors. if i was any more gullible to such propaganda i would punish myself for having a part-german ancestry. <br /><br />was it a good film? aside from a humorous running gag about americans abroad thinking they're untouchable
