the van is a simple teensploitation picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of it's way to make you feel comfortable, providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. danny devito has a small yet plentiful role as the manager of a car wash and almost steals the show! all the leads are well acted, the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture. a crown international release.
