i remember watching this in the 1970s - then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library.<br /><br />with a nearly 30 year hiatus, i have come to another conclusion. most of the principals interviewed in this series - some at the center of power like traudl junge (hitler's secretary),karl doenitz (head of germany's navy) anthony eden (uk) - are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on.from generals and admirals to sergeants, russian civilians, concentration camp survivors, all are on record here. <br /><br />i can remember the lord mountbatten interview (killed in the 1970s) <br /><br />this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work - well deserved.<br /><br />seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set.<br /><br />this is the only "10" i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine, it is more appreciated with a little time...
