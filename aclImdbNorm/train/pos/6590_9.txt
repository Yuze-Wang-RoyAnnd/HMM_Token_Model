intelligent, wry, and thrilling, "the invisible man" stood out in 2000 among sci-fi's usual lineup, balancing out "farscape"'s fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty, cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. the show sat between "law and order" and "doctor who" on the believability meter, but there was no denying the fact that "i-man"'s characters went beyond caricature. even characters that verged on predictability like the keeper, the official, and eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic. paul ben-victor and vincent ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly, made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors. the effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. the show's low points are still entertaining, and i've never seen such taut pilot episodes. matt greenberg and sci-fi should be commended, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive dvd edition of the show. every time i come across a marathon of "hercules: the legendary journeys" on sci-fi, i roll my eyes and sigh, mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that "invisible man" and its ilk represented.
