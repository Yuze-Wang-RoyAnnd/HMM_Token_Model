channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels, this show was certainly a naughty one. the presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show, four-time bafta winning and british comedy award winning (also twice nominated) graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this. it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it. they basically had an adult idea which would either gross, humiliate or humour the guest, but some are not for the faint-hearted. they had women playing the recorder with their parts, men using their dicks to play a xylophone, women weeing upwards in the bath, men with or without pants under their kilts, and many more gross but hilarious ideas. this is just for adults, but enjoy it! it won the bafta twice for best entertainment (programme or series), it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme (also nominated), best comedy talk show, it won an emmy for episode #18 (?), and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show. it was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny moments. very good!
