had placed this on my tivo for a rainy day due to the cast, some really hard working people in the industry, and when i finally watched i was not disappointed.<br /><br />this movie has some altman-like flavor (he's mentioned in the end credits as a "thanks" person) utilizing seemingly independent unrelated plot lines that intertwine as the film draws to its climax. macy is pure, clean, and honest as a man who can't seem to escape his "destiny", sutherland plays and portrays as few can, neve adds splash to a deliberately toned down environment, add tracy ullman, barbara bain (remember mission impossible on tv?), not to mention the steady john ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good film. the script is uncluttered, the dialog is free from clich'e and thoughtful (especially between macy and david dorfman). suspend belief and enjoy, this is truly time well spent.
