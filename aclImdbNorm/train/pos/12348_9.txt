it helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place. first of all, these ladies are not geisha, they are oiran (prostitutes)in the yoshiwara-type "green houses", circa 1860, give or take.. this should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware. the film deals with issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps most importantly, how people deal with adversity, both their own and that of others in their immediate environment. that plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music, make for a lovely ride. just plug it in, suspend your disbelief and enter their world. you won't be disappointed.
