loved this show...smart acting, smart dialog, great storyline with real people....please bring it back or make it available online...really miss it.. hope davis really shines in this show. i like the idea of six degrees... it really makes sense in this insane world. rid yourself of those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance please bring it back not to grovel..but please! when it went off the air, i watched in online and liked how i could watch it with minimal interruptions, in fact, online abc makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them on prime time...gone are the days of endless taping. anytime you want to bring it back, i am ready.
