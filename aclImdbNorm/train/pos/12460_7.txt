farewell friend aka adieu l'ami/honour among thieves isn't perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault, one to return stolen bonds, the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend. naturally things aren't quite that simple even after they open the vault, leading to some neat twists and turns. on the debit side, there's a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park, bronson has a very irritating fonzie-like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments, brigitte fossey, sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the 60s (it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind), is something of a liability
