i love horses and admire hand drawn animation, so i expected nothing short of amazement from dreamworks new animated picture spirit: stallion of the cimarron. i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed. you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story. a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. the animals don't sing cute songs or even talk -- a major plus. sadly, the film has an uncalled for narration by matt damon; a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams; and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production. if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity, we'd have a masterpiece here. this is not a great film, but it is good entertainment for small children. i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that isn't offensive to small children. not bad, but could have been much better. very pretty visuals though.
