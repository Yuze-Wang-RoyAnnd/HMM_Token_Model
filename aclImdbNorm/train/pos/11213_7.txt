this second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense. we know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen. then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them. we know there will be dynamite in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have a crash, just to speak of the car. and that is what happens. now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film. that he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap. now, how is he going to get out of it? that's what you must discover by yourself. and don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story. a speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river. we also know when he is going to be wounded. they did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days. it's true recently it was discovered that some gis did not have that kind of equipment in iraq. but what is the meaning of such a film? this insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. but the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance? when something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them, to do them. it is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive.<br /><br />dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
