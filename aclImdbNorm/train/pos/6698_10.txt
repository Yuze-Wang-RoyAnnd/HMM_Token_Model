i used to love sabrina the teenage witch and have seen every single episode. i remember when i used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on nickelodeon, however when sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill. the best series has to be when she was friends with valerie (i'm not sure which one that is). from there the next series (friends with dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right. all the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old "sparkle", however the first series where sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right. she is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without hilda and zelda and josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't harvey. thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. all in all i still love to watch the old episodes of sabrina the teenage witch, but i think the writers took it too far and should have left it with sabrina leaving high school. because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic
