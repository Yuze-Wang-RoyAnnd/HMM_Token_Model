what keeps us going - or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed. without spoiling so much, of course there is a red herring and a twist. but then we discover that this is the story of martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in coping. when there is the revelation - we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick, perverted pedophiliac that we're predisposed to have in mind. one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof. these problems of course are given their denouement in the film's shocking finale.<br /><br />this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear. they were heckling obviously because they aren't partial to "central location" films. although there is a bit of travelling, when we get to the woods and the beach. and we realize that gallien isn't as clever as we are made to think he is.<br /><br />the inquisitor is 5/5
