despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced. presented in digestible (as digestible as war can be) episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time. eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the u.s. the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year.
