lots and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen zizek, you know his pace.<br /><br />also if you haven't seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this doc, you will be somewhat lost. <br /><br />and the film list is long. director includes hitchcock (psycho, vertigo, birds), lynch (lost highway,mullholland falls, wild at heart, blue velvet ), tarkovsky (stalker, solaris) and the conversation(coppola) <br /><br />there are some segway films like, star wars: espisode iii, matrix ... but these i suspect are baits. to be sure, zizek is never boring, but if you don't buy (or if you mind) the psycho analytics, then you'll be annoyed to no end. <br /><br />but you should not be, as the setting, clips, the way the film interleave with these clips, zizek's points are never boring.
