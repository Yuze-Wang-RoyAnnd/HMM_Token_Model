personnaly i really loved this movie, and it particularly moved me. the two main actors are giving us such great performances, that at the end, it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters.<br /><br />the alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous, and the song are just great the way they are. <br /><br />that's why i didn't feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards (the most rewarded movie at the golden globes), an oscar and even a grammy. this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. a great movie, that has often been criticized (maybe because streisand dared to get involved in it, surely as a "co-director"). her artistry is the biggest, and that will surely please you!
