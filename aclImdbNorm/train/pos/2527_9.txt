this is what i call a "pre sci fi; sci fi" movie. it gets no better than lugosi/karloff in this incredibly good "mood" type motion picture. these two genuine artists are at their very best, as is the story line.<br /><br />karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity, pride, and scientific competition. i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts. i was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in. <br /><br />this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake. this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe kieffer sutherland as the bela lagosi role. it might be possible to do it almost as good.<br /><br />this is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced. as i said..it gets no better. no way.
