yes, it's flawed - especially if you're into hollywood films that demand a lot of effects, a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot, and you can't actually think for yourself.<br /><br />roeg's films are for the intelligent film-goer, and insignificance is a perfect example.<br /><br />the characterizations are brilliant, the story is excellent, but, like all nic roeg's films - it has you thinking on every level about aspects of reality that would never have dawned on you before. his films always make you think, and personally, i like that in a film.<br /><br />so don't expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy-happy, because it's likely you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />but i think it's excellent.
