mcconaughey in a horror/thriller? i had to see this. i was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />the plot is told in flashback mode, and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament. i can't say much more without spoiling the whole movie, sorry. just know that if you decide to watch it, you'll be, in the very least, surprised.<br /><br />all the main players are very good. bill paxton did a great job directing those kids, and his acting is awesome. mcconaughey's acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />this movie challenges you to think. is dad crazy? is there a god? do demons exist? how far would you go to right a wrong. and what is "right" anyway? i'm still thinking.<br /><br />and thus i recommend "frailty". 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second, or even third viewing.
