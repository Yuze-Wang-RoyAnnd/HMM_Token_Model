playwright sidney bruhl (michael caine) has had a series of flop plays after a huge hit. he receives a play written by a student of his, clifford anderson (christopher reeve) which is fantastic. it's so good sidney says he would kill for it. will he?<br /><br />a thinking man's thriller. it was originally a play...and it shows. it's mostly on one set and all talk but i was never bored. it's very well-written with plenty of twists and a good cast working full force. caine is just great as bruhl--another one of his great performances. reeve is, surprisingly, very good. i never thought much of him as an actor, but he's really good in this role. dyan cannon does wonders with an underwritten role as bruhls' wife. irene worth is also good (and quite funny) as helga ten drop, a psychic. however, her accent did get on my nerves. director sidney lumet does very well with his one set. the camera is always moving and keeps your attention going.<br /><br />extreme spoiler dead ahead!!!!! my only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging sociopaths and it also contains one of the most unromantic kisses i've ever seen--but these are mild complaints.<br /><br />a very good thriller. critics hate this movie (for some reason) and it seems to have completely disappeared since it premiered in 1982. that's too bad--it deserves better.
