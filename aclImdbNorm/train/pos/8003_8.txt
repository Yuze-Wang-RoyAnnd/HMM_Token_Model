this movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend. there are laughs galore and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here. the actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty. maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types. the australian coast scenery is, simply, splendid to see. what a place to visit, to say the least, and one day it may become my hideaway. i really enjoy this movie and every time i watch it i enjoy it more. i would love to see more of these characters and i always wonder what became of them. although the plot is somewhat soft, this movie is, of course, a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories.
