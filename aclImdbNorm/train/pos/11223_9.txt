tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud. the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself.<br /><br />there are a few surprises. as cynical as we are today, i fully expected the 'good girl' to be crying over his grave, instead of his buddy's. especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend', when she first meets matt. and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr. allen's face, blinding him (interesting role by bruce dern). wrrrooonnnnggg!!! some of the other hollywood endings do happen, but the writing is so excellent, the acting so carefully wrought that you're blissfully unaware.<br /><br />and the music is out of this world. taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passions' were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley. even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago, but at a club called, wonderfully, 'biloxi' with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks. i'll be watching it again, just to hear the music. good thing i have the factotum sound track, so i can listen to that in the car. watch both together, and you'll see how matt has matured....playing bar room characters in both. now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc, he probably has great opportunity to do his studies. great actor, just coming into his own. he shows finely nuanced performances ...the good and the bad in his characters. his 'young boy off the farm' is a great study, made especially poignant because of his bassett-hound eyes. he makes love, convincingly as well. since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen-ager, i wonder how that it ...making love to an actress you kinda grew up with. adds conviction, i'll say that.
