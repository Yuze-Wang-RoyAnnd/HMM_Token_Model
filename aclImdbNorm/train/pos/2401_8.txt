guy kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laughs. like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. warren william, a very, under rated actor, is superb in giving instructions to kibbee; that is, he teaches him to say something which means nothing to the voting public. a campaign based on no comment, "i'll take it under advisement," and "maybe yes, but then again, maybe no," is the nearly perfect way to win an election. succinctly, the dumber the candidate, the greater the chance he or she will win. after all, the public can identify with such a person. with respect to the movie, it makes for a lot of comedy.
