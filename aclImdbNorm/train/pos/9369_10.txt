this movie is proof that film noire is an enduring style, and extremely worthy of stay alive. for me, it is he best example of film noire since chinatown.<br /><br />it will, unfortunately, never get the recognition it deserves. it was never promoted properly when it was first released and has had to build its cadre of fans through venues like vanguard cinema and word of mouth rental referrals.<br /><br />i highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment rent this movie and delved into its highly convoluted plot.
