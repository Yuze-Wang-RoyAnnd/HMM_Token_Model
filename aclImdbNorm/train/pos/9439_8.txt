before watching this film i had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the film, but listening wasn't doing it for me so i planned on watching it and wow! ned beatty, ronny cox, jon voight and burt reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all. the character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend. the acting, dialogue is very very real, as close to reality as you can get for hollywood acting. reynolds character "lewis" was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man (i was impressed with his performance!) jon voight seems to be the character thats on the spotlight the most, the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end (his character transition was excellent). ned beatty and ronny cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and don't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too, and they did... i really was amazed at director boorman's vision of dickey's novel, very impressed. you cannot go your whole life without watching this film. i give it eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.
