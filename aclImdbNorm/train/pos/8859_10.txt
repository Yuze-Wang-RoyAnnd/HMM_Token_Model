the full title of this film is 'may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead', a rewording of the old irish toast 'may you have food and raiment, a soft pillow for your head; may you be 40 years in heaven, before the devil knows you're dead.' first time screenwriter kelly masterson (with some modifications by director sidney lumet) has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes. in this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but, here, very sensible manipulation of the flashback/flash forward technique of storytelling. by repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale, we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong. <br /><br />andy hanson (philip seymour hoffman) is a wealthy executive, married to an emotionally needy gina (marisa tomei), and addicted to an expensive drug habit. his life is beginning to crumble and he needs money. andy's ne're-do well younger brother hank (ethan hawke) is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife martha (amy ryan), is behind in alimony and child support, and has borrowed all he can from his friends, and he needs money. andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe, quick cash for both. the glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents - charles (albert finney) and nanette (rosemary harris). andy advances hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that hank will do the actual robbery, but though hank agrees to the 'fail-safe' plan, he hires a friend to take on the actual job while hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car. the robbery is horribly botched when nanette, filing in for the regular clerk, shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess. the disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when nanette dies, charles and andy and hank (and their respective partners) are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn. <br /><br />each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances, and while we have come to expect that from hoffman, hawke, tomei, finney, ryan, and harris, it is the wise hand of direction from sidney lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful. it is not an easy film to watch, but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect, a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be. grady harp
