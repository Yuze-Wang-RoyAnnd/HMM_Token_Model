what surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted. similar films such as anita and me have never caused as much hype as this film has, though i think that's probably because of the mention of 'beckham' in the title more than anything else.<br /><br />it's a brilliant film putting across a brilliant message - you can do anything if you're determined enough, and put your mind to it, which is such a positive message to anyone watching this film.<br /><br />i think this is one of keira knightley's better films, and i think she's a brilliant actress, and was excellent for the role. parminder nagra was brilliant too. sadly, i can't say this for jonathan rhys-meyers, because i don't think that he was that much of a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little scary.<br /><br />all in all, a brilliant film, and a brilliant story
