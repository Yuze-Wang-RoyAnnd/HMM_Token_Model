most italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since because it has no connection to the first two demons films. and with the "demons iii" in the title, one would assume it would. the problem is that this film was never intended to be part of the demons series. the distributors only a "demons iii" above its original title "the ogre" to cash in on the other films popularity. the new american dvd release of this picture has the title "demons iii: the ogre" on the box art but the film itself only says "the ogre". i don't know if past releases had the title "demons iii" on the actual film itself, but this new release just seems to be a little white lie. if you can get past the "demons iii" in the title, you might some enjoyment in "the ogre". it starts out with a creep intro, and stays pretty creep throughout. there's no gore and the film movies slowly, but i still dug it. just don't expect it to be like the other demons films. i give "the ogre" 7 out of 10. italian fans should try it out.
