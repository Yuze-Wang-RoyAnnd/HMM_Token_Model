this film was absolutely brilliant!! every performance in this film is excellent, especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper. it looks like mr gyllenhaal will have a huge film career if this is anything to go by. i thought that joe johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters(jumanji, honey i shrunk the kids). he pulls of every scene with sheer class. my favourite scene was where homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky, going down, as all of his dreams were, it was beautiful. joe johnston should direct more of these brilliant, acting driven films as well as his big budget blockbuster faire, which is also excellent. kudos!! to all involved in this masterpiece!
