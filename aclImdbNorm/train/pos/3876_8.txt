the lovely danish actress sonja richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone, no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding her.<br /><br />richter plays anna, an out-of-work, independent-minded, somewhat neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair-bound, muted, aged father named walentin (the great danish actor frits helmuth, who died at 77 shortly after this film was made).<br /><br />spoiler alert<br /><br />walentin refuses to respond to anyone --until he confronts the gifted anna, whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a self-imposed death sentence.<br /><br />writer/director/actor eric clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son (jorgen, played by clausen) has loving a father who has never accepted him. the film sags toward the end, but clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of loving and caring, and how one person, the irrepressible anna, can alter the course of a human life. highly recommended. sonja richter's performance is alone worth the price of admission.
