things to come is an historic film. along with metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles. it is also one of the first doomsday movies. it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year, and even, in a subtle way, the year it would end in the real world. but then the film departs from reality, depicting a world ravaged by war (only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936).<br /><br />the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight, making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings -- later to become staples of the science fiction genre. it is sad that, after things to come, sci-fi would become identified with cheaply made b-movies, a stereotype that wouldn't be broken until 2001:a space odyssey more than 30 years later. if they'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film, things would have been very different in hollywood. <br /><br />raymond massey and some of his co-stars play multiple roles in this film, to good effect. massey plays a great "doctor who"-like role as a pilot from an advanced (for 1970) civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord (a very effective performance by ralph richardson). ultimately, the storyline covers 100 years. but that's a big problem with this film -- there really isn't a cohesive storyline.<br /><br />perhaps in such an episodic film -- somewhat reminiscent of intolerance, actually -- it's hard to have a conventional plot, but i felt more could have been made of the material, and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission ... the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting. maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci-fi innovation: a sequel?<br /><br />things to come is a film every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once. unlike metropolis, however, it might not bear repeated viewings.
