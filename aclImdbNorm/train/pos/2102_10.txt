when i sat down to watch 'largo winch' i expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. when i stood up, i've seen both of these; and more.<br /><br />karl roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie, to start with. kristin scott thomas played her role well, but the real two stars in my opinion were tomer sisley and miki manojlovic, both acting superbly. in radivoje bukvic portrayed goran well.<br /><br />the mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie, but i understand why people would get bored with it.<br /><br />the scenery of hong kong and especially the stunning croatian seaside both amazed me, and i hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island.<br /><br />rolls royce phantom; mercedes s500, and bmw 7; if anyone loves expensive limousine - type cars; this is their movie. it is also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extremal beauty, and above all, a fast - paced, well written action movie, with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama.<br /><br />my vote, as it has enlightened a gloomy day is: 10/10
