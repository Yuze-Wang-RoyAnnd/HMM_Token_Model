jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing. it's like watching a no frills music video today.<br /><br />the jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of marie bryant who sings a classic version of on the sunny side of the street. i had never heard her sing before, bryant sounds remarkably like billie holliday. that's a compliment folks.<br /><br />their instrumental work is tops as well. with the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotypes, this film is to be watched and treasured. no great production values, just a lot of good music.
