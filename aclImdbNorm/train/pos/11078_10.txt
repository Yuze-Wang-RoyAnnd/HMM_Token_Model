i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away. it is a real masterpiece of art and i don't understand why most of the people think it's garbage. the main idea of the movie - take your ego away and then you will have true power! this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way. "the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look" - do you remember this from the movie? because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego... that voice that always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, that tells us not to give, but only to take, that creates our aggression, that wants to be in control, that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts. gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance. a superb movie!
