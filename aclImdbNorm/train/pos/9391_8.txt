dennis hopper and jt walsh steal the show here. cage and boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is hopper's creepy, violent character and jt walsh's sneakiness.<br /><br />a drifter gets mistaken for a hit-man, and tries to make a little dough out of it, but gets in over his head.<br /><br />i found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie, when cage walks into a trailer in wyoming to get drilling work, with the help of his buddy...and the opening scene in brokeback mountain, when the character does the same thing! but that's another story.<br /><br />dennis hopper is at his best here...cocky, one-step-ahead villainous, seething and explosively violent. jt walsh (rip) is also great as the man with a dark past, trying to live legitimately (well, almost).<br /><br />there are only 4 real characters of note here, with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of red rock, wyoming. the first twist hits early on, and from there it's a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town. satisfying. 8 pts.
