this is, in my opinion, a very good film, especially for michael jackson lovers. it contains a message on drugs, stunning special effects, and an awesome music video.<br /><br />the main film is centered around the song and music video 'smooth criminal.' unlike the four-minute music video, it is normal speed and, in my opinion, much easier to watch.<br /><br />the plot is rather weird, however. michael jackson plays a magical 'gangster' that, when he sees a shooting star, he transforms into a piece of machinery. throughout the film, he transforms into a race car, a giant robot, and a space ship.<br /><br />the robot scene in particular is a bit drawn out and strange. i found it a little out-of-whack compared to the rest of the film.<br /><br />a child is kidnapped, michael tries to save her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys. a little weird? yeah.<br /><br />but besides the bizarre robot scene, it's a very good movie, and any michael jackson fan will enjoy both the smooth criminal music video and the movie.
