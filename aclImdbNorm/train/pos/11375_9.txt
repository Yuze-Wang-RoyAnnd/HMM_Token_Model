this movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion. from the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator, you'll be entranced. it's an absolute must-see for anyone interested in criminology. interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great. not overly done either. i recommend it for anyone interested in russian history, too. how the police work with the political party being what it was... it is truly fascinating and frustrating. the settings are beautiful. it's been a while since i saw this movie the first time. it doesn't diminish it's impact. not overly dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough to the imagination, well, you'll see.
