i would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes. you people are so damn sensitive it is inane! so quick to point out the "racism" of the show and the jokes, yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist, pig-headed crap like "well, duh, some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women." so disgusting. abortion jokes are great because, really, who takes abortion seriously anyways? at least i'm not a*bore*son. i hear that reba mcentire and sarah silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together. talk about a movie of the year!
