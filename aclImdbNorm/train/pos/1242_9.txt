i love this film. it is well written and acted and has good cinematography. the story blends action, humor, mysticism, and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots. see it, buy it, show it to your friends.<br /><br />the acting is good and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant/unlikely hero. i enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions.<br /><br />i cared what happened to these people and, while the outcome was pretty predictable (the good guys win, the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives--who doesn't see that coming?), it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end. thank god this film's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel. grab some popcorn, cuddle up on the couch, and watch this fun, happy and entertaining film.
