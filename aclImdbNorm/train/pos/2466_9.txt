i have never observed four hours pass quite so quickly as when i saw this film. this film restores the power and art to hamlet that it was always meant to have. even those oh-so famous speeches are done in new and inventive ways. and the cast is incredible, brannagh the brightest star. it is his charisma, power and command of the role that defines the movie. making it a full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length. where one would expect the dark, gloomy cliched castle, we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes. the only gloom comes from hamlet himself, as it should. well worth your time, all four hours of it.
