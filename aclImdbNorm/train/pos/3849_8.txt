this last dutch speaking film of verhooven made me laugh good. as a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie i can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses. i haven't read gerard reves book, on which the film is based, but i still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat self-conceited poet/writer who gets his (in a way - no spoiling here). an anti-hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions, as has he. all this in a superbly packaged cinematography, paul verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute "gesellich(?)" dutch locations into a suspenseful film-noir setting, impressive work!
