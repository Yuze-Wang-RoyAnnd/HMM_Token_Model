a suspenseful thriller that bears some resemblance to deliverance as for scenery and setting. there are also some very innovatively shot scenes and good music, although the daftness and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is unfitting to the situation, although this is not a mayor problem. it also poses interesting questions about justness of revenge and limits of friendship.<br /><br />
