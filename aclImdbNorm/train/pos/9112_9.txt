being half-portuguese doesn't render me half-blind (nor half-prejudiced) when discussing portuguese films. not that i get to do that very often anyway. but this film was such a rush of adrenaline! yes, that's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history went/goes - but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese-film territory: things like using real locations in the middle of traffic-congested lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. and by god did they get it right! ok, to sum it up: very emotional if you've lived through it, but you'll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were. if you're just watching it randomly, you're in for a good historical romp, only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual. even by european standards, yes.
