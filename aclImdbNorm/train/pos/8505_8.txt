many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it's the first 3d game, or even the first shoot-'em-up. it's also one of the first stealth games, one of the only(and definitely the first) truly claustrophobic games, and just a pretty well-rounded gaming experience in general. with graphics that are terribly dated today, the game thrusts you into the role of b.j.(don't even *think* i'm going to attempt spelling his last name!), an american p.o.w. caught in an underground bunker. you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes(but, let's face it, most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon, surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders). the graphics are, as i mentioned before, quite dated and very simple. the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators. if you can get over that, however(and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you), then you've got one heck of a good shooter/sneaking game. the game play consists of searching for keys, health and ammo, blasting enemies(aforementioned nazis, and a "boss enemy" per chapter) of varying difficulty(which, of course, grows as you move further in the game), unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms. there is a bonus count after each level is beaten... it goes by how fast you were(basically, if you beat the 'par time', which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level; this can be quite fun to try and beat, and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in, they are even challenging after many play-throughs), how much nazi gold(treasure) you collected and how many bad guys you killed. basically, if you got 100% of any of aforementioned, you get a bonus, helping you reach the coveted high score placings. the game (mostly, but not always) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing... stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see. you can either run or walk, and amongst your weapons is also a knife... running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard, as is gunshots. many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you, meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them... nearly silently. in your inventory, you can get no less than four weapons and two keys... more about the weapons later. the keys unlock certain doors. most doors in the game aren't locked... only two kinds need keys, and these keys are only introduced in later levels(you restart in levels, resetting weaponry, health, score and lives in each chapter). much of the later game is spent looking for them. now, as i just alluded to, this game, like many of the period(late 80's, early 90's), is based on collecting extra lives... personally, i think it's completely and utterly useless(it was mercifully dropped from here on end... i think(?), from the next 3d shooter and onwards), since you can save anytime you want and 'using a life' resets weaponry, health and ammo, like starting on a new chapter(which is a real pain in later levels, where you *need* heavier artillery). now, i shall beat around the bush no longer... moving on to the guns! you start with aforementioned knife(which is silent but only effective up close) and a pistol... nothing special, but good for conserving ammo, unlike the next two bad boys. your third weapon is a german smg... a sub-machine-gun. it's faster and automatic, and some later enemies use it. and the last one... is nothing short of a gatling gun! oh yeah! think t2. think predator. think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun. it's every bit as entertaining as it sounds. most of the boss enemies use this, though, so be prepared. i won't reveal the identities of these boss enemies, however... that's for each player to discover for him(or her)self. the sound is excellent... very crisp and realistic. as you hear the tear of a machine-gun firing, the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german, you truly feel like you are there, trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems. that segues me nicely into the level design... as you run through seemingly countless, nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further, you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood. i almost got motion sickness more than once(though that might also have something to do with little sleep, lots of humidity and unusual warmth...) from playing. though the level of detail isn't terribly high, what there is is great. remains of victims, guards' quarters and countless nazi symbols... the list goes on. the game also features quite a bit of gore... for it's limited graphics engine, john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game. what is there left to say... the first of its kind, and it's no wonder this spawned countless others 3d shooters. sure, weapon bobbing and different height levels(stairs and such) didn't come around until the next entry into the genre... doom... and it was duke nukem 3d that introduced the feature of switching your view(so it goes beyond simply left and right, adding vertical dimensions to it), and jumping didn't come around until a third, later title(the first quake, possibly? fellow gamers, help me out here)... but all of those games, as well as the rest of the genre, owe their existence to this one. so load up the luger, open the door to enter the bunker and step into b.j.'s shoes... he deserves the recognition, even(or maybe even especially?) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared. i recommended this to all fans of 3d games. 8/10
