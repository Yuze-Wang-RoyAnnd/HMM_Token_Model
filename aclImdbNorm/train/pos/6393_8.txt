this is a must see for independant movie fans, but it also holds up well against mainstream movies. i think we have the makings of the next woody allen or<br /><br />trentin tarrentino here.<br /><br />the budget is painfully low. no special effects whatsoever, and they seemingly used ambient lighting (shot in digital video.) -and yet this movie grabs hold of you and never lets go. the screenplay is somewhat bizarre, yet the actors and director pull it off with complete realism. it has humor, it has intrigue, and it has pathos, and it all works together.<br /><br />no point in describing the details. if you want to see an independant<br /><br />masterpiece, a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flick that really works, see this one.<br /><br />-oh yeah, it's also really entertaining.<br /><br />
