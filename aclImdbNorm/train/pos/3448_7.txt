a documentary without a loss for words... ever...<br /><br />let us assume that the narration is more than a spoof, let us assume it is a commentary on japanese society. and as this film is as fast paced an absurdist documentary as they come, the constant wordplay, as fast is it goes, and as poorly translated as it is-- in its current festival screener version as seen tonight at the copenhagen cinematek-- it is still quite enjoyable. <br /><br />but for the patient, and only the truly patient and open-minded, i'm talking to you jim jarmusch fans with add relapses, i believe this is a film for you. it's an intelligent film if you allow it to win you over.<br /><br />quite beautiful, and quite kitsch, and quite japanese sub-culture. and quite experimental. static 2d in a 3d world. all in all, fun for those that want to see a japanese film that spoofs japanese food culture. a thumbs up if you're in the mood for something completely different.
