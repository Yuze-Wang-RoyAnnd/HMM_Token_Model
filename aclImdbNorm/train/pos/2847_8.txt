as it is generally known,anthology films don't fare very well with american audiences (i guess they prefer one standard plot line). new york,i love you, is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities & the people who live & love in them. the first was 'paris,j'taime', which i really enjoyed. the film was made up of several segments,each written and/or directed by a different director (most of which were french,but there is a very funny segment directed by joel & ethan coen). like 'paris', this one is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (fatih akin,mira nair,natalie portman,shakher kapur,etc.),and also like 'paris'deals with new yorkers,and why they love the city they live in. it features a top notch cast,featuring the likes of natalie portman,shia labeouf,christina ricci,orlando bloom,ethan hawki,and also features such seasoned veterans as james caan,cloris leachman,eli wallach and julie christie. some of the stories really fly,and others don't (although i suppose it will depend on individual tastes---i won't ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me & which ones didn't). word is that the next entry in the series will be shanghai, china (is rome,italy,berlin,germany or athens,greece out of the question?). spoken mainly in english,but does have bits of yiddish & russian with english subtitles. rated 'r'by the mpaa for strong language & sexual content
