i went to this movie at a cast and crew show cause my friend, whom is a producer on the movie invited me. forget what you have seen in the commercials, forget what you have heard, go see this film for yourself. i was more than surprised by it. in a world of the grinch, charlies angels, the 6th day, unbreakable, here comes a film that is worth your hard earned bucks! glorious scenes, wonderful cinemtrophy and a cast you want to eat with your heart. i found this to be one of this years most orchestrated powerhouse films and with reason. robert deniro deserves an oscar nod. if you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package, this would be the film.
