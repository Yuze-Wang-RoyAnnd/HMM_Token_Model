this documentary makes you travel all around the globe. it contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness. it shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be. the polar bear's future is highlighted at the beginning and at the end of it. after all, its bleak future is closely linked with the consequences of global warming. this documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious environmental issue. it can nonetheless be easily seen by young children since it mainly remains descriptive. scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of al gore's documentary "an inconvenient truth" but frankly...what a description!!! a question may then arise: isn't it worth preserving our world's beauty? because this documentary proves that in 2007 such a beauty still exists despite the different pollutions. by living in towns and cities we tend to forget that we are part and parcel of this nature. all things considered this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called "earth".
