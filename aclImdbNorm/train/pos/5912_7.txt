by dane youssef <br /><br />"coonskin" is film, by the one and only ralph bakshi, is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at life black in modern america (modern for the day, i mean--1975). paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame.<br /><br />but this is a bakshi film, controversial, thrilling, and a must-see almost by definition alone. not just another random "shock-jock" of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock. it's by ralph bakshi. anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie, he has something big to say...<br /><br />although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation, "coonskin" isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick. "coonskin" wants to be more. it aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish.<br /><br />the movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre. nor does it just indict black people, but actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places.<br /><br />"coonskin" tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break. the fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the "coonskin" world alone makes it old-fashioned.<br /><br />one of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in harlem named brother bear, brother rabbit, preacher fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary. the itallian mob is running all the real action.<br /><br />big name black musicians star: barry white and scatman crothers, as well as charles gordone, the first black playwright to take home the pulitzer. something big is happening here obviously.<br /><br />the movie plays out like a descent into this world, this side of the racial divide. from an angry, hip, deep, soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand.<br /><br />bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word "sublety." this one looks like it's never even heard of the word. but maybe a subject like this needs extremism. real sledgehammer satire. some subjects can't be tackled gently.<br /><br />bakshi is god-dammed merciless. here, no member or minority of the harlem scene appears unscathed.<br /><br />the characters here are "animated" to "real" all depending on what the mood and situation are. the animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally.<br /><br />bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value. he always has something to say. nor is black-face is gratuitously. here, unlike in spike lee's "bamboozled," he seems to be using it to try and really say something.<br /><br />like 99.9% of all of bakshi's films, this one incorporates animation and live-action. usually at the same time. bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here. all of this technique is all intertwined, meshing together while saying something.<br /><br />somehow, this one feels inevitably dated. many of these types of films (bakshi's included) are very topical, very spur of the moment. they reflect the certain trend for the day, but looking back of them years later, there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth).<br /><br />even though the music, clothes, slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f--king ear it is. anyone who's really seen the movies, the state of things and has been in company of the people know what i'm talking about.<br /><br />even some of the of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny), a big ol' bear and a fox. one of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these "dirty n-----s" after the death of a cop. but for him, it's not just business. nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield. it's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks.<br /><br />the sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film, of which there are many. it plays out like an opera or a ballet.<br /><br />the promo line: warning: "this film offends everybody!" this is not just hype. proceed with extreme caution.<br /><br />you have been warned...<br /><br />by dane youssef
