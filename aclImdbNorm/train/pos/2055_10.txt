this is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it. i wouldn't say that it is very scary, but more fun i guess. that is if you like horror movies. scarecrow kind of remembered me of "children of the corn", but still not. if you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch =)
