i don't think i'll ever understand the hate for renny harlin. 'die hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'cliffhanger', one of the most awesome action movies ever. that's right, you little punks, 'cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it.<br /><br />sly plays gabe walker, a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend, hal tucker (michael rooker), assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. walker obviously came back at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen (john lithgow). qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u.s. government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back...<br /><br />essentially, 'cliffhanger' is another 'die hard' clone. just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. naturally, that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough, as stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease, and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. after all, isn't that what action movies are all about?<br /><br />'cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. a showcase of great scenes and stunts. one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it maintains its action awesomeness. john lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad dude. quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.<br /><br />'cliffhanger' is easily one of stallone's best efforts, definitely renny harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
