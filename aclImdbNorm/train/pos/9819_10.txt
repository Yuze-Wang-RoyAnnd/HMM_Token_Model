this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama. my all-time favourite actor, robert culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system, kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime, and homicidal psychosis. the teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes, and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison. but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie, building the fear and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feel of the whole california setting. the cars are really great as well, as i recall. i give this film a 10, and i defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute. remember, just because it's made-for-television doesn't mean it isn't great art.
