the most amazing, spiritually uplifting movie about the restoration of the gospel. far better than any other film, or movie made about the restoration thus far. if you haven't seen it, hop on a plane to salt lake and see it now. you won't regret it! you truly get a sense of what the first saints had to struggle through, putting complete and total faith in there prophet joseph smith. you finally get some sort of comprehension of the things the prophet had to fight through and the persecutions he and his people faced. if you have any questions about the church of jesus christ of latter-days saints and our humble beginnings just watch this movie, it will make complete and total sense afterward.
