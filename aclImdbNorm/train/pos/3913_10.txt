carlos saura's carmen is one of the finest achievements in world, let alone spanish, cinema. it manages to excite interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations from bizet with powerful physical force. at the same time we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of carmen on the choreographer/director and the principle dancers. the fine line between life and art is dazzling.
