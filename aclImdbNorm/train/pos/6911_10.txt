while "the kiss of the spider woman" cast raul julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified latin american country, this time he works for a dictator in a fictional latin american country. specifically, the dictator suddenly drops dead, so julia replaces el presidente with a broadway actor (richard dreyfuss) shooting a movie in the country. from there, dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator, all the while balancing it with his own life.<br /><br />is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in latin america into comedy? well, "moon over parador" does a good job with it. no matter what they do in this movie, they pull it off. it just goes to show why richard dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era, and what we lost when raul julia died. definitely worth seeing. also starring sonia braga (who co-starred with raul julia in "tkotsw"), jonathan winters and sammy davis jr.<br /><br />i agree: the first lady is hot.
