bette midler is indescribable in this concert. she gives her all every time she is on stage. whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads, bette midler moves her audience. if you can't see it live (which is the best way to see bette) then this is the next best thing. an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. her more "vocally correct" version of "stay with me" never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness, here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. i will treasure this concert for a very long time.
