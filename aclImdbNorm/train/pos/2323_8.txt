"the man in the moon" is a pretty good movie. it is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects. i wouldn't say the film was terribly original, but what is these days?<br /><br />the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles. i really enjoyed seeing reese witherspoon at such a young age, and does quite a good job. jason london does a fine job as well. and the only other person i recognized was sam waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. i really liked sam's character (matthew trant) a lot. at times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread, but in the end you really like his character. the rest of the cast was very good as well.<br /><br />if you're into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you, then you ought to watch this film. i'd suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you'd be interested in, then go for it. anyhow, hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,<br /><br />-chris
