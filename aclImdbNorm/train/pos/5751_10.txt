what can i say about this movie? i have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6. i have seen the english version and it is done very well. it is a great movie for all ages, but it is directed more for children. i love the childlike humor and appreciate it. if you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
