i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read. it does not do justice to this incredible movie. for an example of a good summary, read the listing at "turner classic movies". anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a young child. my sister and i couldn't wait until every april when we could see it on t.v. it is one of the best horse movies of it's time. it is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. the romance is clean and endearing. the story line is interesting and the songs are great. they don't make movies like this anymore. good acting and not over the top. pat boone and shirley jones are at their best, along with many other great character actors.
