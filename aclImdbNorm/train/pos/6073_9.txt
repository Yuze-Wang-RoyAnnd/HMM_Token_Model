my college professor says that othello may be shakespeare's finest drama. i don't know if i agree with him yet. i bought this video version of the film. first i love kenneth branagh as iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. surprisingly, he didn't direct it but played a role. lawrence fishburne shows that american actors can play shakespeare just as well as british actors can do. not that there was a british vs. american issue about it. in fact, if we all work together then shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do. apart from other shakespeare tragedies, this is dealt with the issue of race. something that has existed since the beginning of time. the relationship between iago and emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together. while othello loves desdemona with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non-moorish man like cassio. it's quite a great scene at the end of the film but i won't reveal the ending. it's just worth watching. i think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit shakespeare.
