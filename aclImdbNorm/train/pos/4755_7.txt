a bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm. the police have closed the bridge--saying it's unsafe and they are stuck in a little caf'e until the road has been cleared. however, after a while, their boredom is turned to concern, as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally on the bus and may just be an alien!! this leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a low-brow way.<br /><br />this is another of the fun episodes of the twilight zone. instead of the typical twists or social commentary, this one features no lasting message. however, it's also very and watchable, so who cares?! exactly what occurs you'll just have to see for yourself.<br /><br />by the way, this one stars john hoyt--a face most of you will recognize from countless old tv shows and movies. in almost every case, he played a real grouch (like charles lane during the same era), but boy did i love seeing him--as he perfected the grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time.
