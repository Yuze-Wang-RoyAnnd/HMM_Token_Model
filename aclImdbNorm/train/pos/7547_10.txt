cat soup at first seems to be a very random animated film. the best way i've been able to explain it is that it's quite acidic. though it's not totally random. the story is about nyatta, a young cat boy and his sister nyaako. nyaako is very ill and dies, however, nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and is able to retrieve half of it. the story is about their quest to bring nyaako fully back to life.<br /><br />though a lot of the content in this movie seems completely random, it is not. most of it is symbolism for life, death and rebirth. you can also see references from other tales, such as hansel and gretal. this strangely cute short film has an interesting story, packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen.
