martin sheen, michelle phillips, stuart margolin and the late vic morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. mr. sheen, mr. margolin and mr. morrow all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles; ms. phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a made-for-tv movie (twenty-five years ago), by supplying the "sex interest" in an otherwise sexless film. the real star, however, is the "california kid"; a 1934 ford coupe, borrowed from "jake" jacobs, put before a camera and given a workout that'll leave the viewer panting, gasping and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation.<br /><br />the action scenes are spectacular, (although some of the dialog is a bit lame) making for a fine evening's diversion. this is how all "car movies" should be made.<br /><br />try to catch this one on the late movie channel; it's well worth the missed sleep.
