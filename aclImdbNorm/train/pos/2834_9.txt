i haven't seen much german comedy, but if this film is anything to go by, i'm compelled to see more! the simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from germany to italy after eva, an unemployed mother of two, discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. i won't reveal anything further, but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion. my interest in international cinema has expanded since i first saw this film. i recommend it to anyone (any adult... don't let the inclusion of the young children fool you into thinking it's a family film) who love comedy - even those unfamiliar with the language.
