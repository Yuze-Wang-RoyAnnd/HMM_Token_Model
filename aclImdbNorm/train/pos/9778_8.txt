this is a trio of tales, "shakti", "devi", and "kali", about an experimental commune (or some such thing) called the taylor-eriksson group, which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown, and left a bit of damage here and there, i'd say. many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself. shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man that may not have existed. seems this woman is able to project some inner demon, or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin". he's a skinhead, a speed freak, and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this commune, which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire. this is probably the best of the three segments. kali tells the tale of a healer, who attempts to "heal" this woman who was a part of this commune and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman, but one wonders if he did it or if she loosed it because it could not survive in her any longer. all three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect, and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the strangeness. this has a sort of low-budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout, much to its credit. i watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares (and gore) came it hit pretty hard. i found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot. a good little find, this one, i'd give it 8 out of 10.
