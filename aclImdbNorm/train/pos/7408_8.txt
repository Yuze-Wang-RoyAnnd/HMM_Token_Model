i had the privilege to see this movie at the intenational film festival of rotterdam.<br /><br />'xizhao' or 'shower' is a $200.000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons. the father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional chinese village where local, mostly aged men, come to relax and to go bathing. the father has to sons: a 'retarded' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him. to this son the traditional village, the bathhouse and his 'retarded' brother seem strange and annoying, but this changes along the movie.<br /><br />though the story may sound cheesy or cliche, it's not. with really great performances, especially of the father and the 'retarded' son (sorry, i don't know their names) and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time.<br /><br />if you got a chance to see this movie do it. it's a great alternative to mainstream hollywood cinema.<br /><br />
