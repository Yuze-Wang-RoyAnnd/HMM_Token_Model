what a fun movie experience! i was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that i enjoyed it more than my teens. take a tissue, it's not sad, just 'moving' in parts. finally, its a 'feel good' flick for the whole family. note: it's 2+ hours, so consider leaving the littlest 'squirmers' home for this one. ap
