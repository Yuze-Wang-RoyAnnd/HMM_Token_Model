criminals perry smith and richard "dick" hickock believe mr. clutter of holcomb, kansas keeps a large supply of cash on-hand in a safe.on november 15, 1959 at two a.m. they end up murdering mr. and mrs. clutter and their teenage son and daughter.after a little police investigation the two men are found and sentenced to be hanged.in cold blood (1967) is directed by richard brooks.now, i haven't read the truman capote novel this movie is based on, so i can't make any comparisons.the movie does a brilliant job telling of those horrific events that actually took place.robert blake is excellent as perry.of course, blake had the murder case of his own a few years back, being accused of murdering his wife.he's free now, but we still don't know the truth.what ever that may be, he's still a very fine actor.scott wilson does remarkable job as hickock.john forsythe is terrific as alvin dewey.paul stewart is very good as jensen.jeff corey is marvelous as mr. hickock.same thing with charles mcgraw who plays tex smith.john mcliam portrays herbert clutter, ruth storey is his wife bonnie, brenda currin is the daughter nancy and paul hough is the son kenyon.great job by each of them.there is much to remember from this film.let's start from the lighter side.it's pretty great when perry wants to go hunting for gold in mexico and says to hickock: remember bogart in treasure of the sierra madre?" and blake himself was in that movie as a boy! and it's a fun moment when they, giving a ride to that boy and his granddad, collect bottles and turn them in for refund money.those darker moments are the most haunting ones.the flashback sequence, where you see the murders happening, is extremely terrifying.when perry goes to kill the girl, nancy last, and she says "oh, please, don't"...the brutality of man, it's impossible to explain.then the hanging scene.first there goes hickock and then perry, first talking to the minister.in the last image of the movie we see perry hitting the end of the rope.sure movies,and books may try to sympathize these villains.especially perry's character is someone you could feel sorry for.he thinks of his mom, and dad who he hates, but still loves.but it doesn't change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers, who don't feel sorry for anybody.they go to this house and murder an entire family, in cold blood.how could you sympathize these people?
