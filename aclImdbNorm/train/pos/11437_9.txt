one of the most unheralded great works of animation. though it makes the most sophisticated use of the "cut-out" method of animation (a la "south park"), the real talent behind "twice upon a time" are the vocal characterizations, with lorenzo music's (carlton from tv's "rhoda") woody allen-ish ralph-the-all-purpose-animal being the centerpiece. the "accidental nightmare" sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed.
