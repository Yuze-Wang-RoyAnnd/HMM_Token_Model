i haven't yet read the kurt vonnegut book this was adapted from, but i am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen. overall, i think this is a very successful adaptation of one of vonnegut's novels. it concerns the story of an american living in germany who is recruited as a spy for the us. his job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked nazi's and send secret messages to the american's via his weekly radio show. but when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to new york, where various odd plot twists await.<br /><br />if mother night has a problem it's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times. but for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb. and there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked nazi in a prison cell. very much recommended.
