in the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of 2004s innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls. the three principals, all unknown to me give very sure-footed performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so i wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. it would be nice if this could get away from the art houses and into the multiplexes where there's just an outside chance it might 'speak' to the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at.
