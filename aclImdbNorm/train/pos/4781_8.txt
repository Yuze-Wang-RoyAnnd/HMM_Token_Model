mulholland drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch. he's a modern genius, because he's not only a film-maker. his stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen. so the straight story was quite a surprise to me, with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets. still, lynch is there, and, while this is far from his best, it's a film not to be missed. late richard farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons.<br /><br />8/10
