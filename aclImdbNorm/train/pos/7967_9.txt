this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made. it's a real pleaser to anyone. it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll put you into suspense.<br /><br />basically, what homeward bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. they don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.<br /><br />this is one of the last movies that don ameche starred in. he provided the voice of shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy, the himalayan cat. but seriously, what this movie is all about is chance! voiced by michael j. fox (my all-time favorite actor), chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time i crack up when watching this movie, it's because of chance; it's like the comedy never ends! <br /><br />this movie is also very sad at times. it sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.<br /><br />one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound; i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. the movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.<br /><br />overall, it's a wonderful family movie. if you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel too. i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
