i have wanted to see this for the longest time, james merendino is a great director. slc punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though, it begins to drag. the acting and direction were terrific. in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script. at times, the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, claire forlani. this film was good, but i expected more.<br /><br />p.s. look for great cameos by chi mcbride, and chris mcdonald.
