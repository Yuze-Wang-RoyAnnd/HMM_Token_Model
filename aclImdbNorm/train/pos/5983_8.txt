i first saw this film as a teenager. it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world. trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks. with a cast that features skippy from family ties, gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher, how can you go wrong? backwards evil messages played on vinyl! yes thats right, they use records in this movie. in one scene eddie (skippy) is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary. monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed. as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine. almost 20 years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies.
