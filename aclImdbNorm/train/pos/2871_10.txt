comment? like my comment is necessary? we are talking about all time masterpiece, for all seasons and all generations. this is only type of movies that i still have patience to watch. in this, like in other disney's movies is some kind of magic. all characters are in some way, "alive" and "real" so it's easy to understand message, even if you don't understand language, (like i didn't understood when i first watched movie, because i was about six years old). maybe my english is not so good, but i learned what i know mostly from this kind of movies, and this is one more great dimension of this kind of movies, which in present time are rare. but there is a one big shame. in my country is now impossible to watch this, or any other disney's movie! we don't have copyrights, so our children are disabled to enjoy and learn from this kind of movies. so, we will watch this movie again "once upon a dream" or...?
