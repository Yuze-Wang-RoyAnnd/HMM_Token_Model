gentleman jim is another case of print the legend, with errol flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath. it's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in flynn's the charge of the light brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by raoul walsh's vivid direction. flynn is still at the height of his powers (you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with alexis smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick alan hale along for good measure, this time as flynn's father (jack carson takes sidekick duties this time). indeed, even the pirate galleon from flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout! the 103 minutes just breeze by.
