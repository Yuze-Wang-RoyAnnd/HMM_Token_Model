this is one powerful film. the first time i saw it, the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience. i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd, used the english subtitles when i needed them, and really got into this movie, discovering just how good it is. it is excellent.<br /><br />the widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts, with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart, an involving tale of good versus evil. here, it's liam neeson (good) vs. tim roth (evil). both do their jobs well.<br /><br />few actors come across as despicable as roth. man, you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant, irritating puss. (he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here). neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart. jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead. the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved, so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this.
