it is written in stone that disney animations simply ~must~ be musicals. right? where? show me. because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for ~not~ containing the hokey made-for-five-year-old standard disney musical fare. <br /><br />while the story was not as enthralling as it could have been, it was still quite good, enjoyable, and adventurous. i had hoped for a bit more, yes, considering the subject matter, but this movie is ~not~ the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be. <br /><br />the animation quality is average, but the dialog is quite compelling, as is the story line, plot, sub-plot, and amazing creativity i found within this production. i will refrain from outlining the plot, as it has been done and done, but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy.<br /><br />this is, in my opinion, the best disney animated feature length film.<br /><br />it rates a 9.4/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
