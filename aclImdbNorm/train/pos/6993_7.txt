this is not bela lagosi's best movie, but it's got a good old style approach for some 40's horror entertainment.<br /><br />brides are dropping dead at the altar like flies. i think i'd postpone the wedding until after the fiend is caught, but it's a horror movie, so i guess people ignore the danger for some reason. anyway, lagosi is a mad doctor, who needs young female blood to keep his aging, sickly wife healthy and happy. he always eludes the keystone cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse (who would think of looking for a corpse in a hearse?), and the brides just keep on getting zapped.<br /><br />no movie like this would be complete without a lois lane type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own. good at solving crime, bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times, guess who lagosi picks for his next intended victim. i love the "haunted house" bit where lois lane gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at lagosi's sinister mansion. hidden passageways, a vampire-like wife, an evil dwarf igor assistant, and so on. good stuff.<br /><br />fairly well done pacing keeps the film moving, and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying manner. if you like old horror movies, this one is worth a watch.
