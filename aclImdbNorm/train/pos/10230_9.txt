people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs- congo, king kong vs. godzilla, king kong (1976), they all ripoff one another, but yeti stands on its own. it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal's attraction with one female.<br /><br />the yeti myth is based on bigfoot (not like king kong)and archeologists have been fascinated it, at one time they did exist,but there is no scientific data to prove it.<br /><br />this movie is hard to find ,but its worth watching it. the first time i watched it was on "elvira's mistress of the dark shows" in the early 1980's. it sent chills down my spine as a kid, especially when the yeti got mad. i saw it again, around 1:00am on abc about 2 to 3yrs ago. seeing it again made me appreciate it more, it has some overall good effects (for its time) and the story involves a mute boy and his dog, and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes. also the music is pretty cool,its very yeti like. :-)<br /><br />gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere.<br /><br />vote 7 and half out of 10.
