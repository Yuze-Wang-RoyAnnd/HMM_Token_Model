although i agree that it's a good but not great movie, for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned, i still enjoy it. one reason is the music: i'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the candoli brothers -- conte and pete -- in a well-staged scene in the nightclub. these guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day, and they manage to convincingly boggle the mind of jimmy stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet duet, one trumpet in each of stewart's ears. the candolis really did play that well, too, though i suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them. i don't know much about george duning, who gets the credit for the music (other than that he seems to have worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion), but the casting of the candoli brothers as jazz-playing warlocks was a real nice touch.
