okay, here's what i think about jack frost. i looked at the morphing box for the vhs tape and i thought to myself, this looks interesting. i rent it and i take it home. boy was i right, it is interesting. they put serial killer's spirits in dreams, in walking corpses and inside every day machines. but this has got to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. inside the body of a snowman. i liked all the friendly snowman images littering the landscape, the pot holder, the snow globe, etc. i like the actor who played jack, he put some fun into a killer really not seen since freddy krugger. that's right, i said it. freddy krugger. it's that level of "cool". i wish some of the puppet effects were better, the mouth movements could have matched better. but i chalk that up to a small budget. the cast does a great job, there are some great one liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump. all and all, a great story, good effects, great dialog and a great cast. i give jack frost...9 stars
