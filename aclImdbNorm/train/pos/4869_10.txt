not for people without swift mind or without a drop of balkan blood in their veins. if you don't have any of these you can not understand it. and if you don't understand, you can't enjoy it. :) for example if you think picasso is a name of a car produced by citroen, probably if you see a picasso's painting you just will walk by it, deciding that it's a trash-work of some street painter. :) so do not judge, before trying to understand it :) in the end i think it's a must for every one with open minds. still my n1 remains the shawshank redemption! and remember that not all things can be put in frames. because there are things in this world, that any frame just won't fit.
