while i would say i enjoy the show, i expected something completely different from when i first saw 'what i like about you' i expected to find something along the lines of 'all that' (i am not sure if it is going on anymore) but i have to say i do like the show and while i don't classify it as a breakthrough show, it is very charming and i do like the chemistry between the characters as well (including the supporting cast)<br /><br />i would definitely say that it is great to see wesley jonathan back on the screen because i really loved him in city guy. i had also seen the woman who plays valerie's friend in popular and while i think that was an okay show, i do not really like her character in this show because she's just not my cup of tea but she rounds it out pretty well
