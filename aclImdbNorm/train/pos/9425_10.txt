a super comedy series from the 1990s (two series were made in total) that suffered in the uk ratings due to poor scheduling. when you are up against established comedies like 'minder', even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticed.<br /><br />luckily, i caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly. i mentioned it to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to have been watching something else. very, very frustrating.<br /><br />anyway, i loved both series and never forgot it.<br /><br />then i looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra-fan was trying to get both series released 'on his own'.<br /><br />well, both series are now available on dvd.<br /><br />http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_s1.htm
