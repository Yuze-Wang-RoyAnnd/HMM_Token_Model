i saw this film premiere friday (1/19) night in park city for sundance and was incredibly moved. sitting in a theater and hearing first-hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than i could bear. others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away, the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us. robert acosta, paul rieckhoff, sean huze, and herold noel, all veterans of the war in iraq and featured in the film, were present. while they may be home now, you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be. whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker. see this film!
