in loving memory of david tomlinson (1917-2000)<br /><br />when i watched this movie for the first time i was 4 years old and i got fascinated by this story of witches in the 2nd world war. the scene, which impressed me the most, was the fight between the nazi soldiers and the medieval army. it was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march. this movie is fantastic, from the trip to portobello road (which became to me the most fantastic place of london) to the journey to naboomboo. angela lansbury and david tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. she is always great, it seems the good aunt of a family and david with his always astonished face is her great co-protagonist. we'll miss him a lot.
