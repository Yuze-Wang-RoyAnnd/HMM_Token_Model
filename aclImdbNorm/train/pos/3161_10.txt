i actually didn't start watching the show until it came on fx. i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it. i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on t.v. i loved the show so much!finally a show for everyone to enjoy. i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough. they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid, but not that 70s show. that 70s show was hilarious, smart and so real. i think it was the best show ever made and i'm very sorry that it ended. although i love this show, i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and kelso leave. the last season was just not right, eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves. i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one.
