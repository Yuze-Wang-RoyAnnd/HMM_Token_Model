i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever. when i watched valentine, i was amazed at how great the story line actually was. it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all. the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning. some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor, and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring, but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful. it had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets. i recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on valentine's day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills. oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer or rating, please, don't...
