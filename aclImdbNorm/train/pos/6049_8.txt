freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy, gang caper, "stoner" film and feel-good british movie.<br /><br />it is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre. stars phil daniels, gary stretch and geoff bell have a great chemistry and make their characters hugely likable and realistic. the main story centres around their road trip from london to wales, and the adventures and mishaps that occur along the way. this small film also has a great heart - it is not just for bike fans, as it bases around the character's relationships with each other including dreams and regrets, such as gary stretch's fred longing for the family he left behind. the cinematography is also great - a love letter to the welsh countryside as well as capturing the grittiness of london streets and typical pub life in the welsh country towns.<br /><br />stylish, slick, fantastic soundtrack, likable characters and funny storyline - i would recommend freebird in a heartbeat!
