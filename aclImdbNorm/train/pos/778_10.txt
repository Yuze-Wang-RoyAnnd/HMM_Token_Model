i'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details, but this movie just hit me deep. i don't think i'll ever forget it. one scene especially (i think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one i am speaking) is imprinted on my brain.<br /><br />i also watched the similar movie lilja 4-ever (as referred to by a previous commentator). it was also very moving, but not quite as straight to the point and brutal. if you are sensitive at all, either will bring tears to your eyes, but anjos do sol (angels of the sun) may stay with you forever.<br /><br />this is very depressing subject matter, but i think, no, i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to it.<br /><br />more people need to see this film!!!!!!
