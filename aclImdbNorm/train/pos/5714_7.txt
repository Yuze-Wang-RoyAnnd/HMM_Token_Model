i was so excited to see this film because i had always heard it was very scary.<br /><br />what's interesting about it is that it is a japanese film they decided to bring to america, but they actually filmed it in japan with the original crew! i think this made the film... more japanese (which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most japan-to-america horror movie flops) but it also made it a bit inaccessible to american audiences. the difference in what scares the japanese culture and what scares the american culture felt present throughout the film. this worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, tokyo pond.<br /><br />the storyline was quite confusing as well. in typical japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. the beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until, at the end of the film, we see the ending and beginning of the whole story. this constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. also, i didn't think some things were explained so well and i had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story).<br /><br />overall, there is plenty for american audiences to love, tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes.
