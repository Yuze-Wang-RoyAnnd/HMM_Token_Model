i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that. the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies. so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little. i'm 22 years old and the ending still gets to me. all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and i'm shocked honestly by this rating of 5.8, i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well. i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and fun.<br /><br />charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog, carface. but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that can't stop ticking or that's the end of his life again. when he and his best friend, itchy, look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money, he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races. charlie takes the girl, ann-marie, and makes fake promises in order to get the money. but he ends up learning that maybe he should put ann-marie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeance.<br /><br />all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film, it's not disney, but this is an excellent family film to watch. not to mention that it's just so cute and touching. i know it's ridicules and some people call me crazy, but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls. how could they not? they're just so loving, and i think i'm going to cry again. but anyways, i would just recommend this movie for anyone, it's a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />7/10
