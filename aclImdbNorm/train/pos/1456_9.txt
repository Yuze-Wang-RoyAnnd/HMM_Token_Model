documentaries of this kind are often very opinionated. this film seems to take all opinions out and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. it is sad the conditions these poor people have to work in, this film does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops. the film mardi gras: made in china was a good way of showing the world how something as petty as beads for a celebration can effect the lives of so many people in another country.<br /><br />i had to watch this film for an english class where we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this film helped get the topic rolling. it was a great, very informative movie and i'd recommend anyone see it, it kinda opens your eyes.
