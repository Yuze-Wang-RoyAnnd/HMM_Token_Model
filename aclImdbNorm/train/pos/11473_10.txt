zero day is a film few people have gotten to see, and what a shame that is.<br /><br />when i saw the end, where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people, then commit suicide, and it made me grab my stomach. i was shaking, that's how strong this movie is.<br /><br />the movie is amazing. it's too incredible not to get a perfect ten. it's sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film. it is not a budget which makes a film good, it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it good.<br /><br />it leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply cannot get out. it makes you realise the true horror of shootings- especially if you were to know that person, and this movie makes you feel like you know these people.<br /><br />i recommend zero hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it. i am fourteen, and i feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words. it feels like you're watching something that actually happened.
