this made-for-tv film is a brilliant one. this is probably the best and favourite role by bafta winning john thaw (kavanagh q.c. and inspector morse). tom oakley (thaw) widowed man has lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died, and now he has been landed with an evacuee called willaim beech (nick robinson). as he gets to know this child he starts to develop a friendship. until willaim's mum (annabelle apsion) wants him back. after tom gets worried about william not contacting him he goes to london to find him. in the end willaim gets his home with a loving family (or dad). set during the second world war this is an excellent film. it was nominated the bafta lew grade award, and it won the national television award for most popular drama. john thaw was number 3 on tv's 50 greatest stars. very good!
