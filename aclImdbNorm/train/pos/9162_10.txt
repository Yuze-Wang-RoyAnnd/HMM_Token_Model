though i did not begin to read the "classics" in literature until i was 47, it's never too late. jane eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there isn't a part of the book i liked less, only parts i enjoyed more. the 1983 tv mini-series with zelah clarke and timothy dalton was everything i hoped it would be. i saw it as a full length movie in 2006. dalton's 'mr. rochester' was very good but i absolutely loved zelah's 'jane eyre'. relecting on another 'classics' movie i saw recently, i was disappointed in the production, direction and dialogue. it was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of hollywood. artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism. using the title after such license is fraud. leave it to the brits to get this one right (among others). you won't be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it's proper context and spirit. well done bbc.
