"spaced invaders" is one of the funniest movies, i've ever seen. i don't understand, why this movie didn't get better critics, it's funny, harmless and sweet. i first watched it, when i was 11, and i really fell in love with it... 2 days later, i got it on vhs :-p till today, i've shown it to many friends, and they all liked it, but nobody knew the movie before. i think, that's the problem, nearly nobody knows it, so nearly nobody can like it... this movie never got a real chance, that's sad, "si" has really the potential of a comedy like "monsters inc." or "spaceballs". ok, enough displeasure - what i really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh your head off, watch it! even if you don't get mad about it, it's worth watching! --> prepare to laugh, earth scum!
