1933 seemed to be a great year for satires ("duck soup" for instance) and this one fits in well even though it is about the obsession with contract bridge. the tone is like a humorous piece from the new yorker, appropriate, since the film begins with the "goings on about town" page of that magazine. the only thing odd is the casting. made a few years later william powell and myrna loy would have been perfect. however, after 1934, you wouldn't have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion, the young and beautiful loretta young in some shear and slinky outfits, or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on radio. even if you know nothing about bridge, you may still want to check out a rare example of hollywood satire.
