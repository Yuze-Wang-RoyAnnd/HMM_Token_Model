although i've long been a fan of peter weir, i hadn't watched any of his australian movies until i watched the last wave. and it was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise.<br /><br />richard chamberlain plays david, a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another aborigine. for david's peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence. but david believes there's a mystery underneath the murder, linked to tribal rituals. as his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself too.<br /><br />to reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies i've ever seen. i can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting.<br /><br />there are many elements that make this a fascinating movie: chamberlain's acting, for instance; but also the performances by david gulpilil, who plays a young aborigine who introduces david into tribal mysteries; and nandjiwarra amagula, who plays an old aborigine who's a spiritual guide. the relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie.<br /><br />but there's also the way weir suggests the supernatural in the movie. david has dreams that warn him of the future. australia is undergoing awful weather, with storms, hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution. but it's also related to the case david is defending. how it's related is one of the great revelations of the movie. out of little events weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression, suggesting future horrors without really showing anything.<br /><br />charles wain's score is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo. the photography is also quite good. russell boyd, weir's longtime dp who won an oscar in 2004 for master and commander, depicts a dark, creepy world full of mystery.<br /><br />i also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines, it doesn't turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions, like dances with wolves or the last samurai. this movie is too clever to be that simplistic.<br /><br />sometimes it can be frustrating, and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense; but for those who don't mind some strangeness or ambiguity, the last wave is a great movie to watch.
