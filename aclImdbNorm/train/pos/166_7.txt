this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more. crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. they have never worked before and the brother, william bakewell, gets a job with gable, who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick. crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on. their is a massacre in which several of gable's men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing. it's a good movie but not one of their best.
