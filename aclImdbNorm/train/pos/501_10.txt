i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet, i say potential.. we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas... but i hope not! for those that have not seen it..see it! without that annoying "prime directive" floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool.. and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain, and the vulcan babe is hot too, (check out the decontamination scene)i gave this a full 10... it blows away all the other series openers.. i hope this goes longer than 7 years...
