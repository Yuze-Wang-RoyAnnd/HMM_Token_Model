the film was very outstanding despite the nc-17 rating and disturbing scenes. in reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it. it all starts with maya (rosario dawson in superb performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her. she meets jared (chad faust in a terrific performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. he invites her out to dinner. they look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. they talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other. she tries to put an end to it, but he rapes her. this incident scars her. she goes to a club meets a bartender/dj adrian (greatfully played by marcus patrick) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far. they strike a friendship. he also does drugs and maya starts using as well. in other words introduces her to a different world. she starts going back to school and working as ta (teaching assistant) and spots jared as one of the students. while the students are taking a midterm, she catches jared cheating. jared tries to smooth talk maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. will history repeat itself? or will maya have a surprise for jared? you watch the movie. excellent a. rosario dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance. chad faust does not like he can be a rapist, but he does a terrific job as jared. marcus patrick is very brilliant the man who saves maya and coaches her into a new world. this film deserves an award.
