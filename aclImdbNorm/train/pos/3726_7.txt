i wasn't expecting the highest calibre of film-making with joel schumacher directing this one, so i was surprised that tigerland wasn't a complete waste of time.<br /><br />in technique, it's often derivative of saving private ryan with the shaky camera work, grainy shots, the film occasionally running like it's skipping a sprocket---all those techniques speilberg used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end was more distracting than anything else.<br /><br />but unlike saving private ryan, the emotional component wasn't as weak, as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and the story less contrived, not so wrapped up in the american flag (speilberg gets an 'f' in subtlety).<br /><br />next to the first section of kubrick's full metal jacket, this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp that i have seen in a film, and for that i think it's worth watching.<br /><br />it's not a great film, but neither is it a bad film.
