with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity, this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene. the movie plays much like a dream, and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it. characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless. but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices. the film works isn't trying to work as history, but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies. <br /><br />i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie, but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away. this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever, and there is a wild imagination in its style. i can completely understand why people would hate it, but i give it 9/10.
