home room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life. it keeps you wanting to see more. wondering what the secret alicia is hiding. i think i watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. plus i usually don't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time. i wish i could find more movies like that one. all in all i thought it was a great movie. the more you watch of it the more you become part of it. the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. my heart felt as if it had shattered just then. and how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. i loved it so much.
