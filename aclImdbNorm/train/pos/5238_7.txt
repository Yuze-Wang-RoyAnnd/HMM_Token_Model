i liked top gun. it held my interest. predictable plot, decent character development and story line. it is pretty similar to high noon in that the town people appear weak and scared to stand up to a villain. this movie has some quality actors who really did not get a chance to share all of their talents. also some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles. denver pyle was a good looking man in his younger days. john dehner, rod taylor are outstanding in their roles. sterling hayden did the best that he could with poor material. it is hard to imagine him as a gunslinger. laura, played by karen booth, was a nauseating character. she seemed flattered that two men may have been fighting over her. ugh. finally, how can people travel without luggage? especially women.
