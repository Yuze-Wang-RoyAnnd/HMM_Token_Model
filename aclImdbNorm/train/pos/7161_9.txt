loved the movie. loved the two families crossing paths in history. only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue? he is madame zeroni's son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children? hmmmmmmmmm. never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher? maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit? even with the mistakes in the movie. just loved it. the acting was great. not sure where the story was with mr. sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier. the other "counseler" did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much. poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up.
