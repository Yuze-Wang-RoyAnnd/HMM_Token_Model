i have very fond memories of this film, as i saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in 1977 and i was eight years old. apparently it was deemed a failure - and is now practically forgotten (the pan-and scan videocassette - which never did justice to the picture or it's ambitious panavision compositions is now out-of -print.) the film is very stylized (shades of yellow submarine) and admittedly uneven. some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished. the sad discarded blue camel (shades of eeyore) and his blue song are truly heartwarming. joe raposo's songs are for the most part simply beautiful. definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably (sadly) fall into total obscurity.
