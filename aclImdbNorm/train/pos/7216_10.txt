no one better spoil this piece of work! awesome movie! written expertly by the likes of ira levin and depicted with the best performance of christopher reeve's career and one of caine's very best, this is simply excellent. i wish i could catch a staged version somewhere...maybe someday i will. i hope this grossly underrated, overlooked film has not become too difficult to locate because it a 'must' for any hitchcockian, agatha-phile or lover of great film. one of very few movies i couldn't instantly solve or predict and worth a second or even third viewing, "deathtrap" gets a 9/10 and earns every iota of it. we need and deserve more movies like this!
