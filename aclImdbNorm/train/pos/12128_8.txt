i just saw "of human bondage" for the first time a few days ago and wow! what a mysterious and almost spooky film. i loved how the music went with the pace of each step of philip's feet. it gave me the chills for some reason...<br /><br />one of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see bette davis coming into herself right before your eyes. she's great, not necessarily because this is her best work, but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious, gritty, and unflinching as an actress in 1934... bette was a risk taker, always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it. if you're a true lover of film, it's amazing to see...<br /><br />she just had a way of delivering a line that made the part, and the film for that matter, belong to her. like "a mass of music and fire. that's me...an old kazoo and some sparklers" or "but you are blanche, you are in that chair!" or "with all my heart, i still love the man i killed!!"... those are from a few of her films, but you get my drift. she was just so brave, sassy, and exotic looking with those beautiful big eyes. after seeing this, i can't believe it was remade twice...<br /><br />leslie howard was gorgeous...so calm and persistent, needing to be loved. i thought he was adorable and couldn't understand how everyone wasn't falling for him, but then again, everyone was...except mildred. he did a great job...<br /><br />the only thing that i didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early films. they'd make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place. the performances were great, but in real life, philip would have never been interested in mildred. that's just the simple truth... see it!!
