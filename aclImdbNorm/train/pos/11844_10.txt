i began riding horses fairly recently, and, as anyone who has ever ridden should know, i fell in love with horses and their world. i rented spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as i could, and i was surprised by the results.<br /><br />what i expected was a feel-good disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes.<br /><br />what i got was an amazing film, filled with beautiful scenery and animation, and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one's heart.<br /><br />spirit is a wild mustang in the old west, whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland. the story unfolds with a wide array of characters, some human, some animals, all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen.<br /><br />i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story, and who has an appreciation for history and animals.<br /><br />one thing i forgot to mention, but that i feel is important, is that the animals in this film do not talk. this was a really nice vacation from the lady and the tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to.
