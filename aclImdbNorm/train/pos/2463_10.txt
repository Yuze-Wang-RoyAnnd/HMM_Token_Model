william shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play. not only is it the best movie version of it, but it's also the only complete version of hamlet. kenneth branagh's hamlet is simply genius. not only because it was written by shakespeare, but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing, even if it went just over four hours.<br /><br />we all know the story of the prince of denmark and his plot to avenge his father's death, so i won't go into the details of the story. i will, however, tell you that the best part of this hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography, but the actors' interpretations of each character. i doubt you'll find a better polonius than richard briers' delicious portrayal. plus, you can't go wrong with julie christie and jack lemmon. also, derek jacobi, a regular among shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to hamlet.<br /><br />of course, we must talk about kenneth branagh. he wowed audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with shakespeare, henry v. he outdoes himself with hamlet. sure, olivier's presence was captivating, but i think branagh's performance is wonderful. when you watch him on screen, it's almost as if he knew exactly how shakespeare wanted the role to be played. how he wasn't nominated for an oscar is a total mystery. at least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for screenplay. i guess they know good writing when they see it though. <br /><br />all in all, you'll never find a more rich and lavish production of the bard's best play. to say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement. if you love this play and are a fan of shakespeare, you definitely need to check this movie out. even if you don't really care for shakespeare, the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film. you may not think you'll be able to sit through all of it at once, but you'll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more.
