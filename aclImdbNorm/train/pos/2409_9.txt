this movie has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness, but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues. one of these is the nature and character of the relationship between jesus and judas. another is that of the historical nature of the bible and faith. and third, is the humanity of jesus. the tension of the christ-betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie. judas' passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of christ. when judas takes his own life, the viewer can sense the angst. peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not as powerfully portrayed as the judas drama. chris sarandon offers a novel and provocative christ, whether believable or not. i would like to find this movie on dvd or even vhs, to use in study or discussion groups.
