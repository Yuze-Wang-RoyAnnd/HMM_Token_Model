i instantly fell in love with "pushing daisies". this show manages to put a smile on my face with it's great storytelling, witty dialog and great acting. but that's not all: it also manages to keep you until the end. the basic idea behind the show - bringing people back to life with one touch, ending the undead status with a second - is interesting and could still be in later seasons. but the suspenseful murder cases, the unique look of the show and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience. but "pushing daisies" is more than it's parts. it has a certain charm that i really enjoy and i'm looking forward to enter the world of ned and chuck for a second season.
