luckily, not knowing anything about this movie i was curious enough to tape it from tv. and then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!<br /><br />but i'm glad i managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. there are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots, but also very chilling and even daring moments. considering the production year 1969, the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. and it's not just because of the two george's actresses.<br /><br />the gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly, no wonder, and it certainly did hit me. very effective. also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action. this is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side, but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. well, being a case of war, mostly bad.<br /><br />for the fans of composer ennio morricone this is also a must. his work is always excellent, touching but never over the top. and i think i have to try to catch more movies with suzy kendall. talk about fr"aulein! let's hope they get this on dvd soon, so i can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem.
