it's rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to watch a particular programme. it's even rarer when i actually enjoy the programme in the end, but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies i think i've seen.<br /><br />a remarkable cast, led by dame judi dench and ian holm, and an excellent, witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience. i can't really express how good i thought it was, so i won't try, i'll just say, if you get the opportunity, please see it!!!! i only hope it comes out on video.
