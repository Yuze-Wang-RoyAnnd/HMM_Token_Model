road to perdition, a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year oscars is the second work of sam mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years before won oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial american beauty. this is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.<br /><br />it's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of depression when the, michael sullivan, a father of two children, played by great tom hanks (i'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by paul newman. his eldest son, a thirteen years boy michael sullivan jr., perfectly played by young tyler hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by john rooney, son of his father boss. such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. the atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. but the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. they are shown so deeply, strong and believable. tom hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. finally worth to mention a very nice score by paul newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece. i believe road to perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />my grade 10 out of 10
