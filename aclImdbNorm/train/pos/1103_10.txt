this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film! the plot is somewhat lacking, but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference. this is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please. as a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining; and with major stars like cary grant, myrna loy, and melvyn douglas... how could you go wrong? <br /><br />comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued, and is very difficult to imitate. a good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film: the money pit, with tom hanks and shelley long. despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments. achieving true comedic dialog is an art.
