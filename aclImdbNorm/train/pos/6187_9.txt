there are moments in the film that are so dreadful, your teeth ache. but knowing that there were only weeks left before the code made movies innocuous and bland, paramount rushed this into production before innuendo and leering went out of style. vanities is so horrifically anti-female that it's delicious. as kitty carlisle sings, women are displayed with price tags that would insult a bronx hooker. they emerge from clams (nudge,nudge;wink,wink) in postures of absolute submission. minions of the law, so stupid they cannot find the door, get to look up their skirts and snicker. bare-breasted chorus girls sit uncomfortably in giant cacti (could they be a source of hallucinogens, perhaps?) while we listen to "sweet marijuana" and watch as blood falls on a chorines's breast.<br /><br />sure, carl brisson learned his lines phonetically and doesn't seem to have a clue what he is saying. but it's all worth it as norma steals the show while no one is looking.<br /><br />taking one moment of this fragile fluff seriously is missing the point of the whole exercise. watch this with a charter member of now and prepare to justify the whole hollywood machismo sch tick between body blows.<br /><br />toby wing, by the way, is the icing on the cake. and duke ellington doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />a must stroll down memory lane.
