this was a marvelously funny comedy with a great cast. john ritter and katey sagal were perfectly cast as the parents, and the kids were great too. kaley cuoco was a good choice to play bridget, who was sort of a toned-down version of kelly bundy from married with children. the writing and performances were both first-rate.<br /><br />sadly, john ritter died during the series, and it put a damper on things. they had to scramble to change the show and bring in more cast members, and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation, but they handled it well. james garner was a good addition. it could have lasted longer had ritter lived.<br /><br />i especially loved it when they brought in ed o'neill in a guest spot. that was great.<br /><br />*** out of ****
