full marks for pacino's rendering of the speech over the dead kid's coffin; shakespeare's mark antony would be put to shame!!<br /><br />was it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues? they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts. i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice-over postscript.<br /><br />there is little else to talk about in this film; even john cusack has done better roles than this one. interestingly, the film is very male oriented--the women are mere appendages.
