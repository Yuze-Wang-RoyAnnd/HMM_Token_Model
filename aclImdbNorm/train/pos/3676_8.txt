i took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making. i always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies, especially as i'm such a cynic myself. it's good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who hasn't yet reached the "been there, done that" approach to every movie she sees. i'm pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother / daughter evening out. far, far better than going to see some brain dead "chick flick", which i gather is what we are supposed to enjoy, according to the demographics? <br /><br />eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of paris, a city i haven't visited in 20 years. but i wish i had. they are loosely linked by joining shots, and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world. some of the films work better than others but, as other reviewers have said, it never descends too far into kitsch. some are funny, some are sad, some intriguing and some just plain puzzling (i'm still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the "flying tiger, hidden dragon" hairdressing salon.) some are just fun and perhaps shouldn't be assigned too much meaning (the vampire and the tourist for example.) possibly my only criticism of the whole film, is that it makes paris look too good. it can also be cold, wet, foggy, indifferent and miserable, or, in summer, baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction. but i'm nit picking. <br /><br />my personal favourite by far was the coen brothers film shot on the tuileries metro station, and starring a perfectly cast steve buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers' tiff. absolutely perfect, and very, very funny, without buscemi having to say a word. i also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists, which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy - that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch, but it just stayed on the right side. rufus sewell and emily mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with oscar wilde's tomb left me pretty indifferent, and juliette binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very, very uncomfortable. i thought both the bob hoskins / fanny ardent piece, and ben gazzara / gena rowlands fell a bit flat, but maggie gyllenhaal was good (has she cornered the market in junkies? i watched sherry baby last week.) <br /><br />but i felt the two "social justice" pieces (for want of a better way of putting it), worked very well. by that, i mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone else's baby across town. and then the film about the african migrant, struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society, who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young, new paramedic. yet another murder statistic, in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life, every year. i thought both pieces very well observed.<br /><br />the final film, 14th arrondissement, in which margo martindale plays a postal worker from colorado recounting the story of her first trip to paris
