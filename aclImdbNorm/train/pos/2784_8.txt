nagra comes from conservative indian family that isn't exactly into girls playing competitive soccer. but our attractive young star can play some serious soccer. rhys-meyers coaches nagra and encourages her to perform, while knightley is supportive teammate and friend. when sis' wedding is scheduled for the same day as the ultimate soccer match, what's a girl to do? similar in its own unique way to bfgw as nagra tries to push the envelope on traditional family ways. here it's dad (well-played by kher) who can see both sides of the issue. docked an entire point for a hokey late sexual preference non-crisis, if they needed filler they could have gone elsewhere. nice final wrap up to the whole deal.
