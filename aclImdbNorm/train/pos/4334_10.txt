who wouldn't want to go on road trip with peter falk? that guy's right eye has more character than most actors today. this is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores. women are going to love it for all the wake-up romance advice for men, and men will love it for its spot-on father/son character study--one great little scene after another. and it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. obviously this is a labor of love for paul reiser who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. the most fun part, though, was watching reiser watch falk. you could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying peter falk's special craft. really delightful. let's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with paul reiser and folks.
