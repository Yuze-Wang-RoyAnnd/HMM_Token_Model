i found about the movie "holes" by hearing from people that it wasn't typical disney, that both kids and adults both got into the story. folks, let me tell you i wasn't disappointed. "holes" is based on the novel by louis sachar and follows the adventure of stanley yelnats, a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert. he befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives. it was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. i didn't know quite what to expect when i watched it. it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle. the boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr. sir. now that i've seen the movie, i have to read the book. most recommended!
