terrific film with a slightly slow start - give it a chance to get cooking. story builds in interest and complexity. characters and story line subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments. superb new york city locations - gritty, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "sex in the city" - in fact, the entire film is an antidote to the hbo/hollywood notion of new york city , sex and relationships. it's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. loved it! great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi, rosario dawson, and her love interest (forgot his name!).
