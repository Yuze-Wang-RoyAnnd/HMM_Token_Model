i first saw this at a foreign film festival. it's a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. it's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated baltic states beautifully (note: tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when i was there).<br /><br />there's a lot of humor and some romance, too. i don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises, so i'll just say this heist film starts from a great script, and the directing and performances are top notch. darkness in tallin is simply the fastest and most nerve-racking example of its genre --- i'd put it up against rafifi, topkapi, and it's miles ahead of the new ocean's 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy. rent or buy it now.
