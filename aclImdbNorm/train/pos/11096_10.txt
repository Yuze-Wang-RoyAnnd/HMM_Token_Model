based on elmore leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action film. the story: a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals. roy schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit's got to go to john glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath. i must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action film. also features some beautiful and sexy women - most notable are kelly preston as the young bate for schieder's character. vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers. i'm glad to say that ann-margaret still hasn't lost it - this lady is a true babe. don't look at the rate of this film. i really don't know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under-rated film. you will enjoy it, that's a promise. recommended a+.
