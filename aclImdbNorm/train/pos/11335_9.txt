jake's closet has the emotional power of kramer vs. kramer combined with the imagination of pan's labyrinth. even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to pan's labyrinth. but this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today. jake's closet is about a boy, an only child, practically alone on summer vacation, dealing with his family falling apart. it's a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense, a horror movie for the thinking person. if you're looking for a slasher movie, this won't be your cup of tea but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting, this is the movie for you. at the screening i saw, i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed. i highly recommend catching this film.
