noni hazlehurst, colin friels, alice garner, chrissie amphlett and michael caton- what more could you ask for? monkey grip based on the prize winning novel of the same name explores nora (hazlehurst, a single mother falling for a heroin addict jobe (friels). a simple story is made truly extraordinary through the all round magnificent acting (in particular noni hazlehurst) and nice use of the small budget. the only flaw is (if you can pick it up) is that the story is set in melbourne, although for budget reasons, the film was mainly shot in sydney, so as a result, in a few scenes you see trams (melbourne scenes) and then a carlton post office (sydney scenes). other than that, "monkey grip" is a must see (excuse the clique, but it is) at least for an award winning performance from former "play school" and "better homes & gardens" presenter noni hazlehurst.<br /><br />10/10
