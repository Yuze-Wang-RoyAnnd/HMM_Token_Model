this is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television. season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons. the only reason that i give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season. the only good part of the final season was the finale. my favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to people's imaginations, often depicting the characters in famous tv shows or movies from the 70's. it is a rare show in that i liked every character (with the exception of the final season...too late to try to develop a new character and fez wasn't nearly as funny). red's foot in your ass comments never got old, nor did kelso's stupidity. bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long, too long even.
