don't read anything about this movie (especially nothing that could contain any spoilers). just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a really great experience. if you like to see an intelligent, twisted story: go, get the dvd and you'll truly not be disappointed. "cypher" is not really a sci-fi movie, more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business. it's about corporate secrets, how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them. the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness. cypher is much deeper, more complex and - what belongs the story and the ending - also much, much more satisfying than vincenzo natali's other movies "cube" and "nothing". actually it's one of the best movies i've ever seen (and that's something i really don't say this about every fifth well-made flick). sorry, can't tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience. just give it a chance. ;-)
