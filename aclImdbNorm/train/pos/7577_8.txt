who's got the gold? is (unfortunately) the last of the hanzo the razor films, starring shintaro katsu as the title character - the multi-weapon proficient, authority-bucking samurai officer with the "unique" technique of raping confessions out of unwilling female informants until they "spill the beans" and beg for more...<br /><br />this entry starts with hanzo "uncovering" a woman who poses as a ghost to guard a lake that's filled with bamboo trunks filled with gold stolen from the treasury. this leads to hanzo discovering a loan-sharking scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk. the requisite swordplay and rape/interrogation ensue - finalizing in a decent ending for this strange trilogy of films.<br /><br />not quite as strong and enjoyable as the snare (part 2 of the series...), but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and japanese pinky-style films. 8/10
