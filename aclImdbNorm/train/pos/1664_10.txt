i thought this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi (artemisia gentileschi).<br /><br />cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch.<br /><br />although not each character was overtly beautiful, this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time.<br /><br />overall i thought this film was fantastic.
