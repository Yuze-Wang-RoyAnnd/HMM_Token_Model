my mom took me to see this movie when it came out around christmas of 1976. i loved it then and i love it now. i know everyone makes fun of barbra's hair in this one, but i think she looks and sounds great! ...and i seem to remember a number of women who copied that permed look at the time! also, the bath tub scene between streisand and kristoferson is just so sexy! the music is great as well. this is the groovy 70's babs at her best!
