i recently purchassed the very underrated dreamcast and went off into town to find some games to use them on. i bought soul calibur (a classic) and then i stepped across the domain of resident evil code veronica. i have resident evil 1 & 2, and have played res evil 3 numerous occasions, and i have been impressed with all of them, especially no.1 which has to go down in history has a classic.<br /><br />but none of them 3 come anywhere near to the dreamcast attempt of brilliant gory gameplay. if its just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort, ive never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me.<br /><br />anyway, the story carrys on from the 2nd story in which claire redfield searches for her brother (chris - from the 1st story), who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation. little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them 3 times in the previous storys.<br /><br />so aiding claire, with the assistant of super brat steve, u must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother. the 2nd cd enables you to control chris, thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear.<br /><br />the control are very slick and the movement of the characters are magnificently realistic, when the character notices danger, he/she faces the direction it is coming from. pure genius!!<br /><br />overall i gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year, game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop!!. please purchase this game as soon as possible.
