not so many people like the movies of bertrand blier simply because they don't understand them. simply because they are different kinds of people.<br /><br />if you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here.<br /><br />and also the film of blier cannot be classified easily as black-comedy or cult etc. like those of pulp fiction etc. because there is this delicacy which the audience of north-america frequently fail to appreciate.<br /><br />when i looked at these two `hooligans' dining with jeanne moreau in the seaside restaurant, i felt they were more gentil than any gentleman can have been.<br /><br />the urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being-symbolized by the camion suddenly emerges at the carrefour.<br /><br />so, les valseuses is much better a name than going places. to dance a valse you need to be elegant, but going places you don't.
