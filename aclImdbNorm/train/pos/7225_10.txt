after all these years, of peter o'tool's brilliant, costly giving of his soul, film after film, at last, hollywood tosses him an oscar recently.<br /><br />country dance showed up one night late, and of course, blew me out of my complainant niche in my alleged "life". how does he do it?<br /><br />york again also is brilliant in this kind of play. both psychological battleships loaded for bear....<br /><br />bravo to author, director, cast, and camera crew. no wonder the nazi's lost to these irish, scot, english blends....brutal honesty hurts...back in the 70's, when i personally believed "honesty" was pure and absolutely vital to trust. i have modified my edgy extremes, and will settle for more human, warm flaws within myself and others.<br /><br />forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear, and allows us to fix our own bull headed egos and erotic mistakes....
