it appears even the director doesn't like this film,but for me i think he's being a bit harsh on himself.<br /><br />sure it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots,and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout.<br /><br />it's shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well.<br /><br />if you like horror films shot in england, give it a go.<br /><br />i have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film 'the devil's chair' which looks quite amazing.<br /><br />there aren't enough english horror films for me, so any that come along deserve our attention, and this one isn't as bad as you may think
