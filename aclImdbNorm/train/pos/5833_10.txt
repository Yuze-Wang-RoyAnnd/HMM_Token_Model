i can't believe people are looking for a plot in this film. this is laural and hardy. lighten up already. these two were a riot. their comic genius is as funny today as it was 70 years ago. not a filthy word out of either mouth and they were able to keep audiences in stitches. their comedy wasn't sophisticated by any stretch. if a whoopee cushion can't make you grin, there's no reason to watch any of the stuff these guys did. it was a simpler time, and people laughed at stuff that was funny without a plot. i guess it takes a simple mind to enjoy this stuff, so i qualify. two man comedy teams don't compute, we're just too sophisticated... aren't we fortunate?
