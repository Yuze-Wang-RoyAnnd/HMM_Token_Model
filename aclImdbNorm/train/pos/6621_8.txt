i just came back from a pre-release viewing of this excellent sci-fi film noire. it's style is definitively unique and very well made. it is filmed with actual actors, but transformed into a black and white comic-strip style you have never seen before. it goes one step further than sin city, and it does it well. it's a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures. the story and mood remind of blade runner, and if you liked that one you will surely like this one, too. the storyline is intelligent, never boring and has some nice little twists. this film is a must-see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely don't like sci-fi or b&w.
