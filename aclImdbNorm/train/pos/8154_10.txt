okay, my title is kinda lame, and almost sells this flick short. i remember watching siskel & ebert in '94 talking about this movie, and then playing a clip or two. not being a rap-conscious guy (although i could identify snoop dogg, vanilla ice, and mc hammer music), i wasn't much interested when they started talking about the film. but then, s&e showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name (using some "shady" logic and a bunch of "made up" facts), and then another scene where the band, and their rival band, both visit a school to promote getting involved (and, of course, nwh comes up with some "info" about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee). so i filed it away that i should see this movie.<br /><br />a couple of years later, this thing shows up on hbo and i recorded it, only to laugh my butt off for hours. yes, it has a "spinal tap" kind of rhythm to it...even the documentarist takes essentially the same "tone" in setting up the clips, and the band follows a similar path (what i now call the "behind the music" phenomenon - smalltime band has good chemistry, gets famous, too much money too fast, squabbling, drugs, some type of death, band breaks up, then reconciles, finishing with a hope for more albums in the future, and fade to black). the one thing that is true is that in spinal tap, you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past. but tap drags at some points, and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes. oh, this is his rant about the backstage food, this is spot where he wants the amp to go to "eleven", this is the spot where the guy makes the pint-sized stonehenge, etc...<br /><br />contrasting to foabh, which seems to have more "unexpected" humor. you can see some of it coming, but there isn't a big setup for every joke. sometimes, the jokes just kinda flow. cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked. also, the direct references to vanilla ice, hammer, and a bunch of other caricature-type rappers really worked well. this strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs, and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes. and the songs. is "my peanuts" better than "big bottom" (from spinal tap)? i don't know - but they're both damn funny. tone def's awful video during his "awakening" phase is so bizarre, yet so funny.<br /><br />i could go on awhile, but save your time and don't waste it on cb4. i watched the first half hour, and got bored. you don't get bored on foabh. there are slightly less funny moments, but you can never tell when something good is about to happen. perhaps my favorite scene is when ice cold and tastey taste (name ripoffs if i've ever heard any) discover they've been sharing the same girl....at one point, you've got those two pointing guns at each other, and the next thing you know, the manager, the photographer, the girl, and i think even tone def are in the room pointing guns at each other, switching targets back and forth. and, of course, someone does get shot.<br /><br />i did find it odd that nwh's managers suffered similar fates to spinal tap's drummers (although none spontaneously combusted, i don't think). there were enough similarities that i cannot ignore the likelihood that cundieff saw "spinal tap" prior to writing this film, although this is clearly much more the spinal tap of hip-hop. while some similarities exist, the humor is different, and the movie seems more like a real documentary (maybe because we don't recognize a single actor in this thing, even the guy who played "lamar" from "revenge of the nerds"). all in all, this movie has, in my opinion, "street cred". kinda like nwh.
