writer/director john hughes covered all bases (as usual) with this bitter-sweet "sunday afternoon" family movie. "curly sue" is a sweet, precocious orphan, cared for from infancy by "bill". the pair live off their wits as they travel the great us of a. fate matches them with a "very pretty" yuppie lawyer, and the rest is predictable.<br /><br />kids will love this film, as they can relate to the heroine, played by 9 year old alisan poter (who went on to be the "you go girl!" of pepsi commercials). the character is supposed to be about 6 or 7, as she is urged to think about going to school. some of her vocabulary suggests that she is every day of 9 or older.<br /><br />similar to "home alone", there is plenty of slap-stick and little fists punching big fat chins. again, this is "formula" film making, aimed at a young audience. entertaining and heartwarming. don't look for any surprises, but be prepared to shed a tear or two.
