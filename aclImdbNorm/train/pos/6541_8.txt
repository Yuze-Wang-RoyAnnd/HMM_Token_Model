as a grownup in my mid-40s, i am not even close to any of "nancy drew"'s key demographics, but i was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon; so, i could tell, were the pair of sixtyish silver-haired ladies down the row from me. the older man who left the theater just ahead of me specifically praised the film to the 20-ish female usher (who said she'd seen the film the previous evening and quite liked it).<br /><br />more to the point, however: in the row just ahead of me, there were nine -- count them, nine -- ten-year-old girls lined up next to each other, passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the previews.<br /><br />once the film began, they promptly settled down to watch....<br /><br />....and didn't so much as peep till the closing credits began to roll.<br /><br />this is not a perfect film; it doesn't quite pay off its high school subplots, it's not quite confident enough of its own tone, and its thugs are just a hair too far over toward critically inept at times. but the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot hangs together fairly well, and it treads deftly between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization. last but not least, emma roberts carries the movie with startling grace -- josh flitter's superb timing notwithstanding, this is roberts' movie, and she pulls it off beautifully. her nancy drew is very much the direct ancestor of kristen bell's veronica mars, and the film is also a lineal descendant of jodie foster's early and underrated "candleshoe".<br /><br />in today's marketplace, it's a rarity: a family movie that respects its viewers' intelligence. as such, it won't be to everyone's taste -- but for what it is, it is the best movie of its kind in decades.
