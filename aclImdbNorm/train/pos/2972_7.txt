i must admit i am a big fan of south park and was expecting basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be! i think this is what happens when you mix david zucker, matt stone, and trey parker together. this movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously. the slap stick style humor mixed with stone and parker just works flawlessly. the kind of humor present in basketball was not popular upon the time of it's release and had it come out today it would be a hit. don't bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come. recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.
