i have to admit right off the top, i'm not a big fan of "family" films these days. most of them, imho, are sentimental crap. but this one, like toy story, the previous film from pixar, is a lot of fun. the two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland(especially compared to the two leads in antz, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film more than made up for it. the animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently good(i especially liked hopper's line "if i hadn't promised mother on her deathbed that i wouldn't kill you, i would kill you!"), and the actors doing the voices, except the two leads, were all terrific(denis leary doing an animated movie; what a concept). and like everyone else, i loved the outtakes! i hope the video has the new ones.
