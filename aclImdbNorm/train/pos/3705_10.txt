i don't understand the low 5.7 rating on this film. it's a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics. the tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil, down to the locale (savannah). the acting is strong, and i was amazed at the verisimilitude of kenneth branagh's southern accent. famke jansen is great, robert duval is effective in a small part, and embeth davitz is the bomb. great full nude scene of her,too.<br /><br />the plot is fairly standard but effectively executed.
