(contains slight spoilers)<br /><br />it's interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here. stewart is, of course, remembered by many as george bailey from frank capra's "it's a wonderful life", so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. in "it's a wonderful life", bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born. in "the far country", stewart's jeff webster, by not getting involved to help anyone else (except himself), gets to see essentially the same thing: a world in which he (for all practical matters) doesn't exist.<br /><br />by not getting involved (and by attempting not to care about anyone), webster is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt, pushed around, and even killed while he stands by and does nothing. this reminds the viewer of george bailey watching a world that has turned upside-down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born. <br /><br />both movies end with the same image - a close-up of a ringing bell. stewart, by turning around his philosophy of non-involvement, has, it would seem, earned his "wings".
