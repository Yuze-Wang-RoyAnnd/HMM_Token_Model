simply one of the best ever! richard brooks' adaptation of truman capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. stunning black and white cinematography (that should have won an oscar), a haunting quincy jones score and tremendous performances by robert blake and scott wilson as the oddly-matched killers. this film was 0 for 4 at the academy awards and wasn't even nominated for best picture while dr. doolittle was. go figure! <br /><br />although you don't get to know the clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on perry and dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down. john forsythe is also impressive as alvin dewey. there are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10. best performance = scott wilson with r. blake a close second. highly recommended!
