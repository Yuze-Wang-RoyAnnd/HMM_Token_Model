this is another great movie i had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to rick baker et al). back in the late 80's i was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new about the big three jc, sh & yb. i wasn't sure what to expect when i payed my hard earned money to see this in a "triple bill of classics" at the old scala. i need not have worried, i was left breathless by this movie. if you're a fan of hong kong action / kung fu movies and haven't seen this movie, do so now!
