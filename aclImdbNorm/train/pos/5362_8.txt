the running man, along with total recall, is my favorite schwarzenegger movie. no, this isn't 2001, but it's not meant to be. and the acting and script here isn't even up to par with other arnie movies like predator or the terminator. but i submit that the idea behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. a state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (the runners are equipped with none) in order to satisfy the public's lust for sport and blood. the ultimate prize for a winning runner: freedom. or so the rules claim.<br /><br />for a movie with such over-the-top gory death scenes and cheesy one-liners, it really does have a lot to say. someone else has pointed out all the commentary on culture/government presented in this movie, so i won't go into it here. suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie, you will enjoy it very much (especially if you're a big sf fan with a lot of imagination). like i said, it's not trying to be a serious art film, but it is surprisingly layered for a 80s shoot-em-up flick. the premise is borrowed from a richard bachman (aka stephen king) short novel, but diverges fairly strongly from its source material, especially towards the end. (the book ends rather nihilistically; needless to say this movie doesn't.) i enjoyed both, but i like the movie better.<br /><br />my favorite line: "guess it's caused from steroids."
