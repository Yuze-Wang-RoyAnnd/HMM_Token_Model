i find this movie very enjoyable. the plot is simple and easily digestible, the humour is light and clean, and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common, i find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out. turns out to be very nice. the performance of the female lead is admirable; her portrayal of an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to david's sophisticated role was very charming. i also find vera's dancing very, very well done. i find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly.<br /><br />for those who have had enough of profanity-filled movies of today, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly.
