a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only, the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids. as a matter of fact, with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces, at least for continuity's sake.<br /><br />speaking of ann sheridan, she is the one true shining light of this movie. to paraphrase a clich'e, ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvd!<br /><br />another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan. unfortunately , this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background. for a better example of the sheridan-reagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row.
