this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action. what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated. it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around, her movements were done so well. why don't they use this rotoscopic technique more these days? it's quite effective.<br /><br />fire and ice, in it's prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women, was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy. some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy, others (including plenty of women) will adore it's esthetic quality. i for sure did not mind! bakshi just loves animating lushious, voluptuous babes, as can also be seen in cool world, and i don't think he has to apoligize since it's pretty much animation for adults. but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot it.<br /><br />this one was just special, so different from the standard disney or anime fare, and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it's possibly bakshi's finest. for those who like animations with lushious women: try space adventure cobra as well.<br /><br />i give fire and ice 8 out of 10.
