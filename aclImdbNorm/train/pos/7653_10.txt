shot in the heart is wonderful. it brilliantly illustrates the plight of gary gimore, a convicted murder who requested death. shot in the heart shows the ordeal that gilmore's family, torn up by hatred, went through. this movie is an incredible psychological study, and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting. 10/10
