this movie was featured on a very early episode of mystery science theater 3000, but when i see this film, i don't think about that wonderful tv series. i believe this was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick, with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie. i actually enjoyed watching bela lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides, an old hag, and her two bizarre sons, one a giant idiot, the other a comical dwarf(angelo rossitto from 1932's freaks). i also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter, who is kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch. my only problem with this otherwise decent film is it's plot, even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. i don't want to spoil any of this film, so go out and rent it, or, better yet, buy it for a couple of bucks.
