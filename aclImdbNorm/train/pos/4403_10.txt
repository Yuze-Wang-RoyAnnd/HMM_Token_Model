ride with the devil, like ang lee's later brokeback mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. film lovers ought to see it at minimum twice as its artistic nuance is worthy to be over comprehended. <br /><br />a perfect piece of art, surprising depth of humanity. i really don't recall another war film, will so capture you, will change your existing conception of history and politics, will restore your belief in humanity. after seeing so many killings, so many sufferings , you don't feel yourself numb, instead you treasure the bond between human beings more. the actors' performances haunt your heart, the music drives your mind. some shoots, are not just some pictures, they transcend themselves, becoming the seeing of soul. such is the true sense of film being a genre of art.<br /><br />a film like this doesn't need long comments or reviews, everything it says by itself. ovation to the cast which includes tobey maguire, jeffrey wright and jewel kilcher, the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!
