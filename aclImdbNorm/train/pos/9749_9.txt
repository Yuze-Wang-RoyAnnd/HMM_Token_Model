i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago. i definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time, but he changed my views. i enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since. i even bought several of his cd's. who cares what his acting abilities were, he basically just played himself, which was adorable. he was so charming, so charismatic; i honestly just wanted to hug him. i feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly. it was so straight, did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions. he deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. he will definitely be missed!!!
