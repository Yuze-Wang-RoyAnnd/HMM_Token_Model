forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder . as soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure . we meet the unforgetable robbie , the mysterious dr morbuis , his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - the krell who died out overnight . or did they ? <br /><br />you can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis barron`s electronic music adds even more atmosphere <br /><br />i`m shocked this film isn`t in the top 250 imdb films .
