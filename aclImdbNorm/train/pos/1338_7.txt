the year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors. other than mohabbatein and kaho naa pyaar hai nothing stood out. cccc had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around india and abroad. the only information given was that it was a suspense thriller. the film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good. the main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled. salman and preiti give a good performance where salman doesn't actually take is shirt off at all..must be special effects!! rani plays salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with preiti who plays prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. the three main leads confirm, after har di jo pyar karega, they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry(apparently). salman khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses. rani's character does not know preiti is a prostitute until the end...this kept from her and the rest of the family...the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you. the songs are all picturised well especially dekhne walon and the main title song. the other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as salmans loving family. abbas mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully..i say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer!
