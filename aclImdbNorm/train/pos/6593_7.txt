i have watched this film twice now and think its quite good for the limited equipment used to create this film. (filmed in 1947) dr. heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of south american pre-colubian indians to the polynesia's islands by way raft fell of large balsa trees. this documentary follows dr. heyerdahl and crew as they select balsa trees in equidor and float with them down river to the pacific for assembly in peru. they launch off on a 101 day sea adventure testing the strength of their primitive raft surviving only by means available to natives of that era. see for yourself, a real adventure!
