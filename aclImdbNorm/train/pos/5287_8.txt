this is one of quite a few cartoons with bugs bunny and marvin the martian - and a space dog called k-9 is included as well. this looney tunes episode is very funny, has reasonably good cartoon animation (marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. the end is rather weird, so be prepared for it, it is slightly boring. <br /><br />in this episode, marvin the martian has been sent to earth to capture an earth creature and bring it back to mars. with his trusty dog k-9, marvin sets out and soon finds the tracks of no other rabbit but bugs bunny! he greets them with treats, thinking they are trick or treaters in their costumes. little does he realise they are preparing themselves to take this rabbit to mars...<br /><br />i recommend this episode to anyone who likes bugs bunny, marvin the martian and looney tunes in general. as far as the beginning and the middle of the episode are concerned, you are likely to like this. enjoy "hasty hare"! :-)
