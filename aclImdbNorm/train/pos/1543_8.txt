i remember seeing this film years ago on, i think, bbc2. i would very much like to view it again - does anyone know how i can obtain a copy? as i remember, it was an especially powerful movie, in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks. apart from that i really can't recall too much about the story - which is why i want to view it again! i have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - perhaps there is no dvd or vhs of this film on the market. would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this. thanks very much in advance for your assistance. best regards, albany234@googlemail.com
