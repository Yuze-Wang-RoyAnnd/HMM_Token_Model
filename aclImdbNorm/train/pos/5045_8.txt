the film is very complete in what it is, keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder, one simply cannot go wrong. the very plot in itself, the very story and essence of the film, is entertaining. it is the sort of story that the director (bill paxton) could do so much with, and in this case, he really did do a lot with it.<br /><br />from beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going, and the creativity that is behind this story is first class. i felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls -- the action flowing neatly, quickly, and tightly from one scene to the next. <br /><br />it demonstrates just how far people can go: so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones, and to do such acts of evil, in the name of 'god' when they are disillusioned as in this case. it also is sometimes interesting in its' twists & takes on the concept of morality as a whole.<br /><br />overall, this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks, but i would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out -- it is very much so worth your time.
