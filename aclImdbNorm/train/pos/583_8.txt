in a little town in montana two brothers grow up. one of them is norman (craig sheffer), the other is paul (brad pitt). their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion, and the lessons of fly-fishing. in this movie fly-fishing represents life, a little.<br /><br />the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action. probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen, but about the message. some things do happen though. norman goes to dartmouth to study. after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie (emily lloyd) and he is invited to teach in chicago. paul has become a reporter and is known as the "fishing reporter". he is famous and it seems he has a nice life, but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much.<br /><br />the movie is very well directed, it has a nice score and all of the actors are good. the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography. the mountains, the woods and the river all look very beautiful. if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch. fortunately there is more.
