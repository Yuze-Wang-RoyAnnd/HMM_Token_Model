two years later... bill (alex winter) and ted (keanu reeves) are becoming near rock stars in the present future but still needing more work in their instruments. in the future, bill & ted are in the public popular history but then a evil man (joss ackland) is set to kill bill & ted by sending cyborg look-likes to destroy them. cyborgs are sent to the past present and they actually murder the real bill & ted. now, both guys are spirits and they have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future.<br /><br />directed by peter hewitt (tom and huck, the borrowers) made a clever sequel with terrific visual effects. much more funny and entertaining than the original. william sadler (the shawshank redemption) steals the show as the grim reaper.<br /><br />dvd has an good anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd has the theatrical trailer and an amusing behind the scenes featurette. this sequel was a box office hit like the original but it is also (believe it or not), one of the best sequels ever made (depending on your point of view). george carlin reprises his role from the original briefly. pam grier also appears in a bit role. it's a enjoyable fantasy comedy.
