i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible. i am attempting to watch all things star trek. this is month 3 and i am now on season 3 of tng and i have already gone thru ds9 in its entirety. star trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved.<br /><br />"shades of grey" is the first recap episode in the tng series. having just watched the shows, these clips were fresh in my mind, but i noticed how a couple of them were re-shot because the film looked better. season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me - and the actors looked silly, like they didn't fit in their own skins.<br /><br />the show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in riker's life on the enterprise up until this point. the data and riker scene in the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship. my other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the klingon ship challenges riker's authority as first officer and riker beat the living crap out of that klingon. then the admiral kicks his a$$ but good. this entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy, great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies! at this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie riker to deanna troi as imzadi. up until this point they have mentioned the fact, but they have yet to exploit it. let the record show that the st wiki - memory alpha claims that imzadi means "first" and denotes that she has had intimate relations with riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one. this episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come.<br /><br />here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/imzadi by this point in the series, production value is up to speed and star trek tng is settling into the sci-fi behemoth it was destined to become. watching this again as an adult i see now what great actors the star trek universe provides. they really need to make a new st show set after all the current shows. a ds9 movie would have been nice too.
