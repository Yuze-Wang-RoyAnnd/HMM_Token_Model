greetings from this portuguese guy :)<br /><br />i believe the sopranos are one of the best production ever, it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way, that it's hard to see the difference. it has the same quality as godfather! james gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove! i would love the sopranos would never finish at all. it's perfect! it should be a subject in school :) i saw sopranos when i was a kid, but i was too young to stay waked until the episode ends, so now i bought the all episodes in dvd format and i am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and i am getting addicted, like i did with prison break. in my opinion prison break and the sopranos are the best-ever series made for television. the argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect. congratulations for such a work.<br /><br />sorry about my english. thanks for reading.
