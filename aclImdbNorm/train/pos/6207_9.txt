i just saw this film @ tiff (toronto international film festival). fans of hal hartley will not be disappointed!! and if you are not familiar with this director's oeuvre ... doesn't matter. this film can definitely stand all on its own. i have to go the second screening ... it was amazing i need to see it again -- and fast!! <br /><br />this film is very funny. it's dialogue is very smart, and the performance of parker posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of fay grim. fay grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film henry fool (2000). visually, the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted (or dutch) angle, which can be often seen in past hartley works appearing in various shorts, available in the possible films: short works by hal hartley 1994-2004 collection, and in the girl from monday (2005).<br /><br />i viewed this film most aptly on sept 11th. textually, fay grim's adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after september 11, 2001. without going into major spoilers, i view this work, and story-world as a bravely political and original portrait of geo-politics that is rarely, if ever, foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post-911 heretofore (cf. syrianna: of side note - mark cuban exec. prod in both these films ... most interesting, to say the least). <br /><br />lastly, for those closely attached to the characters of henry fool, simone, fay and henry this film is hilariously self-conscious and self-referential. that being said, the character of fay grimm starts off in the film, exactly where she was when henry fool ended, but by the end of the film ... fay's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative. what can be in store for the future of fay and the fool family ... ?? i can't wait for the third part in this story!
