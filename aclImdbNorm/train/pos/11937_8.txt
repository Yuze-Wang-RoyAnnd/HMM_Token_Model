that was definitely the case with angels in the outfield. it was on tv last night and i believe i hadn't seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and i'm now in my 4th year of college. although the film has many flaws, it is just so touching that you can't help but sit down, watch it, and enjoy yourself. it is also hilarious. danny glover's ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time. it adds to the film and i'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted. you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best. a must see. i highly recommend.<br /><br />8/10
