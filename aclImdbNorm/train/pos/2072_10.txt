i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television. it is far superior in action than most movies since. martin sheen is excellent, and though nick nolte has a small part, he too provides excellent support. vic morrow as the villain is superb.<br /><br />when sheen "tests the water" in his '34 ford (cool) along the mountainous highway it is spectacular!<br /><br />the ending is grand.<br /><br />i'm disappointed in the low vote this received. i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days.<br /><br />good taste eludes the masses!
