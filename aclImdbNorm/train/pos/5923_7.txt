a woman who hates cats (alice krige) and her son (brian krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean teacher (glenn shadix), their incestuous relationship, a lovely girl (m"adchen amick) and one hell of a big secret.<br /><br />okay, so technically, this is a "bad film". but, who cares? it's so very fun! <br /><br />impossible things (involving corn) happen, people freak out about kitty cats, there's bad one-liners, there's too much cheese to handle!<br /><br />so, yes. you will enjoy this. a lot. it won't move you, touch you, scare you, or thrill you in any way, but it will keep you entertained and laughing!
