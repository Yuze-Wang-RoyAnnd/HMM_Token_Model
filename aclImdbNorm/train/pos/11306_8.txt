a deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe: an impoverished giovanna has ended up in the gutter, but still has an ace up her sleeve: beauty and youth. bragana, a fat-bellied gas station tenant, who has been getting on in years, picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection. but the physical contact that giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust, and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of.<br /><br />the arrival of gino, a young migrant worker, finally provides her the longed-for opportunity. and you don't have to ask her twice: at the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired, and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance.<br /><br />the developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by giovanna though. gino's yearning for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave the place with giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside. giovanna aims at another goal: to get bragana killed, to inherit and, in addition to that, to collect the insurance premium. in her hands gino degenerates into a self-sacrificing tool. being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold-blooded killer.<br /><br />but in contrast to giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level. the very taking over of bragana's place, which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man, causes a deep loathing of himself. and later, after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through giovanna's cunningly devised plan, he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute.<br /><br />if visconti's film ended at this point, it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool, calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism. but then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse. at last giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done, and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew gino's love. her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate. it also affects us, while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster. the culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start.<br /><br />
