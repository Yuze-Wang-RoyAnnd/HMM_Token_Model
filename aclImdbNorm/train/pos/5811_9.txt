only a 9/10 from me, a perfect ten would have been if there was more of a plot to the movie, but nevertheless moonwalker to this day remains a fun fest of music, dance and entertainment. beginning with the montage of video clips from jackson's long career, it reminds the viewer of just why he is often regarded as 'the king of pop'. from his hit 'i want you back' to 'we are the world' the multi-award winning charity record for the benefit of africa. following this a short movie of sorts, although lacklustre in an oscar winning script, nonetheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. ending with a perfect (sexy!) rendition of 'come together'. something the whole family can watch and enjoy.
