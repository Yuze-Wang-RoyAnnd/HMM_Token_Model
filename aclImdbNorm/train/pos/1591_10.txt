my mom and i have just recently become addicted to this show, laughing our butts off! i've only seen about 10 episodes, and i am disappointed that i didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled! the story line is very funny, the characters really have great personalities (or, not so great, but they're still funny!). i tivo every episode of what i like about you. amanda bynes and jennie garth, as well as all of the cast, never leave me bored while watching! there is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content, but with a parental guide near, you shouldn't have too much problems. there is some sort of 'friends' type of relationship that attracts me to this show. i really enjoy it.
