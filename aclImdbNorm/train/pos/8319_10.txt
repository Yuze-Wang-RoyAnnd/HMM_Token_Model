i was 5 years old when i saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in st. thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later, it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that i have set to accomplish since that time!<br /><br />this tragic story of a hard-core "behind the scenes" of the entertainment industry during the late 50's, "sparkle" successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. this story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand.<br /><br />the phenomenal music written and composed by aretha franklin and curtis mayfield, the soundtrack carries the plot with every song. from being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long-term decision-making, to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead, all three young girls, sparkle, sister, and delores, represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society.<br /><br />this movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating "dreamgirls" on broadway, and mariah carey's "glitter," 25 years later. as an original audience member of both productions, i have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to "sparkle," as well as in "saturday night fever," "fame," "flashdance," and the off-broadway smash hit "mama, i want to sing."
