this is probably the best television show i've ever seen. i first saw it on comedy central several years ago. at the time i was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order, and having just watched all three series in order and unedited (thank you internet and your wondrous "series of tubes") i am so glad i rediscovered it! i think comedy central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a "season"......and i tried to get friends and family to watch it, but nobody really seemed to like it (i need new friends). so, on my own, i made the best out of it that i could. even when i felt like it was waning a bit, i still felt compelled to continue watching. years after when i discovered little britain, i immediately recognized pauline from log as having influenced marjorie in fat fighters. also, i love the idea of writers who act the entire show....(not new, but done impeccably here). lb has nothing on log! (no offense, matt & david....love you)! this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius. serial murder, implied cannibalism.....you name it and it's probably found in this wonderful, unique piece of tv art. the location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of royston vasey.....you'll never leave! i think my favorite character would have to be tubbs, but each character as portrayed has it's own "charm". my least favorite was papa lazarous, that was until he re-surfaced in series three (clever and wholly unexpected)! it's best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as i said before, becomes so compelling (while repulsing) that you really can't stop watching. this is not for those with weak stomachs, kids, conservatives or grandma (unless you've got one saucy granny)! i have always loved british tv, particularly comedies, from monty python to benny hill, red dwarf to keeping up appearances, absolutely fabulous and the british originals coupling and the office (but not their us counterparts....sorry). this is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between what's funny and what's just sick and twisted. nothing, nothing on us tv has ever come close to this level of entertainment. us broadcast tv is so sad and lame, i can barely stand to watch any of it. it's kind of sad that even our cable channels don't have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem (your loss, comedy central). thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the "across the pond" that redeem the entire medium every decade or so. basic cable here in the us has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently "crossing lines" with more graphic sexual content, drug use and adult language, but they are still years away from just deciding to be adults about showing real life, adult behavior (instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up, sheesh, it's like the same basic show format for the past 35 years)! don't even get me started on us sitcoms! waste of time and lots of wasted money......did you know that "according to jim" has been on the air for 10 years??? 10 years?? anyway... watch this show, get it on dvd, do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well! you've never seen anything like it. there are three specials that i have not watched yet....i'm saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits. he'll watch them, even if i have to chain him up and paint him with excrement! lines and lines and lines and lines! note that series three departs from one and two....the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters, the laugh track is gone (thank bloody hell), the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of royston vasey. don't be thrown by any of that as by the end, the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two. i think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable. brilliant, confident and absolutely demented. you will want to re-watch it again and again. it's amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight-gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close-up facial expression. if ever i were to meet any of the writer/performers, i'd implore them not to recreate it or try to top it.....i'd just say "can i help you at all?" (then they'd probably slap me, so i'd ask them to sign the slap-mark)! 10 out of 10
