like "my sassy girl", this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet, but that's where the similarities end. the story is generally about this rebellious guy named ji-hoon (kwon sang woo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a tutor named su-wan (kim ha neul), a woman who comes from a poor background, but happens to be the same age as him. add to that some obstacles, martial arts (thugs are always after ji-hoon for revenge), a scorned, thuggish love-sick girl who is after him, his proclivity for ditching the lessons, and you generally can guess the whole story. did i mention it's a romantic comedy? this movie has some good fight scenes, great visual humor and a lot of spunk, thanks to the good chemistry between kim ha nuel and kwon sang woo, that bring a lot of energy to the story. the romantic elements also work because of that reason. and, i must say, i'd want a girlfriend more like kim ha nuel than that girl from "my sassy girl" (personality-wise, at least). she has some spunk, but it's more on the cute, sweet, good-hearted way. characters are already mostly likable (so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than "my sassy girl"--an obstacle that worked for that movie to its credit), and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way. the story kind of sags, though, about 2/3 of the way (where it sort of treads on familiar, standard fare, where nothing really interesting happens), but near the end, it picks up a bit again. overall, a fun, cute movie. 8/10
