this short film trailer is basically about superman and batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance.obviously,the two characters have vastly differing views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment.it's a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along.i won't go int to the storyline here.but i will get into the acting,which is terrific.everyone is well cast.the two actors playing superman and batman are well suited to their characters.the same filmmakers that made batman: dead end and grayson also made this short film.of the three,i probably liked this one the least,but i still thought it was well done.for me,world's finest is a 7/10
