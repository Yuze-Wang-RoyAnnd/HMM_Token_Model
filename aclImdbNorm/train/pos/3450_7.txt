having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit sceptical, there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that can't do anything film a bad script, and in some cases don't seem to care.<br /><br />well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release, it is good. the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry. i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role, ok he's not oscar material yet, but he'll learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here. dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie.<br /><br />ultimately, just give it a go. you won't be disappointed, you won't be bored, in fact, i think you'll be more than happy with the end result.
