okay, truthfully, i saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself, what are the producers thinking? hutton, jolie, and duchovny? how could the monotoned actor possibly compete with jolie's natural power on the screen? but surprisingly, the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss. even david's humor matched up to jolie's spark and fire. as for hutton, he played the psycho very well, contrasting with david's calm delivery of life threatening situations. overall, i was very impressed with the writing and character development. i gave it 8 stars.
