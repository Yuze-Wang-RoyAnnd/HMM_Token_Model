so much has been written about the film's plot, the wonderful acting performance, the script, the melancholy, bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction - what can i add? just watch for one of the most heart warming, beautifully acted, poignant scenes ever filmed. it is christmas eve and frank morgan's character (the owner of the shop - mr. matuschek)is recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt. as each of his employees leave he invites them to a christmas dinner. each and everyone of them politely turn him down. they all have plans for their own christmas eve. at this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene. frank morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears. thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene. the new employee, the errand boy, is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene. desperately mr. matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him, he will treat him to all the wonderful christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen!the chap is overwhelmed, he too is obviously as lonely as mr. matuschek and together they can have a wonderful christmas meal. every time i see this scene it moves me. if you manage to get the delightful dvd look at the great trailer with frank morgan introducing himself as mr. matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film- the talented ernst lubitsch. this film is a joy from beginning to end.
