i absolutely loved this movie! it was so good! this movie is told by the parrot, paulie's point of view. paulie is given to the little girl marie, as a present. paulie helps marie learn to talk and they become best friends. but when paulie tells marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away. that's when the adventure begins. paulie goes through so much to find his way back to marie. this movie is so sweet, funny, touching, sad, and more. when i first watched this movie, it made me cry. the birds courage and urge to go find his marie for all that time, was so touching. i must say that the ending is so sweet and sad, but you'll have to watch it to find out how it goes. at the end, the janitor tries to help him, after hearing his story. will he find his long lost marie or not? find out when you watch this sweet, heart warming movie. it'll touch your heart. rating:10
