a meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around crater lake . as the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster.<br /><br />recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like lost skeleton of cadavra and alien trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like crater lake monster available for screening. it's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal. its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it. this is a real drive-in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as star wars changed the way we look at special effects. the monster, a mix of stop motion and a life size head, is a charmingly quaint little beast. the filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem. sure its clear that its all fake, but isn't movies about suspension of disbelief? actually i think its about really cool monsters, which this has.<br /><br />i like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way. if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther. this would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films (boggy creek etc.)
