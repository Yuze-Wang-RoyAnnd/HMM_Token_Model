wonderfully put together..i wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one. it was great..the film wasn't long enough..i would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up!! this is so important to the community period..well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort...i am really tired of hearing from naive writers how aids and men go together when they don't; actually its the hetero's that we need to look into..this film didn't even bother to mention hiv or aids and i was so glad for that..i really appreciated the break downs and definitions too. thank you s much for allowing this film to exist.
