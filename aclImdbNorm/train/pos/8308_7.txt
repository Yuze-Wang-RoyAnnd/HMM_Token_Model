it is fitting on a musical sunday to get your heart a pumping, and no one can do that better than little richard. the man could sing the drawers off the ladies and defined rock and roll.<br /><br />look to leon to provide a definitive characterization, as he has done so with david ruffin in the temptations and jackie wilson in mr. rock 'n' roll: the alan freed story.<br /><br />this was a fascinating biopic as we saw little richard struggle with his father, with his church and with himself over just who he was. he won the battle and there is no one else that has his voice or his style.
