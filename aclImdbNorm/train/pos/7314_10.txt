the first time i saw this movie, i fell in love with it. the atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost. i expected a gore fest, but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack (it's actually my ringer at the moment :p). the fact that i couldn't predict when he'd kill and when he'd disappear was a major plus in my book. predictable horror movies bore me. now, i know the storyline had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion. finally, as i mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. it's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores, so i was very happy to hear that rob zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake. speaking of the remake, i read a very comprehensive article on it and, now that i know that mr. zombie reveres john carpenter, i have high hopes for his take on this classic. this movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, you name it for an all hallow's eve movie marathon. :)
