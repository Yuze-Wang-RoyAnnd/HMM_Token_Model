the title overstates the content of this movie somewhat, which might lead to some unrealized expectations. frankly speaking, there's very little "panic in the streets" to be seen here. in fact, throughout the movie very few people actually know that there's a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters. having said that, what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway (because, unlike the people "in the streets", the viewer knows what's going on) and that director elia kazan builds very deliberately. as the plague-infected killer is sought, one of the more interesting sidebars i found was the developing relationship between dr. reed (richard widmark) and police captain warren (paul douglas). at the beginning, the two really don't like each other, even though they have to work together. by the end, they've forged a real bond of respect for each other. kazan did a good job with that.<br /><br />pretty much all the performances here were excellent. widmark and douglas were great, and i was quite taken with a very early look at jack palance playing what would become his typical "heavy" role. i found very little to criticize here. perhaps barbara bel geddes came across as a little bit flat as reed's wife nancy, but her role wasn't really central to the story. all in all, an excellent piece of work. 9/10
