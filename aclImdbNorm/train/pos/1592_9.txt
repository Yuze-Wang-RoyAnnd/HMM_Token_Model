'what i like about you' is definitely a show that i couldn't wait to see each day. amanda bynes is such an excellent actress and i grew up watching her show: 'the amanda show.' she's a very funny person and seems to be down to earth. "holly" is such a like-able person and has an "out-there" personality. i enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down, so she messed herself up at times. but that's what made the show so great.<br /><br />i especially loved the show when the character 'vince' came along. nick zano is very hot and funny, as well as 'gary', wesley jonathan. the whole cast was great, each character had their own personality and charm. jennie garth, allison munn, and leslie grossman were all very interesting. i especially loved 'lauren'; she's the best! she helped make the show extra funny and you never know what she's gonna do or say next! overall the show is really nice but the reason i didn't give it a 10 was because there's no more new episodes and because the episodes could've been longer and more deep.
