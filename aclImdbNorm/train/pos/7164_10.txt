in the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area (or whatever the title for that oscar is), "holes" has credibility. i think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material. if the author can't write a screenplay to save their life, then have the author and someone fluently talented in the area of screenwriting create it. aside from that, this review is about "holes".<br /><br />the reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within. (1) louis sachar is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay. i watched the movie and then read the book and both didn't reek incoherence or stupidity. some people just have natural talents that can transcend mediums. (2) the best performance award goes to shia labeouf for his portrayal as the main character. he "dug" himself into the role. i wanted to see his character vindicated before the conclusion. (3) to ratchet up the suspense a bit, andrew davis was brought in. this is the man that made harrison ford run hard and run fast. he also can make steven seagal smash some heads. as for this film, he made shia and the rest of the boys dig some holes. in other words, he can make an "action-packed" movie and make it well even if "action" isn't the main genre isn't "action". (4) my second favorite performance goes to jon voight as mr. sir. sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer. when voight uttered the line "once upon a time...", i must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny. he is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent. (5) tim blake nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script. this is probably the second best role i have seen him in (second only to 'o brother where art thou?'). (6) i love the choice of settings for the movie. i didn't know california was that dry or that barren. i guess population and land area figures both can be misleading. (7) the overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water. one could only imagine digging a hole in that barren area for half a day. (8) the rest of the cast should deserve a box of kudos bars as well. sigourney weaver, henry winkler, khleo thomas, jake m. smith and the rest of the bill were tapped because of their talents and it gelled very well. great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble. (9) i like a movie that doesn't explain anything right away. when stanley got clocked in the head with those baseball cleats, it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key ingredient in making a good movie. (10) disney pictures (not touchstone, disney!!) needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films. it was palatable for me and i am a college student. the last mature juvenile disney film i saw was "something wicked this way comes" and "holes" possibly exceeds it (like the election in 2000, it's still to close to call). disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over milking a cash cow when they see it. ten reasons give a score of ten!<br /><br />all in all, "holes" is one of my favorite disney films and probably one of the best this year (granted this movie may not be oscar material but whoever said oscar material is the best material?). in terms of being a movie from a book i have read, this ranks behind "fight club" on my list (which is on top). for being a film i saw in 2003, this is in the top five (somewhere behind "mystic river"). compared against "harry potter", stanley yelnats easily takes a shovel to harry's head and brings the final death blow with a smelly sneaker to potter's nose. everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains. here ends my rant!
