"dressed to kill" is brian depalma's best film, an absolute thrill ride of suspense, humor and style that remains unrivaled today. depalma has a bum rap in hollywood, as most people claim that he rips off alfred hitchcock. he does not. hitchcock could only dream of what depalma shows in his thrillers.<br /><br />sadly, the original uncut version of "dressed to kill" is no longer available on video. the current copy released by goodtimes is the jack valenti approved r rated cut. but some copies of depalma's original cut still exist. it is the one distributed by warner home video, in both a green cardboard box with angie dickinson on the cover, or in a black clamshell case with the theatrical poster on silver lining. these are the ones to get, if you can find a copy. i have the green one and it is among my treasured possessions.<br /><br />anyway, back to the story. dickinson plays kate miller, a sexually frustrated wife who is being treated by dr. robert elliott ( michael caine) for her obsessive fantasies. while on a trip to the museum (a real tour-de-force for depalma in terms of camera work and suspense), <br /><br />miller is picked up by a stranger. you can pretty much guess what happens to her, since the ads and box art give away the story. but there are a few complications. a hooker (nancy allen) is the sole witness to the murder. kate miller's son peter (keith gordon) is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime. and dr. elliott's answering machine has a certain message on it...about a missing razor...<br /><br />i'm not spoiling the film at all for you since what i have described above takes place within the opening half hour and depalma's biggest surprises are reserved for the last hour. this film is explicit, however, enough for valenti (head of the mpaa) to demand cuts in the film. what surprises me is what cuts he wanted. several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two slashing scenes and some of nancy allen's dialogue (valenti wanted "cock" changed to "bulge"). this is a film that is very violent and bloody, yet the objections are to sexual content. i'd love to hear valenti's explaination at how seeing two women in a tender love scene in "lost and delirious" is somehow more damaging to a young mind than arnold schwarzenegger blowing away people with a chain gun. it just isn't fair.<br /><br />what makes "dressed to kill" so good is that not only are the technical credits first rate, but the performances are very good as well. michael caine, who was in a lot of crap in this time period, gives one of his best performances as the doctor. angie dickinson is better than usual, possibly because she actually has a strong role here. nancy allen adds this to her range of performances that has her pegged as one of the most underrated and overlooked actresses in the world. keith gordon is wonderful as the genius and i loved all those inventions of his.<br /><br />depalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved. the recent joke of the afi 100 best thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what a thriller is. if they were to actually open their eyes for once, they would see that depalma has staked his career in thrillers and is actually the best craftsman. this is even better than "psycho". it's a shame that very few actually know that.<br /><br />**** out of 4 stars
