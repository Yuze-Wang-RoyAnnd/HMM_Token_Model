this isn't the best bigfoot ever made, but by the recent standards of nature gone awry movies, mostly showing on the sci-fi channel, this is quality stuff. it has some action, some humor, decent f/x and bigfoot. cg is used, but so are some practical f/x, which i like.<br /><br />overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of b horror/sci-fi and need a fix. it's better than the movie sasquatch and not a sequel to it, so don't be fooled.<br /><br />the acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate. expect a bit of a lul as the characters are "developed", but know that things will pick up. if you are watching a dvd you may want to skip a chapter or two.
