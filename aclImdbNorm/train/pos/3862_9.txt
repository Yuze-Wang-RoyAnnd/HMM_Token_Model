as i am always looking for something new and unique, i watched this film online. i thought that it would be just another "b" rate movie but i was amazed at the acting by the two main characters. all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed. the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story.<br /><br />this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp, "dumb and dumber" or blood and guts. this is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting.<br /><br />i would prefer this movie to many "a" rate movies i have seen even a great number with high box office earnings.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie.
