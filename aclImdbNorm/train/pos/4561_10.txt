i have seen this film three times now, and each time i see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch.<br /><br />the acting is amazing, which is not hard to believe since it is daniel day lewis, who is an amazing actor. brenda fricker is the surprise wonder in it, though. she captures your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy, who is not able to walk, or speak until he is in his late teens.<br /><br />i can't say enough good things about the movie, but i will stop here. i recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are based on actual events, or just enjoy good dramas in general.
