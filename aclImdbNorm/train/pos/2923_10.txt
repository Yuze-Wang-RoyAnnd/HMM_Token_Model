eddie murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this hbo stand up comedy show.i love his impressions of mr. t,ed norton and ralph cramden of "the honeymooners",elvis presley,and michael jackson too.the ice cream man,goony goo goo,is also funny.i saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984.i laughed so hard,i almost fell off my chair.i still think this is very funny.<br /><br />eddie murphy,when he was on "saturday night live",made me laugh so hard,he is one of the best people to come out of"saturday night live"."eddie murphy delirious"is his best stand up performance next to "eddie murphy raw".<br /><br />i give "eddie murphy delirious" 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars.
