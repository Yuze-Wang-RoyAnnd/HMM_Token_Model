there have been many film and tv productions of jane eyre each with aspects to recommend them, but i suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now. it's just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others do). timothy dalton is utterly in his element as rochester, rarely missing the mark; his performance is astonishingly nimble and many-colored, while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character. zelah clarke's jane is more cerebral than otherworldly, but she makes a perfect foil for dalton (who, appropriately, towers over her!) the nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing (once you've absorbed the shock of dalton's charisma). there are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better; though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the bbc's standards of that time. but, it's the performances that are the real pleasure. don't miss this one!
