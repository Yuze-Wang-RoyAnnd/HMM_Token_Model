high school friends andre kriegman and cal gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying assault on their high school. as they begin the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge, the two start a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission.<br /><br />there is another similar movie like this, called "elephant." why do i bring this up? to compare the two films, of course. i have to say, even though i liked "elephant," this is a much better film. what's the difference, you ask? well, for starters, this is shot differently, much along the lines of "cloverfield," "blair witch project," and "diary of the dead." this makes the movie all the better because it's much more painfully realistic.<br /><br />but what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the "other side of the story." you get to know these two shooters, unlike "elephant." i actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did. this movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white.<br /><br />to be honest, this is why i almost cried in this movie. the characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions. you get to understand them. it's not like they want to kill people for attention. overall, this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than "elephant."
