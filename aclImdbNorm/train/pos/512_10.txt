"stairway to heaven" is a outstanding invention of movie making, probably never duplicated. i rank it with "the wizard of oz" and "african queen," although it is a totally different type of movie than "african queen." "stairway to heaven" is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are totally unique. <br /><br />for example, there is the combination of b&w and color footage - as in "oz," but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in "oz." in "stairway" the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful.<br /><br />another brilliant aspect of "stairway" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still
