after reading several comments, i felt i had to add in my two cents as well. "sorrow lost" is one of the most memorable shorts i think i have ever seen. i had gotten the chance to see this at the new york independent film festival. i felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. the story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short amount of time. the story is focused on a young girl who is victimized by her abusive father. she is soon given the choice to "stop" him by a demon played by "witchblade's eric etebari." having watched the show, i was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character. i never knew he could act so well! his character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. the acting was absolutely superb by him. the girl's was okay and the father's was decent. there is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future. the effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing. i wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. it is rare you get to see such a high quality short. the opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film. this isn't to say that it's not without its flaws - i thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long. but this stuck in my head days after watching it. there are very few shorts with this level of quality.
