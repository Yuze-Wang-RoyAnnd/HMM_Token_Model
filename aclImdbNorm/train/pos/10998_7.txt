it's actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond, as i'm sure he wouldn't be able to keep up in the nowadays spying-business, where fast cars have been replaced with hi-tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment. "cypher" is a pretty inventive sci-fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright & claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible. you know the trend in these types of movies: nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot, the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again. the events in "cypher" supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world, where the major companies don't really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other's thunder. company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity, only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor, the sunways corporation. sunways, on the other hand, constantly tries to unmask the digisoft-rats and recruit them again as double-spies. in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan; a seemingly colorless thirty-something employee who's been selected by sebastian rooks (the "uber-spy) to diddle the secret policies of both companies. trust me, it's actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali (the dude from "tube") carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters. the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem "seconds"
