i loved this movie!!! the characters were people that you could feel for. the young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. tom drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as donna reed as the love of his life. the looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well. the rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together. the most touching scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. i laughed in parts, cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. in fact i've re-watched it about 5 times. a definite must see for total romantics.
