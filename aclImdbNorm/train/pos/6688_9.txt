in the history of movies based on comic books, "mystery men" is one of the most underrated ones. this is no regular comic superhero movie! it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include mr. furious (played by ben stiller), the bowler (janeane garofalo), the shoveller (william h. macy), the blue rajah (hank azariah) and the spleen (paul reubens). "mystery men" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like "superman" or "batman," such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like bruce wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. so it looks as if director kinka usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. i found "mystery men" to be visually stimulating and very funny. even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!
