ok. there are people who should not see this movie.<br /><br />1) don't see it if you don't like satire or black humour. 2) don't like it if you got offended by _the watchmen_. 3) don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie.<br /><br />the rest of you, run, don't walk, to see _mystery men_. it's funny, it's quirky, it's a delightful sendup of every bad superhero cliche known to man. occasional forays into junior-high humour don't ruin the tongue-in-cheek low-key fun of jeanane garafalo, ben stiller, and hank azaria, as well as a couple of amusing smaller parts by geoffrey rush and greg kinnear. (good to see louise lasser getting work, too.) i laughed all the way through. utterly unserious, somewhat weird, but -good-.
