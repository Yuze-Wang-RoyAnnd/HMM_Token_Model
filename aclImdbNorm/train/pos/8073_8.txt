a brilliant portrait of a traitor (victor mclaglen in oscar winning performance) who is hounded by his own conscience. mclaglen plays an ira rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward during ireland's sinn fein rebellion. the scenes showing fights and mob actions are very realistic, focusing on the desperation within individuals. the lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death.<br /><br />director john ford superbly creates an murky and tense atmosphere, enhanced by the foggy and grimy depiction of the irish landscape. max steiner's dramatic music score adds to the cinematic delight. oscar winner also for best screenplay, nominated for best picture. this is one of hollywood's classic.
