if the redundancy of getting off the boat, on the boat, off the bus, on the bus.. is a way to waste time then you should go back to the hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots. and in doing so leave you unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life. the long drawn out travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and 'wait- in-line' feeling the characters must endure. frustrating? yes. vital? indeed. the limbo of that travel is the key to the 'rootlessness' of this turkish family. beautiful film with great acting. sad, but worth it.
