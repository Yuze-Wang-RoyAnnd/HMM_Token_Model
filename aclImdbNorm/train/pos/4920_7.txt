no, not really, but this is a very good film indeed, and is sadly a forgotten gem. black and white suits the film.<br /><br />straight forward formula, a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die.<br /><br />very well directed, and the acting is great. richard widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by paul douglas as the police captain, and jack palance (never better than this) and zero mostel as the baddies. sadly palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies.
