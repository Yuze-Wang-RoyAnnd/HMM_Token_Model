a good korean film about not just taekwondo but what its takes to be good, like a thugs way of fighting cannot beat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules, just as there are to life and school and this film has undertones of this notion.<br /><br />the martial arts in the film isn't that good but it is passable and enjoyable. friends who go on to achieve something they once would mock become stronger through the mind and heart. this film isn't meant to be taken too seriously as it does have slapstick, but it also carries a message.<br /><br />a good film again from korea.
