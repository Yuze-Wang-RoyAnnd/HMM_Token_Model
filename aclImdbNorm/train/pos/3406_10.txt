in terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding! i had no idea that technicolor came out so early. although i didn't like the ending, the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that i was in north africa. the cast is excellent and marlene dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and i just loved her in this flick. basil rathbone is also perfect in this movie. i couldn't get over the scenery and the sets... the hotel, the palm trees, the desert, it's all there... the legionnaires also bring a "beau geste" feeling to the film. they certainly don't make movies like these anymore. don't fail to watch this classic!
