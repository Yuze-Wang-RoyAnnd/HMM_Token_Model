oh wow. i saw this film at the irish international film fleadh in manhattan on 12 march 2000. both stars were in attendance and were available for questions afterward. what a gorgeous film! although set in ireland amid catholic/protestant antagonism, the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other. the horror of how quickly people can get carried away when they are given a chance to vent their hate and anger was woven beautifully with a moving love story drizzled with humor and fun. if this one does not get picked up in the usa, it would truly be most unfortunate.<br /><br />as for the stars and supporting players...first rate. they call orla brady the irish meryl streep, i heard. it is my opinion that she is better than meryl streep. they should be calling meryl the american orla brady! and, liam cunningham's steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliant.<br /><br />see this movie.
