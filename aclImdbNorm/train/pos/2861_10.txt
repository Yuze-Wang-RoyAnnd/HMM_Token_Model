i love this show and my 11 year-old daughter and i love watching it together. it teaches good old fashioned values in a fun, adventuresome and entertaining way (albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time). it's also really fun to make fun of...you know, rewind and insert your own dialog, in place of the actors'.<br /><br />i have my dvr set to record all the episodes and i happened to catch the tail end of an episode (just prior to the next one starting...so i don't know what episode it was) but there was an absolutely terrible sequencing mistake! adam had handed sheriff coffee a small swatch of "leather", which was torn from some outlaw's coat as he tried to make his getaway, i suppose.<br /><br />well, roy happened to have the coat, so he laid it out on his desk and placed the swatch right where it had been torn from. the swatch was exactly rectangular...which i reckon would be nearly impossible to tear from a piece of leather (post-1950's naugahyde? yes. leather? i don't think so). well, the swatch lined up perfectly and the mystery was solved.<br /><br />not 10 seconds later in the scene, we see the coat again, still lying on roy's desk. but this time the swatch is more like the shape of north carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which was smack-dab in the middle of the swatch) is now gone...as is the seam in the coat. my daughter enjoyed a good laugh as we played the short scene over and over and over again! it's prime for youtube, i tell ya!<br /><br />we still totally love the show though and the sequencing errors make it lots of fun!
