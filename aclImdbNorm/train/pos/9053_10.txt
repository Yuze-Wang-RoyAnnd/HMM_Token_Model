1.) this movie was amazing! i watched it while i was in the town next to the one where he grew up! i went and saw the buildings that the story took place in. overall, i loved this movie, one of jake gyllenhaal's best!! also- my favorite parts were the science fair, and all the times with his father. they were so sad, it seemed. homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn't seem to care one way or another. that tag line is true. "sometimes one dream is bright enough to light up the sky." 2.) the way this movie was shot was impeccable, it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950's. dress was accurate and they had their slang down too. definitely recommend this movie!
