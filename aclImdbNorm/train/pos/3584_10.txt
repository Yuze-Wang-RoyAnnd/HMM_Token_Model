my name is heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on. i want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it. as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were, it didn't really even come close to describing how bad things actually were. not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister. thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had,i truly appreciate them<br /><br />hi everyone!<br /><br />this is heather's mom. it's hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made. harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago. for any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation, please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel. our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you.
