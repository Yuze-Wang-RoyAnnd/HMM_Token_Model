i am not going to lie, this is a great movie. i saw it about 4 months ago at my local theatre. i saw it a second time, and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes. sid (the sloth) is not all that flattering, but diego (a mountain lion, i think) is really good in the movie. the animation is outstanding, and the story has a touching ending. it is worth taking kids 10 and under to, but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring. also, the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting. like i said, it is a pretty good movie, but i would rate "toy story 2" or "shrek" higher. 8/10
