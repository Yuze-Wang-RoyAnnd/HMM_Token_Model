i remember watching the disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch. plenty of other renditions, ever after put aside, of cinderella, have, in fact, lost their touch throughout the years. then i found this production with a flawless performance by kathleen turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood.<br /><br />we all know the story of cinderella, a young girl who's father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom. but this plot line takes a different twist in the classic fairy tale by causing cinderella (whose real name is zizola, and is only called cinderella by her family because of her slavery) to be trapped in a situation of her father (who still lives) slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step-daughters against his own and tries to poison him. thus, zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way. there, the bored prince valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress (forged by a water nymph named mab) with rose petals for slippers. <br /><br />what drew me to this film most of all was it's original take on the old fairy tale that none can compare to. it does not weave a web of lies like most cinderella stories, it does not ignore any reason as to why cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the prince as the disney version did. instead it shows more of cinderella's selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning! the costumes are all beautifully made, especially zizola's sapphire blue ballgown to match the marcella plunkett's fantastical beauty and soft, spirit-like voice. <br /><br />i would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic fairy tale with an interesting twist. my only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other fairy tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print.
