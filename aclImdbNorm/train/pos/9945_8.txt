first things first! this isn't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it! i think you can compare it to american sports movies! where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable,winning a game or tournament beyond expectation! in this case it isn't about football or baseball,but taekwondo! in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing! but soon we will find out that they don't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life! it is nice to see them struggle and training! i was surprised how funny this movie was! from start till the end you will laugh your pants off! the young korean actors are very convincing! go see this wonderful feel good movie!
