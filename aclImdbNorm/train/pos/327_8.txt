i've read one comment which labeled this film "trash" and "a waste<br /><br />of time." i think this person got their political undies tugged a bit<br /><br />too much.<br /><br />i just rented the new criterion dvd's of both yellow and blue.<br /><br />these films--although hardly great--have at least become of<br /><br />historical interest as to the so-called "radical student<br /><br />political-social movement"of the late '60s.<br /><br />i hadn't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation, i<br /><br />was expecting some real porn (there isn't any.) there is frontal<br /><br />nudity (including the still verboten frontal male nudity (automatic<br /><br />nc-17--the orwellian-x) in the u.s. but i wasn't expecting the films<br /><br />in-your-face democratic socialist message.<br /><br /> though it tends to the simplistic , i thought it occassionally made<br /><br />its points well. both films occassionally had me laughing out loud<br /><br />and the director's commentary made it clear there was plenty of<br /><br />parody in the film. especially the supposedly "pornographic" sex<br /><br />scenes. the first such scene is very realistic. the lead couple is<br /><br />clumsy, inept, funny and endearing in their first copulation scene.<br /><br />the second--which caused the most complaints--has faked<br /><br />cunnilingus and fellatio. and the last is the end of an angry fight,<br /><br />that is believable.<br /><br />the extras include an informative introduction to the film, an<br /><br />interview with the original american distributor and his attorney,<br /><br />excerpts from trial testimony in the u.s. and a "diary" commentary<br /><br />by the director on some scenes.<br /><br />this is the film that "blue noses" wouldn't let alone and led to the<br /><br />pivotal "prurient interest with no social redeeming value" standard<br /><br />that, thankfully, still stands.<br /><br />those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must<br /><br />see.
