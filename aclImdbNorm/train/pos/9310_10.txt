wow, how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes? it was surely the highlight of my year--nay--my life. as if the raptor graphics weren't amazing enough, the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie, even when the background didn't actually match up with the setting of the scene. wow, what genius. and while the movie is full of plot-holes (for instance, a few clips of a t-rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where pappy finds a torture chamber, screams "colin's a girl!" and runs out) i will never forget the brilliance that is raptor planet. thank you sci-fi for another classic.
