this movie really is a mixed bag. on the one hand, the story and concept of the movie are really good, tense and have some nice plot twists in it. but than again on the other hand, it all is told very slow, without style and uninvolved. still i regard "just cause" as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast.<br /><br />maybe sean connery was miscast in his role. i mean, he isn't really that believable as a the main 'hero' and father of a young daughter (played by a still very young scarlett johansson by the way) and husband of kate capshaw. i feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it. however sean connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does. but he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like laurence fishburne, blair underwood, ned beatty, hope lange, lynne thigpen and ed harris. all actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time, which is a real shame, as well as a missed opportunity. especially ed harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer. he's truly chilling and acting superbly. normally he doesn't play this ruthless, chilling sort of roles in movies, so he really surprises with his role in this one. his performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie. however due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic, none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant.<br /><br />it really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential. arne glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times. because of this, we as viewers, never really get involved with the story or any of it's characters.<br /><br />it really is too bad, for "just cause" had more than enough potential. a fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems. the cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller, that will probably still please the fan of the genre. it however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style, or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genre.<br /><br />7/10
