yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there, but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it. tim meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the saturday night live show. whenever he would do this character on the show i would crack up laughing. so after i saw this was going to be playing on comedy central one night i decided to check it out. all in all i was farily impressed with this movie, because it wasn't meant to win any oscars or become comedy of the year, but it did entertain the saturday night live fans that love the ladies man character. this movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come.
