according to this board, i guess either you love it or hate it. usually how it goes with all movies. there is no need to get testy with others though. all we are doing here is giving opinions. i rented this movie last night and i want to come and throw my opinion in the mix. i was surprised by how many people are thrashing it though. there's a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. i'm a horror movie fan. most plain ol'e' movie fans don't like horror movies. so many low budget cam corder looking movies are coming out these days. it's hard to keep up. and what makes it tough to stay into these movies is how bad they are. i wanted to come and write a review about "hood of the living dead" because it's pretty damn good compared to the rest of the junk out there. it's nothing special but it's those horror film makers that try to be too serious that end up making a horrible horror film. i really liked this one. you telling me there is no effort in this one? and one more thing, i bet all of you have all of these huge dvd collections that you are so proud of, nothing but major motion pictures right? nothing wrong with that, but you have to know how to appreciate low-budget independent. i knew what i was getting when i watched this movie. i'm not going to be upset because i thought it was going to be some 100 million dollar movie. some of you might need to stick with watching the matrix over and over again and stop trying to compare everything to the matrix. and if most of you are under 24, that explains everything. good movie folks, check it out.
