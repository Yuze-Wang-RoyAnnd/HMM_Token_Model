i just watched this for the first time in a long time - i had forgotten both how imaginative the images were, and how witty the movie is. i had not forgotten however the opening scenes which are (with the scene at the candlelight club in waterloo bridge) among the most romantic ever filmed.<br /><br />anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie's offhand references - anyone interested in romance will be moved by hunter-niven, and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworld.<br /><br />my favorite movie remains "odd man out" made near the same time - but this one is superb. <br /><br />
