24 has got to be the best spy/adventure series tv had ever aired. the whole idea of telling a story in a 24 hour real time period is dazzling. the style of filming and pacing is what hooks us to watch it. and jack bauer is one of the greatest protagonists in a tv series in a long time. i rate this, along with the simpsons and the x-files, my three most favorite tv series.<br /><br />this first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate us senator david palmer who is also running for president. bauer is called to his office in order to discover who is behind all this and, at the same time, figure his daughter's path to the unkwown after fleeing from her bedroom. thus, begins an adventure on the best political style and, what's best of it, is that it always takes place in real time, which makes this tv series a real work of originality in a time where almost every program on tv seems to be showing us the same things over and over and over.
