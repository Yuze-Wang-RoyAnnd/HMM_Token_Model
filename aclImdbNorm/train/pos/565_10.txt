this first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement, romance, and james stewart to the screen. "the far country" is the only one out of all five stewart-mann westerns that is often overlooked. stewart, yet again, puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five stewart-mann westerns. jeff webster (stewart) is uncaring, always looking out for himself, which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him. ironically, he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. this displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick, ben tatum, played by walter brennan, since tatum is the one that gave it to him. mann, yet again, puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart-mann westerns. he displays violence, excitement, plot twists, romance, and corruption. the story is that jeff and ben, through a series of events, wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson, along with gold partners calvet and flippen, and no-good but beautiful roman and her hired men. they are unable to leave, because crooked sheriff mr. gannon (mcintire) and his "deputies" will hang them, since the only way out is through skagway, which is gannon's town. but, eventually, mcintire comes to them, but not to collect stewart and/or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government. what is mcintire there for? he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money. people are killed. a sheriff for dawson is considered needed, and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun. stewart, however, refuses the job, because he plans to get all the gold he can, and then pull out. he also refuses it because he does not like to help people, since law and order always gets somebody killed. so, flippen is elected instead. a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannon's men, a purely evil, mustachioed fancy gunman named madden, who carries two guns, played by wilke. flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done, but he cannot stand up to him, so he becomes the town drunk. a man named yukon replaces flippen. stewart and tatum start to pull out, but are ambushed by gannon's men. tatum is killed, and stewart is wounded. stewart finally realizes that he must do something, or gannon will take over dawson, set up his own rules, and it will become his town, just like skagway. the audience also realizes what stewart must do. another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon. if stewart leaves, gannon would take over the town. if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it, the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly. this is where a great scene occurs. stewart walks into his cabin. he has a sling on his arm. for a few seconds, his gun, in the gunbelt, is hanging on a post beside his bed, the gun is close up, stewart is in the background, just inside the door. he stares at it for a few seconds. he tosses the sling away. the sling lands on the back of a chair, and falls to the floor. this is symbolic, because he is throwing away his old life, which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself. he comes into his new life, of helping people when they need help. what ends the film is a guns-blazing, furious show of good against evil, and a genuinely feel-good feeling that everything will be alright.
