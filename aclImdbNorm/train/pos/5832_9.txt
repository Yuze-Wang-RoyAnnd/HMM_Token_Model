ever since seeing this film as a child, over 30 years ago, i never tire of watching it. from the opening scenes in the horn factory, to the car motor running from the back seat of the car, to ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out the window by stan, i think this was perhaps their best latter day film. after this they moved to 20th century fox, and while those films weren't terrible, they lacked the comic timing of this movie. jimmy finnlayson, their long time foil, in his last appearance with the boys, showing up as the doctor is super! quote: " i said goat milk " his reply to stan asking him how do you milk a ghost! charlie hall and even ben turpin show up! i'd say all in all one of my favorite l & h comedies.
