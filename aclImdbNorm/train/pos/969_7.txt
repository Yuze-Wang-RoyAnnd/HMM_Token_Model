miike makes a children's adventure film, not unlike the neverending story. it's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films. even the worst miike is better than a good many films, though, and the great yokai war has a lot in it that's worth recommending. it's at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks. i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it (the dvd includes an english dub), but, like all of miike's films, it can tend to move very slowly. that means you've got kind of a weird unevenness, where sometimes there's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse. the story itself isn't very good, either, and miike's perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head. most of what i liked came from the technical side of things. this has to be miike's most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic. "yokai" are japanese spirits, and they come in all different, fantastical forms, and the costume designers, special effects crew, and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job. i've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on (yokai monsters: spook warfare), and the cheesy rubber-suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state-of-the-art makeup and special effects. i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), agi, who sports dark eye shadow, a tight, white outfit, a white beehive hairdo and a whip. she's played, incidentally, by chiaki kuriyama, whom you might remember as lucy liu's teenage henchgirl in kill bill: vol. 1. the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki, who provided voices for miyazaki's spirited away and howl's moving castle.
