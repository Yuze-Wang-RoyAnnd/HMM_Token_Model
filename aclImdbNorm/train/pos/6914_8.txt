this movie contains one of richard dreyfuss's greatest performances, as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor. also, this movie is funny, yet has a serious side as well. what is especially intriguing about this movie is the character madonna, who is the dictator's mistress, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. madonna's evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movie's entertainment value. and the main character, who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon, evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect. i liked this movie.
