i give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting "guess who" game. the movie, however, needs more robin in it. he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest. i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character, let alone knightwing. this movie just continues that bad tradition. the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which wouldn't be so bad in one movie if the romance wasn't so unbelievable. it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it.
