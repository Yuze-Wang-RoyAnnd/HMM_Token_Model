sandler is amazing again... i have already become a sandler fan. this movie is the saddest sandler story. its expression is fantastic. i cried more watching click but there are some similar points. to consider the value of the family before losing it and to be able to say 'i love you' are a few of the most impressive truths in life... it is tough, it is real... and actually there is a real owner of this success, binder. i don't think another director could give these emotions in such a way. <br /><br />cheadle and burrows are also amazing... cheadle is one of my favorites since crash. don't expect laughing or much positive atmosphere... if you are ready to face the realities of life, don't miss this movie.
