katherine heigl, marley shelton, denise richards, david boreanaz. even before i knew what this film was about, these names were enough to draw me in. gorgeous, talented and popular, these are performers to look out for.<br /><br />ok, where do i start. we already know what the film is about. five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher, a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago. his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards, maggot-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose. his weapon of choice: well, take a pick - axe, knife, electric powerdrill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. ok, so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality.<br /><br />horror movies aren't supposed to be shakespeare, but i'm not gonna go there. i love horror movies, but not all of them. this one, i adore. it's up there with some of my other favorites. it's funny, sexy and scary. the killer's mask is childishly creepy, and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky. the acting is topnotch: denise richards, marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun. i really did wish to see much, much more of katherine heigl. i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon. jessica capshaw is a very capable actress, and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2. the smaller parts were also good; hedy buress was a hoot ('bleedmedry.com') and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like her.<br /><br />highlights: every death scene had a particular distinction to it. the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue. the hottub scene, while ludicrous, was well done. and the audiovisual maze was sinister. the soundtrack is great, with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes.<br /><br />lowpoint: i felt as though the killer wasn't featured enough, we barely saw the mask, and it wasn't featured at all during the climax. i also thought the climax was really unfocused, but fun nonetheless.<br /><br />the twist at the end wasn't that big of a surprise, but i'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routine.<br /><br />i don't like to tell people which movies they should see, but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing, then valentine would be it.<br /><br />my rating: 10/10 (bullseye!)
