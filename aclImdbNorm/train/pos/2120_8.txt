james stewart and margaret sullavan play co-workers in a budapest gift shop who don't really like each other, not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet.<br /><br />a very charming romantic comedy, very engagingly played by it's two likable stars and a very eager-to-please supporting cast. the story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence (don't quite know how to explain it) that films today just don't have. this can obviously be compared to the recent you've got mail, and the original wins in every way.<br /><br />this is mandatory viewing each christmas, i can't think of a better way to jumpstart a christmas feel than this little gem.
