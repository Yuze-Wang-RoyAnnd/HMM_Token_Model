the first collaboration between schoedsack & cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the bakhtiari tribe of persia. twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to get to pasture. you'll feel like a pampered weakling after watching these people herd their animals through ice cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains while trying to get their animals to walk along steep and narrow mountain paths.
