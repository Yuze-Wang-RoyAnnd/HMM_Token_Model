the title is onomatopoeic, the sound of a streetcar clacking on the rails. it is metaphoric for all that the people who live in the dump cannot have. the misery of those people is illustrated by the passing streetcar which represents the relatively unobtainable rich life of the middle class. the pathos of the little boy and his beloved yet sadly insane father is most touching. this was kurosawa's first film in colour and he uses beautifully shocking hues, colours seen only in dreams. the movie is surreal and surpassing in beauty. the compassion for humanity is the underling force, but as always, kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film. it is a masterwork by a genius of cinema.
