the surprise nominee of this year's best animated feature race at the oscars. it's an irish film by heart, but it was co-produced by belgium and brazil, with, i'm guessing, animators working in all three countries. the product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. the character design is a little reminiscent of the french animated film persepolis from a couple of years back, with very simple characters with thick, black outlines. this film is not in black and white. oh no. what makes this film great is its use of color, simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors i've ever seen. the general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical, with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals. much of the film can be spent playing find the circle - a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image. all of these geometrical designs have a purpose - the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (the book of kells is a real illuminated bible; the art of the film is based on the drawings in it). the story of the film isn't especially deep, but it's a pretty good fantasy tale. brendan is a young boy in kells, a city surrounded by enormous walls, built by his uncle to keep out vikings. a newcomer to kells, brother aiden, inspires brendan to take up illustrating. he also inspires him to do things like leave kells and explore the nearby forest, within which lives a nymph. bruno coulais provides a fantastic score, almost as good as the one he did for coraline, which i consider the very best of the year.
