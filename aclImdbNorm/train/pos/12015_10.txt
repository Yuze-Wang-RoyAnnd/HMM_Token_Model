thought at first this film would be your typical western film, however, it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end, which turned out very unusual. charlton heston,(sam burgade),"midway",'76, had past experiences with james coburn,(zach provo),"deadfall",'93, and zach never forgave sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back. unfortunately, barbara hershey,(susan burgade),"the portrait of a lady",'96, managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone. sam burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and i was quite surprised at the conclusion. this is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding.
