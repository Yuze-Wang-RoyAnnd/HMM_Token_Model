"purple rain" has never been a critic's darling but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be. if you are a prince fan this is for you.<br /><br />the main plot is prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl. believe it or not this movie isn't just singing and dancing. there are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming. sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works. very hit and miss.<br /><br />no one can really act in the film. everyone is from one of prince's side acts like "the time" and "vanity 6". still, it adds charm to the movie. when ever prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /><br />in conclusion, go and see this if you love prince like me. if you aren't a fan it'll make you one.
