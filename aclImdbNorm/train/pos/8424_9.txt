that's my bush is a live action project made by south park creators trey parker and matt stone.the show was cancelled after one season, not because of bad reviews(it actually got good reviews), but because it was very expensive.that's my bush is a pretty funny spoof of an average network tv sitcom.it is also a political satire.now, this is nowhere near as good as south park, but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire.the guy who plays in that's my bush looks a lot like him! if you can find the show, check it out.there are plenty of laughs to be had!<br /><br />9/10
