this series it's "something different". sometimes european series are less accurate than the usa ones, but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way. edel & starck is great, it has all: great plot, smart, witty, always well delivered lines, an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of berlin, one of the most interesting city in the world. it's entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the usa and for once "feel" the old europe way of dealing with life. kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to come.watching the series in german is super.
