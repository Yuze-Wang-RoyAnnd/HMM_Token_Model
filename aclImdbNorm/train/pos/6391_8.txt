caught this film at the arizona international film festival. i wasn't expecting a lot (though the festival's director told me it was one of the best films submitted). five minutes into it i was sold. shot in b & w on a shoestring budget, this film is hilarious. the acting is solid, the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid. the acting is probably the biggest revelation, since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting. not this one. it features one of the most convincing, endearing and funny portrayals of a character with tourette's syndrome i've ever seen. the plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous. if you get the chance, see this movie. filmmakers like majkowski (hope i got that right) deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience.
