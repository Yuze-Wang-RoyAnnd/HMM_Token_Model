i admit, the first time i watched even cowgirls get the blues, i didn't think it was very memorable in any regard. but now after viewing it the 7th time, i admit that it has very much grown on me. the characters of sissy, ms. jellybean, and the countess have become very endearing. and the romance between sissy and jellybean seems very sweet. though the plot is very weak, i think the satirical humor more than makes up for it. then there's the kick-ass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented k.d. lang (who reminds me a little of patsy cline) at her best. i can't think of any movie that has "grown on me" after an inauspicious first impression, as much as cowgirls has.
