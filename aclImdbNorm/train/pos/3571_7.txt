i've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it. this one ought to be a cult fave! the best line, "your dress is deeply cool!" says the prince to cinderella. kathleen turner shines as the stepmother. i also like the 1950's era cars and motorcycles. the melancholy prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler. he tries to stay cool, but fails to hide his love for the fairy-tale princess-to-be. her slipper is not glass (truer to the original story), but cinderella loses is nonetheless but gets it back from the heir to the throne. my only complaint is that it is not shown more and seems to be almost impossible to get. hopefully blockbuster or amazon will start stocking this one sometime soon.
