(spoilers?)<br /><br />while the historical accuracy might be questionable... (and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr.. such things are more easily excused now) i liked the art ness of it. though not really an art house film. it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time. <br /><br />i have two complaints. 1. it's too short. and 2. the voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />quality: 10/10 entertainment: 7/10 replayable: 5/10
