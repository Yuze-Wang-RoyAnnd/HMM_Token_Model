gruveyman2 (comment below)you are a complete idiot...blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to. its that whiny arrogance, that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about sf, that makes you seem like such the typical la a**hole! the only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about sf is because you are jealous. of course you don't know it because you are so la jaded. first of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city; what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals. it says nothing bad about la; and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over la. they recognize that they went to film school in la and are obviously proud of that fact. they recognize that sf is close to la which is a benefit. the only negative thing that was said that relates to la, was about the studio executives. the same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them, but then those same movies went on to be huge world-wide grossing films. so why wouldn't they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system? these are the only people they are trying to "disassociate from" and for good reasons! don't be so sensitive! how can you say that francis ford coppola is the "so called" san francisco director? how is he not to be considered that? and who directed the godfather? coppola did. it was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award. so what who gave him the job? he admits it in the documentary that he didn't even want to do the movie....so what's your point? and so what if sophia wants to live in la? and that proves your point how? and tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies. movies that are now considered classics. and, when they made movies from studio funding, one, it was la that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two, they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own. they said exactly that in the film.<br /><br />"your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film."<br /><br />how the hell can "bitchy-ness" and "self-congratulation" suddenly have an "air" of self respect and credence....if they never go to la again? what a stupid and senseless comment! you inserted some big words in there....and just don't know how to use them! and, by the way, they never claimed nor implied they were superior to la! so what if they are giving a guy from new york an award in la....again what the hell is your point? so if they go to la or new york they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in sf? you make no sense.<br /><br />san francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today. this film just focused on one aspect...film-making. for you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city (not the movie! but the city and its people) only proves what it is we northern californians hate about people from la! this is a great documentary...very interesting, especially if you are from the bay area...but i recommend it to anyone.
