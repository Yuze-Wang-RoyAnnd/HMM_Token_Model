fred gwynne, al lewis, sid caesar, and yvonne de carlo star in this funny, funny movie. the late fred gwynne is truly wonderful as herman munster who lives with grandpa munster (al lewis), wife lily (yvonne de carlo), and his son and daughter. sid caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the munster family. when the wax figures of herman and grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two. the two now have to clear their names before it's too late. you'll laugh out loud just like i did.
