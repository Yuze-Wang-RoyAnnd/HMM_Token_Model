i happen to run into this movie one night so i decided to watch it! i was very pleased with the movie... i thought it was a wonderful plot. it's a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say! and this wife stayed devoted for 23 years!!! i thought it was a great movie!!
