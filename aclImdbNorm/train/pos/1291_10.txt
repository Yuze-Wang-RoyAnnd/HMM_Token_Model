this is a good movie. something fun about watching money be blown at a super rate, especially from a kid's point of view. take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a kid's dream coming true, and what a kid might do with $1 million dollars. don't like it, don't watch it. they make movies for the watchers, not the people that have nothing better to do then complain in their lives.
