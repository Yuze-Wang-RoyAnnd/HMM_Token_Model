calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading. the genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable.<br /><br />the shop around the corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern-european atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the (also strong) nominal leads; i avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example mr. matuschek (frank morgan) has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance.<br /><br />the 1998 film you've got mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen-pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake. this is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all.
