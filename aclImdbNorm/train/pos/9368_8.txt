i just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago, and i was very happy with the movie when i left it. it's very intense, and the closest i've come to crying in a movie in quite some time. that is a credit to adam sandler, who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels, and who probably deserves an oscar nom for it, were it not coming out so early in the year. don cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to adam's disturbed.<br /><br />there is some humor, but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments, as adam deals with his loss and don struggles to help him. adam plays two levels very well... when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable, but when he is, well, less stable he's powerful and dark.<br /><br />i recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss.
