here's what i knew about "atlantis" before watching it:<br /><br />* - it's officially disney's first animated sci-fi adventure. i'm not sure how accurate that is (i like to nitpick) but it made me curious first time i heard it described.<br /><br />* - the preview looked, for the most part, damn cool. evidently, it was also "too cryptic" according to some critics after the fact.<br /><br />* - it apparently did so badly that disney said, "screw it, let's re-release 'spy kids'".<br /><br />so, with all that said, how is the movie?<br /><br />hella-cool.<br /><br />i'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway, but "atlantis" goes all out. it's a throwback to all the cgi eye-candy shots in "beauty and the beast" and "aladdin", so much so that it's almost an effects animator's best-of show. the characters maybe aren't that memorable (except, perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot's a little dull, but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot.<br /><br />here's a controversy that bothers me. the "failure" (as in, it "only" took in, like, five-hundred-million or something; i know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that) of this movie compared to the popularity of "shrek" and "monsters inc." has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation. i don't think that's true. how do you account for the "south park" movie? what about "final fantasy"? really, the story and the artistry is everything, not the method. i don't know what disney's comeback movie will be like, but i don't think they're out of the picture yet.
