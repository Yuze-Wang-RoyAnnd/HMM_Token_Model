this is what i call a growth movie. every character is different and better at the end- and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "tub of love". josie lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes. even the men in this film go from being self-centered to better men. the book stayed very true to the novel, which is a plus in my book, since i am a librarian. the scenery breath-taking and the message of love genuine.
