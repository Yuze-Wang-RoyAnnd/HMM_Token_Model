i have to say despite it's reviews angels in the outfield was a pretty good movie. i like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen. unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting. though i liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy (i.e. towards the end when ray mitchell hits a homer he doesn't step on the plate and therefore that wouldn't be a score. but that's just nitpicking.) i have to say i was really impressed with this movie's presence and moral: just have faith, don't give up.
