tom hanks like you've never seen him before. hanks plays michael sullivan, "the angel of death". he is a hitman for his surrogate father john rooney(paul newman)an elderly irish mob boss. sullivan's young son(tyler hoechlin)witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of sullivan's wife and other son. enter jude law as a reporter/photographer willing to kill sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters. filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30's. sometimes the pace bogs down, but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story. director sam mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son. other notable cast members are: dylan baker, stanley tucci, daniel craig and jennifer jason leigh. hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie. make room for some oscars!
