off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don't make statements like the above lightly. secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to bruno (rats, night of terror) mattei. this is no dawn of the dead folks.<br /><br />that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen. <br /><br />the script is wonderfully horrible. just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote ("let's try putting these two molecules together"). <br /><br />the zombies come in all varieties. from moaning shufflers, to machete wielding maniacs, to birds! <br /><br />the gore is plentiful. legs are bitten off, arms amputated, stomachs burst open. <br /><br />the pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. <br /><br />then there's the head in the fridge. oh the head in the fridge! one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead 2.<br /><br />you should know already whether you're the sort of person who's going to like this sort of film. get some mates and some beer and you'll be in for a fun night.<br /><br />did i mention the head in the fridge?!?!?
