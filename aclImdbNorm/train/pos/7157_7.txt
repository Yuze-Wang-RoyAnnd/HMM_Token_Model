this film is an entertaining, fun and quality film. the film very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book, and tries to stick to the exact lines. the actors are all suitable, and you would expect them to be the part. they use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film. the graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film. there is no such thing as a yellow spotted lizard, for example. the camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book, and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book. all of his group are mentioned a lot in the book, but are not in the film. overall, a great film for a rainy afternoon
