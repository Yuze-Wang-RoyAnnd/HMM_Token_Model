marlene gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors. this sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that writer's dark irony. john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance (i am usually not a fan of his); and emily watson is brilliant as well. well worth seeing.
