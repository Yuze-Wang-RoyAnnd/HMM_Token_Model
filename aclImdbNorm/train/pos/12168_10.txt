"a guy thing" may not be a classic, but it sure is a good, funny comedy. the plot focuses on paul (jason lee), who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and becky (julia stiles) lying naked in his bed. before he can figure out what happened, he rushes becky out of his apartment because his fiance karen (selma blair) is coming. after that, as you could imagine, chaos ensues.<br /><br />almost every single scene in "a guy thing" delivers loud laughs. the funniest moments come from when paul imagines what could happen if he tells karen. selma blair is a truly talented comedian, and the worst thing about this film is that she goes underused. although, she turns out to be more funny than stiles' character, who actually isn't that interesting. of course, not every comedy is perfect.<br /><br />as i said, "a guy thing" is no classic, but it's not bad either, 7/10.
