many of the classic films of the late '60s haven't retained their ability to disturb and confront the audience. "in cold blood" hasn't lost an ounce of its power. its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think. some have complained not only about the film, but about truman capote's source "non-fiction novel", that the central message is unsubtle. that may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity doesn't detract from the film at all. its refreshing, especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a film with a convinced political voice unafraid to force the audience to consider its viewpoint. to be honest, i'm not sure if i agree with the film's central message, but i admire its audacity nonetheless.<br /><br />even if you disagree with the anti-capital punishment message, there's plenty to admire about the film. the acting from the two leads is terrific. scott wilson (still one of the most underrated actors ever) is chilling as the nihilistic leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. robert blake is also chilling as the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience. his character obviously has a voice of reason, but is terrified to go against wilson (theres a good amount of homoerotic subtext on his character's part). the cinematography is terrific, sleek yet gritty and really giving the impression the viewer is watching a documentary. add another classic score from quincey jones, and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
