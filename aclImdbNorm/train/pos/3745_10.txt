many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path: murder most foul, gathering of clues, gaggle of possible perps, sprinkling of red herrings, and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver.<br /><br />"forgotten" abandons the well-trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts. the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some, but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes, disturbs, and haunts with the question: what does an evil person look like?<br /><br />excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily... forgotten.
