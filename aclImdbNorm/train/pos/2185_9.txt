poor basil rathbone, an egotistical composer who's lost his muse. he's been faking it for some time, buying his lyrics and his music from various sources. trouble is that two of the sources (bing crosby music) and (mary martin words) happen to meet and fall in love. and then they discover what they've been doing. complications ensue, but all is righted at the end.<br /><br />crosby and martin sing terrifically. mary had signed a paramount contract and also at the same time doubled as a regular on crosby's kraft music hall radio show. for reasons i don't understand, movie audiences didn't take to her, so she went back to broadway and did one touch of venus in 1944 and stayed there.<br /><br />basil rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well. his ego is constantly being deflated by sidekick oscar levant and again i'm surprised they didn't do more films together.<br /><br />as in most of crosby's paramount vehicles, no big production numbers, but i agree with the previous reviewer about the title tune being done as an impromptu jam session in a pawn shop. good job by all.<br /><br />a surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
