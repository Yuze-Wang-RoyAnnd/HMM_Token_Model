well-made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert, writer/director pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! <br /><br />the acting is uniformly excellent, however; despite their relatively young age, huppert and co-star gerard depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern french stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still hold to this day.<br /><br />i have 3 more of pialat's films in my "vhs to watch" pile, albeit all in french without english subtitles; due to this fact but also loulou's oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - i can't say that i'm in any particular hurry to check them out now...
