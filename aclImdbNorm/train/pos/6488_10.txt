war is hell. but this documentary of wwii is heaven.<br /><br />not only is this series a breath-taking, almost-exhaustive look at the second world war, it's a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivier.<br /><br />this documentary series defines the genre. it's sweepingly long, no doubt, but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more. (i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a year).<br /><br />truly, this is an impeccable bit of film-making. other than olivier, the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories; whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper.<br /><br />i'm going to go watch it right now (again, my... 11th time).
