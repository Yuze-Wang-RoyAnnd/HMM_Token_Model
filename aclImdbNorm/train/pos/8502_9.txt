gung ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again. michael keaton is put in charge of wooing a japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of hadleyville. what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another. the two cultures clash and it is up to keaton to hold things together. look for great performances from keaton, gedde watanabe, george wendt, mimi rogers, john turturro, soh yamamura and sab shimomo. all are perfectly cast. don't be fooled by the low number rating. this is a 7.5 in my book. it is interesting to note that the town name of hadleyville was also used in high noon. yes, there is a real hadleyville but in oregon.
