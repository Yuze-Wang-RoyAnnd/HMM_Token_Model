this movie has it all, action, fighting, dancing, bull riding, music, pretty girls. this movie is an authenic look at middle america. believe me, i was there in 1980. lots of oil money, lots of women, and lots of honky tonks. too bad they are all gone now. the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, but it is redeemed by the actors and the music. there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie, and that includes american graffiti. it is a movie i watch over and over again and never get tired of it. every time i watch it, i am young again, and it is time to go out honky tonking. the only reason i only gave it a 9 is because you cannot rate a movie zero, i do not feel you should rate one 10.
