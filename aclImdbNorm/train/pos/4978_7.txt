a nice shirely temple short. child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. perhaps being "seen and not heard" needed to be made up for. aside from that this is fun. given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as both very progressive and liberal. i won't go into those here, i'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for temple. that makes it worth watching if you're a temple fan. for others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove.
