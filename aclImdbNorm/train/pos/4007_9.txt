a fierce, shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer hanif kureishi who wrote "my beautiful laundrette", (this is the best thing he's done since then). it's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up to much. they've squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels. the only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex. he has his own motives but kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion. this is a film in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen. in some respects it's a bit like "sunday, bloody sunday" but it's an altogether tougher piece of work. the director, roger michell, allows scenes to build instinctively. and it is beautifully acted.<br /><br />as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture. there is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived-in performance, and that very fine actor daniel craig displays shadings to his character than even kureishi hasn't tapped into. if the film strikes a false note it is, perhaps, in the character of the talentless daughter, caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces (or should that be the other way round) and even messier life, but she is so well played by cathryn bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless. the film is also extremely beautiful to look at (dop alwin kuchler) and must rank, unhesitatingly, as the best british film of the year.
