this is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate. it has good acting, lots of gore, and a decent plot. one will be reminded of movies like the hills have eyes and pumpkinhead. it's obvious that the budget was not all that big, but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors, which seems to be lacking in a lot of today's big budget special effects-filled films. the film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work. there are no wasted scenes, so the film's length is a bit short. in addition, it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel, which would be very interesting as well. so grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this one.
