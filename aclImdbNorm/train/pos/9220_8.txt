a delightfully unpretentious send up of romeo and juliet. approach with no expectations other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one. a talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light-hearted performers' vehicle. bad reviews were due to a snobbishness about treatments of shakespeare. some people feel that all film must be "important" ---if you share those views, don't bother. the credits read "introducing" angelina jolie, which is not even close to being true, but she is astoundingly beautiful as the juliet character, and, as always, her acting is wonderful--- and, considering her age at the time, even her dialect is pretty good. recreating this classic tale with feuding italian families in the catering business in new york results in great fun. see it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud.
