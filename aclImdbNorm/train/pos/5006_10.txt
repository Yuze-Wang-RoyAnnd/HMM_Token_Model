i remember stumbling upon this special while channel-surfing in 1965. i had never heard of barbra before. when the show was over, i thought "this is probably the best thing on tv i will ever see in my life." 42 years later, that has held true. there is still nothing so amazing, so honestly astonishing as the talent that was displayed here. you can talk about all the super-stars you want to, this is the most superlative of them all!<br /><br />you name it, she can do it. comedy, pathos, sultry seduction, ballads, barbra is truly a story-teller. her ability to pull off anything she attempts is legendary. but this special was made in the beginning, and helped to create the legend that she quickly became. in spite of rising so far in such a short time, she has fulfilled the promise, revealing more of her talents as she went along. but they are all here from the very beginning. you will not be disappointed in viewing this.
