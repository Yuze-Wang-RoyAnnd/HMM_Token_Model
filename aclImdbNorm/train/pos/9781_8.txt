i had initially heard of tears of kali a while back and it sounded like something i'd be into, but with all the films i have coming in on a regular basis, it kinda fell off my radar. while roaming around the local wonderbook...i spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up. i have to say i'm pretty glad i did. tears of kali is a strange, gory, sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch.<br /><br />tears of kali centers around the fictional india-based taylor-erikkson cult group, that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individual's "inner demons" - but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough (depending on your viewpoint...) as dark forces are not only exorcised, but also unleashed upon hapless victims.<br /><br />the film is told "anthology-style", with a short but memorable and "eye-opening" intro sequence, and then proceeding into the three stories that make up the bulk of the film.<br /><br />the first (shakti) is about a journalist who visits one of the cult-members who is being held at a mental hospital. the journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the taylor-erikkson cult, but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home. when the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head...<br /><br />the second part (devi) concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehab in lieu of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma. we find that the treating doctor in question is actually a taylor-erikkson "alumni", and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm...<br /><br />the closing story (kali) revolves around a quack "faith-healer" and his assistant who perform "miracles" for a fee. when the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her, the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new host...<br /><br />i gotta say i really enjoyed tears of kali. there are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent - but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is. my biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired over-dubbed dialogue. the dubbing is sub-par and i would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track. some reviewers have said the acting is poor, which i don't necessarily agree with. i think that the dubbing is so lack-luster that it makes the performances seem stunted, which isn't really the case. in fact, a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling (the "doctor" in the second segment, and the "client" in the third readily come to mind...) and notable. the gore fx are very well done for a low-budget film, with some graphic scenes of eyelid-removal-via-cuticle-scissors, a pencil-in-the-throat-suicide, some decent (but irritatingly "shaky") self-flaying, and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure. not as rough as some of the more "extreme" gore films out there, but definitely stronger than your average horror fare. i also found the story concerning the cult-group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror-story nonsense. there are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension, the likes of which i haven't come across in a while. although flawed in some fundamental ways, i still think tears of kali will appeal to most "underground" horror viewers - some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer. definitely recommended - 8.5/10
