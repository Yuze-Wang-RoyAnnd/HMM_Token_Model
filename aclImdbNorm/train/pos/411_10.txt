this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is (5.9/10(576 votes) as of this writing). this movie has incredible special effects, a true epic storyline, complex great character interaction, and mind-blowing battles - they have to be seen to be believed! the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got (some lines were not translated - ???).<br /><br />i just don't understand when i read & hear from various sources: "it has a confusing plot....", "i couldn't follow the story...." or "characters came from nowhere...". from the very 1st time i watched this movie, i understood it, followed it, knew why characters were there, and i absolutely loved it! i've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment. oh, and this is not just my opinion, because i've shown this movie to many fellow americans (people who have never seen an hk film before) who feel the same way. not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie. oh man, why can't we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood? at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects, character development, and storyline.<br /><br />this is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either. i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds. when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie. you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you won't want to leave! i've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 (both done by tsui hark), and the 2001 is far better in comparison imo.<br /><br />besides the subtitles, i have one additional complaint about this movie: i didn't want it to end.... i'm begging you mr. hark - can we please have a sequel?
