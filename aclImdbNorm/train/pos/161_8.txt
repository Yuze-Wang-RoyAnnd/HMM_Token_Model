this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences. its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads. chasing the big murder case, you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime. no nudity, but lots of sexual implication, slapstick silliness...everything adolescents go for. low budget, but very entertaining. definite cult classic potential.
