david duchovny and michelle forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to california, but can't really afford to, so they 'ride share" with another young couple (brad pitt and juliette lewis) to save on expenses. the idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way, sites where serial killers did their thing, since brian (duchovny) is a writer and carrie (forbes) is his photographer. what they don't know is that pitt (earley) and lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever he says. i don't care for pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles. the scary thing is that he does them so well; i've actually known people like him before, no, not killers, but with pretty much the same mindset. anyway, as the road trip goes along, carrie guesses that the others are about out of money, but earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow....never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though. lewis does her role well, one that she excels at, a not-too-bright waif that has a good heart but doesn't understand that she doesn't have to put up with being beaten up by earley when she does something he doesn't like. as things begin to get more unacceptable carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station, and unfortunately it's at that point where she's inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who they've been ride-sharing with, after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip. this is not the greatest flick in the world, but it's not bad...i watched what was supposed to be the 'unrated' version but i wonder how much was cut out of the rated version, because this seemed fairly tame to me, really...not that this makes it family fare or anything, unless it's maybe the manson family. 7 out of 10.
