i was 15 years old when this movie premiered on the television. being raised in texas, i understood the boredom & monotony of teenage life there. this movie touched my impressionable teenage heart & i remembered it fondly through the past 12 years. i recently got to see it for the 2nd, 3rd & 4th times thanks the the love channel. i still cry because the movie reaches in & touches my inner confused teenager.
