the legend of zu, as i saw it, was a very interesting story. i think many of the people who didn't like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film. they were expecting something akin to star wars, and it was not that. joseph campbell, i believe, would have liked this film. there were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked. we all have a mountain of swords within us. we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives. we all have to face our own insomnia someday. granted some of the narration was a bit confusing, and some of the action got a little hokey at times, but i think other points of the film easily made up for it. i'd watch it again. <br /><br />i don't know if there's a difference between the legend of zu (which i saw in mandarin with english subtitles) and zu warriors (the dubbed usa version.) it might have been dumbed down for american audiences, which really would have detracted from this film.
