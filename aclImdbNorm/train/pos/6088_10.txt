was the script more fitting for a 30 minute sitcom? yes, but they still make it work! i thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise bland script, especially jack black and christopher walken. most people on the board seem to really hate this film. i personally can't see how that could be, but envy is just one of those film that you either love it or hate it. much like napoleon dynamite and every leslie neilsen movie ever made. you either think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest. don't avoid this movie because of the reviews. watch it and see if you're one of the ones who really like it! if you do, i guarantee it's worth your money. if you don't like it... well, now you know.
