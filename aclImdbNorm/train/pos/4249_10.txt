whether it's three guys in their tighty-whiteys rapping to a dude bound in twine or a girl saying "what up, dog?" to a lump of roadkill, there's something please everyone in knuckleface jones. it is strange and surreal and not altogether a completely comprehensible yarn... yet it never loses you. the first time i saw it, i nearly laughed myself sick. and every night after i would come home and watch it again. forget coyote ugly... this is the movie that cemented my crush on piper perabo. see it... before it's too late!
