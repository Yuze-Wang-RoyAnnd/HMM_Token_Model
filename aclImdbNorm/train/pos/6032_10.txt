antonioni really showed some 'cojones' when he had this movie made. he went to america working under a contract from the most lavish studio (mgm) and he made the most damning portrait of american society i've ever seen. having seen la first hand this is the most accurate portrayal of the crowded, overheated and impersonal city. if only antonioni had met bill hicks...<br /><br />the subsequent burial by the studio is understandable, after such a whopping investment and dismal return. it is sad that people don't get to see this film any more as i believe antonioni has been proved right. here he predicts the end of the hippie/civil rights movement in the politics of america. everyone is much more interested in what goes into their pockets and the relentless expansion of living space into the inhospitable (yet beautiful) desert and beyond. how i would love to see interest in this film re-kindled and a lavish dvd release.<br /><br />i beseech people to watch zabriskie point with an open mind and an open heart. we have a genuinely unique film commenting on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet, and we have forgotten about it.<br /><br />an unexpected gem.
