along with south pacific, guys and dolls is for grown-ups - - it is sassy, sexy, and full of men being men and women being strung along.<br /><br />there is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack - the strength of jean simmond's performance, and the charm of a young brando, and an already masterful sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the piece.<br /><br />guys and dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is: an mgm musical.<br /><br />still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of 20th century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to come.<br /><br />warmly recommended.
