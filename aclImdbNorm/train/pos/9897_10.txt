okay, sorry, but i loved this movie. i just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies, because you don't see many like this one anymore! i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off, or a cheesy imitation, what is it imitating? i've never seen another movie like this one, well, not horror anyway.<br /><br />basically its about the popular group in school, who like to make everyones lives living hell, so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty. it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks.<br /><br />so, its like 10 years later, and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters. but...they are the only ones receiving them! so they return back to the old school, and one by one get knocked off by.......yeah you probably know what happens!<br /><br />the only part that disappointed me was the very end. it could have been left off, or thought out better.<br /><br />i think you should give it a try, and try not to be to critical!<br /><br />~*~cupidgrl~*~
