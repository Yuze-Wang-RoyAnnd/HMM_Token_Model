personally, i disdain the jerry springer show, however, i found "ringmaster" to be the funniest movie i've seen this year. the never-ending satire of jerry springer "guests" starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie. despite a brief scene in which jerry springer makes a feeble attempt at justifying his existence, i definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value.
