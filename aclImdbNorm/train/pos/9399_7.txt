this is a film i saw when it first came out, and which i have seen a few more times over the years. it's always enjoyable.<br /><br />one thing is that the comedy does not take sides: it skewers labor and capitalists equally. only sid seems outside the classic struggle, even though he's responsible for it. <br /><br />spoiler warning: do not read further if you haven't seen the film <br /><br />this is a fantasy, though presented fairly plausibly. ask yourself: could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric? it would cut through almost any support.<br /><br />also, when cornered in an alley, sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight's shield. cute symbolism.<br /><br />someday, i'll get this on dvd.
