a talking parrot isn't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film, but paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant, heartwarming film that will delight the whole family. it manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel harshness during marie and paulie's separation, and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion. the animal training is well-done - everyone will be affected when paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. paulie is a great character and should have received way more success, though this film wasn't a highlight of 1998, unlike saving private ryan. this hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember. paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy and interesting one - from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner, you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way. not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion. 9/10
