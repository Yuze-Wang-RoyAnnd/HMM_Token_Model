beautiful film, pure cassavetes style. gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness...and alcoholism. she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts, embodied by the death spectre of a young girl. acceptance of oneself, of human condition, though its overall difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling: it's like if the stage became a way out for the heroin. if all american movies could only be that top-quality, dealing with human relations on an adult level, not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings... one of the best dramas ever. 10/10.
