john water's ("pink flamingos"...) "pecker" is the best movie i've seen in a while. it gives the viewer a surreal image of life in baltimore (i live in nearby washington, dc), with a warhol-like use of color, exaggerated motions and emotions. pecker becomes larger than his town can handle, and he is separated from his loved-ones (including a sexy ricci) by his man-loving art manager. the picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth--kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day--and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic, it only made the whole thing more profound and critical. it is a celebration of life, liberty, and the right to bear arms...and everything else this country stands for. -juan pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
