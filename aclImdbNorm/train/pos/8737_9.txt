critically, people say that antz is better. antz is a good film, but i enjoyed bug's life a bit more. i can't remember a pixar animation, other than the two toy story films, that i was laughing so hard. the animation is clean, the story is original and doesn't preach. the voice overs are what make this movie. dave foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful kevin spacey, as is haydn panettiere as dot . there is also sterling support from dennis leary, david hyde pierce and madeline kahn, and i could go on and on. the script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. it lacks the social messages of antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. bethany cox
