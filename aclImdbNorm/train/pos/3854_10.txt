when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of "basic instinct" and some maybe of "showgirls". but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies: "de vierde man". this film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible, which makes the whole experience even more intense. the performances by jeroen krabbe, renee soutendijk and thom hoffman are exceptional, and verhoeven's direction does the rest. "de vierde man" makes even "basic instinct" look quite tame... it can't get much better than this, a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema. 10 out of 10, at least...
