this motion picture has a steady, haunting pace backed up with great acting (one of chamberlain's best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time.<br /><br />beyond that, the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy, cautious and somber tone.<br /><br />weir's story is enhanced by using aboriginals, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous.<br /><br />although they are unrelated in story as well as genre, this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guin's "lathe of heaven" (1980). <br /><br />"the last wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. remember, "hacking and slicing" doesn't make a film a horror movie, it's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all.
