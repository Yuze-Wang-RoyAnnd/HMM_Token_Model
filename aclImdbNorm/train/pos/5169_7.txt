i saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night when i was channel-surfing before going to bed, and really liked what i saw. since then i've been on the lookout, scouring tv listings, flipping through dvd/vhs racks at stores, but didn't find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it. then, being a world-class procrastinator, i still didn't order it. finally, i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting portland, or, a few weeks ago. then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching it.<br /><br />so, what do i think about the film? it's good. not as good as i remembered and hoped for, but still well worth the $9.99 it cost me. after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 7/10, with potential to become an 8/10. i'll have to be less sleepy then, and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue.
