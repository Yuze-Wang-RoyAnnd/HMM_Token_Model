this is my favorite of the three care bears movies. once again i liked all the songs. the big problem however as most people have pointed out was that this story contradicts the original. for those that saw the first movie recall the bears met their "cousins" who they apparently never knew about. it wasn't of course until the end that the cousins received their tummy symbols after proving how much they cared. in this story however the cousins grow up with the care bears and have tummy symbols all along. that being said this isn't a bad movie as long you keep it separate from the first. i thought the darkheart character much more evil then the nicholas of the first. but at the same time i felt it added a sort of balance to the sweetness of the care bears. i also liked the we care part at the end, although i know other people had mixed feelings about that scene. and of course i loved the songs. my favorites being growing up and forever young. the care bears movies have always had such good songs. ten stars for a very good movie.
