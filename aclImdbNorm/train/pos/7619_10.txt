intriguing. exciting. dramatic. explosive. complex. epic. words that only touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the grand story that is lost being told.<br /><br />from the acting down to the rare visual effects, lost is the essential show on television for fans of science-fiction, fantasy, action, adventure, and lots and lots of mystery.<br /><br />each cast member is so well chosen, and so good in their roles, that you either love them, or hate them, or downright wish them dead.<br /><br />the visual effects, when used (which is rare) are actually quite well done considering the usual production of shows. be it the "smoke monster", to the polar bears, lost is believable in terms of eye-candy.<br /><br />as far as story goes, nothing can compare to the vast complexity this show has made viewers like me endure. beginning to end, continuity is virtually perfect, characters are developed, and the ever-evolving story slowly gives the answers to its questions so many crave.<br /><br />overall, there is practically no flaw in lost. it does for dramatic/sci-fi television what arrested development did for comedy: it has set the bar.<br /><br />i highly recommend lost to those that are patient, intellectual, and love every moment of the ride, no matter how long it takes to reach the end.<br /><br />see this show.
