farrah fawcett has spent the better part of her post-angel's career confounding us, with an occasional noteworthy acting performance sandwiched in between her playboy frolics and letterman escapades. but when it comes down to it, there's no denying that this girl can act. far from a story of epic proportions, this well-done tv-movie is gentle, quiet and occasionally moving. fawcett plays the wayward black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her mom's life as well as the funeral, much to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister. brad johnson plays the love interest, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama- but then there's always that confounding farrah to watch, and she does, indeed, remain eminently watchable. (and, yes, i admit it, i did have that farrah poster on my wall way back when). silk hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on the corkymeter. bosley would be proud.
