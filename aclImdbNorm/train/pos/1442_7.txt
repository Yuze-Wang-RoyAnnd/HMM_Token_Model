city hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country, state or any sort of major political table. granted it shines on new york city which is a huge political arena, especially nowadays, but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor's right hand. director harold becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done mercury rising, malice, and domestic disturbance and i think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault. i mean city hall is meant to be a political drama, not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out...what else...or rather who else...al pacino. the film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city. as the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss, and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city. as events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up.<br /><br />i absolutely hate talking about al pacino. i mean even if once he didn't give a good performance how could i ever say it? the man is acting royalty. there is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor. in city hall pacino plays the new york city mayor. he has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician. he also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches i've ever seen at the 'james bone' funeral. i re-watched that speech four times and the first time i watched pacino give it, my mouth gaped open and i almost wanted to stand up and applaud. its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by pacino. john cusack, who i really do enjoy as an actor, turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy mayor kevin calhoun. he is kind of the focus of the film and him and pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance...he seems like he's trying too hard. his accent is just bizarre, and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesn't get seem to pull it off. maybe he was having an off film. bridget fonda, on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows marybeth cogan. her performance is very similar to cusack's in that she just doesn't seem to find her groove with this character. danny aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia frank anselmo. martin landau makes a decent cameo as judge under scrutiny walter stern.<br /><br />the problem with city hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors. everyone is...okay. there is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy. and of course you have al pacino in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film. it almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them. so city hall could have been this huge political epic drama/thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one but it still has to be seen for pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics. if you just won't see this movie than find pacino's speech at james bone funeral because the word electrifying doesn't seem to give it justice but you can see what makes al pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it. if you're a john cusack fan which i am...he's definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice. a decent movie but unfortunately potential loss. 7.5/10
