indian cinema typifies cops of two broad categories: they are either the honest type or the bad guys. the honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end.<br /><br />this movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives. the direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who. the music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter as far as indian cinema goes.<br /><br />the movie is slow at times and the dilemma which anbu faces when it comes to maya is overplayed at times. but i would still give this one 9/10 simply because it has many firsts to its credit.
