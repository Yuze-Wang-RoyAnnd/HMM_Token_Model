i saw the the bourne ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, wow! i had already seen the first two films and i liked them, but ultimatum, i loved.<br /><br />matt damon plays jason bourne, a amnesia suffering cia agent on the run, trying to discover who he is.<br /><br />like i already said, i loved this movie from start to finish, no plot holes, slow scenes, everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films, but in all senses it was much better.<br /><br />best stunts, car chases, actors, and effects i've seen in an action movie all summer, (surprisingly due to spider-man 3, pirates, etc.) but i it wasn't just action in this film, jason doesn't just kill and run. he has a soul and the audience feels for him, so drama is included. but that doesn't slow it down.<br /><br />of all the "threequels" that came out last summer, this was the best.
