though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in austin (sxsw film) just as we were getting tired of things like shakespeare in love, and elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience. an inside look at the staging of "the scottish play" as actors call "macbeth" when producing it to avoid the curse, this is a crisp, efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe. with a wonderfully evocative score, and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but totally satisfying.
