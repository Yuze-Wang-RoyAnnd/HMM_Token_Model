let me say first that this show was top tier when john ritter was there. upon his death, the show did drop off a bit, but the producers didn't give up on the show, adding james garner and david spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005.<br /><br />the show centers around the hennessy family, paul (john ritter, may he rest in peace), his wife cate (katey sagal), their daughters bridget (kaley cuoco), kerry (amy davidson), and their son, rory (martin spanjers). when ritter was on the show, i would shriek in laughter (and proud to admit it, i am), but now that he's gone, i'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh. i'm very glad that i fell for this show's trance after ritter's untimely death, because it made the eps with ritter so much better.<br /><br />ritter's character is just so well acted and well rounded, that you can't help but love him. he is always bossing the girls around about dating, but he really wants them to be happy. it's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment.<br /><br />katey sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character. after ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids, but i believe sagal has shaped the lives of cuoco, davidson, and spanjers, because she and ritter had been friends for a long time.<br /><br />the funniest person on the show would have to be bridget hennessy, played by kaley cuoco. she is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dim-witted, yet she is a smart person. she is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' humor and how conceited she is.<br /><br />amy davidson can get a tad annoying as kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. the only fault of the show is that the show never really gives kerry anything to be happy about. she's always after bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there.<br /><br />martin spanjers as the lone hennessy son is hysterical, and when ritter is on the show, he's mostly comic material. upon the death of ritter, the show does provide some story lines for rory.<br /><br />david spade and james garner are all nothing but laughs, with the occasional side story for c.j., spade's character. garner plays cate's father, as a bit of background information.<br /><br />all in all, i give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it. you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />9/10 --spy
