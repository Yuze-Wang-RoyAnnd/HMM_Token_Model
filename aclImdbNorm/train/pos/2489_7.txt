hugh (ed harris) is a hotshot, bachelor senator determined to run for president. one day, however, he happens upon an old high school classmate named aggie. aggie (diane keaton) is an accomplished and award-winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit. hugh is smitten. he convinces aggie to become his fianc'e. but, will aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics, where things are not always what they seem to be? and, will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz? this is, mostly, a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection. hugh and aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view. however, although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality, it doesn't completely succeed. nevermind. the production values are high and the script is very elegantly written. with these advantages and the handsome personages of keaton and harris, those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment.
