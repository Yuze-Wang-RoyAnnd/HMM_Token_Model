several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters. the shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives. all are transformed at the end of the movie. adela (antonia san juan) leads a brothel; her daughter anita (monica cervera) is retarded and has a restricted life. leire (najwa nimri) is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend; maricarmen (vicky pe~na) has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife. isabel ('angela molina) is a bored rich lady.<br /><br />other characters are used to connect the five main women characters. in storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning: some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience. the shoe-theme is driven to extremes: for example when leire as a shoe-designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints, she breaks one of her heels.<br /><br />in editing small connections are made between the scenes. a telephone rings, a cigarette is lit, a song, etc. are used to make the connection and fast cuts. frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching tv-levels. it is strongly music-driven to set tone and atmosphere. the cities of madrid and lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories, and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters. one of the more moving shots is when anita, who makes the same walk every day, widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road: how the restriction of space is visually translated is well done. as with most spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually, using the soap-like stories as the simple backdrop. there is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful.<br /><br />as ram'on salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong. some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level, including the acting (adela's love life, isabel's doctor). the shoe-theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor.<br /><br />this is often compared to magnolia because the structure is the same. but they are different. magnolia is more technically competent, but somewhat mechanical. this has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually. after seeing this, you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie-city: madrid.
