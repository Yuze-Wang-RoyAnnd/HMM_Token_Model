just kidding about the weight loss thing; well, you might lose weight you never know. anyway, what can i say, i love this film. it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like stand by me and the goonies. jake's closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them. the film reminds us what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic, mystery, and horror they perceive. jake's closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with. watch it with friends; watch it with loved ones; build a fort - wine optional.
