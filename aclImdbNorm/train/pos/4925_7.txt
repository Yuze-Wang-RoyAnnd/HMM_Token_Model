a neat 'race against time' premise - a murdered john doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and nopd battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them. <br /><br />this movie is freely available from the internet archive and it's well worth downloading. a lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in genuine new orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are. there is also a plenty of location background noise, which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene, anyone? there are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is worth hanging on for. there's not much wrong with the lead actors either: jack palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time. <br /><br />somebody should remake this - no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special fx, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme. another reviewer mentioned the writer john kennedy o'toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball new orleans types peppering this dark, sleazy, against-the-clock drama. there's even a midget newspaper seller.<br /><br />"community? what community? d'you think you're living in the middle ages?"
