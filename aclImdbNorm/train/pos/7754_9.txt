any way the wind blows is tom barmans (who is also know as front man of the rock formation 'deus') debut movie. entirely shot in antwerp (belgium), the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters. when the movie ends, you have a lot of stuff to think about, because most of the different story-lines are left wide open.<br /><br />the movie has a (purely instrumental) sound track that will rock your socks off. in most scenes, the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel, really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time. the main scene in the film, the party, is very well shot.<br /><br />the director didn't hesitate to use video clip techniques, having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks i've heard lately.<br /><br />the screenplay is great stuff. camera angles and colors are very well chosen. the 'costumes' are very hot and very 'seventies' too. and i loved (most of the) acting.<br /><br />the thing i liked most about the movie, are the subtle touches of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that interleave.<br /><br />without claiming to be a comedy (this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art), it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times.<br /><br />this is one more directors' debut that shouldn't be an ending. i hope to see more tom barman movies in the future because i had a good time. cheers.
