nice, pleasant, and funny, but not earth-shattering. it does a good job of showing the "behind the scenes" world of theater groups and the lives of the actors. the three witches are great- both on- and off-stage. i would assume the movie works wonderfully (lots of apparent inside jokes) if one was involved in theater (which i'm not).
