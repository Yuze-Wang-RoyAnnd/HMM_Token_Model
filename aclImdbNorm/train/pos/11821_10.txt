the opening credits make for a brilliant, atmospheric piece of escapist entertainment that's full of little nods to the comic strip. all the good guys are good, all the bad guys are bad, and the film is jam-packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make-up to hi-lite their characteristics.<br /><br />warren beatty, as dick tracy, is the ultimate tough guy straight man, incorruptable, calm usually, always a better fighter than the other guy, and rarely one to push the limit on legality. al pacino, as "big boy" caprice steals every scene he's in as a hunch-backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters. maddonna plays the kind of person she'd probably play best, breathless mahoney, a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going. gleanne headly is tracy's tough-talking, fiercely independent long-time girlfrined. and then there's the kid, a funny little street urchin tracy takes in, who models himself after his surrogate father, and saves tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up.<br /><br />the supporting players are a who's who of character actors. charles durning is the chief of police. dick van dyke is the district attorney, who's bribed by big boy's goons to keep him on the streets. dustin hoffman has a humorous turn as mumbles, the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say. r.g. armstrong is pruneface, one of the rival gangsters big boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city. mandy patinkin is 88 keys, the piano player for breathless's show. paul sorvino plays lips manlis, breathless's former benefactor until big boy gives him "the bath." james caan wears relatively little make-up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with big boy's grand plan. william forsythe and ed o'ross are big boy's enforcers, flattop and itchy.<br /><br />this movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip, plus it is full of vibrant colors. almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds. all the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie--and then some! the matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two-dimensional, only acted in three-dimensional sets. the humor is plentiful. al pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he's played before or since. big boy is kind of crazy, and kind of self-pitying. he's an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our founding fathers and likening himself to great political leaders. the man with the plan, always looking for the smartest way to do business.
