i may be biased, i am the author of the novel the hungry bachelors club, self-published in 1994. the screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor, fred dresch, who was the inspiration for the character marlon in the film. i couldn't be more pleased with the trailer, i hope to see the film in its entirety and i will further comment. but jorja fox, who plays delmar youngblood, my character, is stellar. she carries the bulk of the emotional vehicles in fine form. i couldn't have done better myself! this looks like real people, hardly formula driven and thankfully drives my statement against racial prejudice home, gracefully and heartfelt.
