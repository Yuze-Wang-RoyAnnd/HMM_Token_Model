i've seen a great many films, but 'in cold blood' stands alone in a class by itself. it excels in every department. the fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name on the marquee. blake and wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo. the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place, even inside the very house, add additional chills. the black/white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent. there are many outstanding cinematic works out there, but if i could only vote for one to top the list, it would most probably be "in cold blood".
