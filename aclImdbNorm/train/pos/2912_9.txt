we toss around the term "superstar" way too lightly these days, but here's one guy that truly deserves it.<br /><br />i was glued to the set this entire show. the song selection was perfect -- it only contained the songs i actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new songs. i loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment. (with songs of this strength, you don't need a circus to be entertained).<br /><br />the shots of the crowd were amazing, too. how many performers can affect the original beatles fans (now in their 50's and beyond), get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of "can't buy me love" and impact everyone in between? <br /><br />while watching, i also realized that in the wake of john lennon's tragic death, paul mccartney instantly became an afterthought. paul not only lost john and george (no matter what their final relations were, it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment lennon's murder received. i agree that lennon's murder was horrible, but only now did i realize that paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath. i was very happy that he's found love again in heather.<br /><br />as for those complaining about the audio/video quality, i had no complaints whatsoever; both were crystal clear on my set. i think these same people will complain about the quality of dvd when the next format comes out; they'll never be satisfied.<br /><br />my only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when i had the chance. thanks to this video i was able to enjoy it.<br /><br />when people remember john lennon, they will first remember his murder and then his music. i now have a new appreciation for paul mccartney, because, if nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first. and let's hope another lunatic won't change this, because the mccartney catalog is pretty good.
