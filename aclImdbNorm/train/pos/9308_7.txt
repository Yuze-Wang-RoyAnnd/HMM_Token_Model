if you are used to seeing gabriel byrne in serious roles such as tom in millers crossing or keaton in the usual suspects i recommend you take a look at this film. even if you are not a fan of gabriel byrne in particular, all the actors in this film give really great performances. if you've got about eleven bucks (that is close to nine quid) i say order it online, or rent it from you favorite movie rental place. guaranteed to make you laugh, whether or not you normally like gangster type movies. mad dog time/trigger happy is one of those movies you never forget, and find yourself watching over and over. you will talk about it so much your friends will be begging to borrow it.
