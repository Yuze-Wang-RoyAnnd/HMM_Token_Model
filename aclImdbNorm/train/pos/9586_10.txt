the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in. it is well made and very powerful. the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective. i believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society. it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it. some parts were difficult to watch, as most reality is, but it is not over done. its good the first time you watch it, but it becomes even better the second or third time around; because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge.
