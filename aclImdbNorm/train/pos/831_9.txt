i saw this movie while it was under limited release, mainly for the novelty of seeing pierce brosnan with a moustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies i have seen all year. it starts out almost as a thriller, but steadily progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of one-liners and great comedic energy between pierce brosnan and greg kinnear. also, while i say this movie is a comedy, it doesn't forget it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to be. when i went into the theater i didn't know what to expect much more than a moustache, but what i got was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. leaving the theater i felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release. i recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a big moustache.
