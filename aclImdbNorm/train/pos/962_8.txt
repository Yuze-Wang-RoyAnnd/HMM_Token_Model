i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i was so impressed.everything about it was superb. the acting the characters, the story. a believable child who grew into brave, always willing to help others. his mum must be proud. i could not take my eyes off this film for fear of missing something. it is the prefect fable/tale with morals, cute and scary sprites and 'monsters' but nevertheless heartwarming folk. a child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero. picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the goblin mountain where he discovers the yokai, who are amazing creations that brian froud would be proud of. and the evil kato and his off sider who definitely needed a hug. these evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects, like motorbikes and other mechanical things and these meld into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill. takashi a young boy is the one to become their saviour, alongside a red man/dragon a turtle man and a river princess as well as a cute little creature that, if it had been america they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores. the lines are good especially the don't try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips. suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy! though i must admit that the end was a wee bit sad. and not necessarily so. cheers furdion
