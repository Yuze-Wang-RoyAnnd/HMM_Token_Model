gillian holroyd (kim novak) is a witch. secretly, she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor shep henderson (james stewart). she casts a spell on shep that forces him to dump his fianc'e and fall for her. things are going along quite nicely until gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. she decides to tell him her secret. but how will shep react when he finds out that he was "tricked" into falling in love with gillian? <br /><br />as far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, bell book and candle is good, but nothing spectacular. it's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it. just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread. the movie's cute, funny at times, and touching in the end. kim novak and james stewart do their best and have some real chemistry. novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way. the supporting cast with jack lemmon, hermione gingold, and elsa lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from novak and stewart. the biggest problem i see is that bell book and candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. is it a screwball comedy? is it a romantic comedy? is it a supernatural comedy? had director richard quine stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been even better and more memorable.
