i'm glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time. or third. this movie is exactly what it promises to be - lovely, amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends. the plot might be not very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been all used yet. the cast is perfectly selected although scott wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit. so, the sparks are on all the right places, supporting cast is lovably supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel. it is just the right sort of entertainment for a sunday evening.
