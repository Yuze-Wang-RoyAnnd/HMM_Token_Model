i originally scored sarah's show with a nice fat 8, but i've struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin 7 is what's settled in. i shall explain.<br /><br />you will either like sarah's humor, or you won't. if you don't, i doubt anyone could persuade you. you folks know who you are and it's perfectly fine, but then you know that too. moving on, the first season gave us fantastic bits about sarah, her friends and family, and her pursuits in life. in one memorable episode, she is "pulled over" by officer jay whom she meets for the first time. - "do you know why i am standing here?" he asks. "because you got all c's in high school?" she quizzically replies. it seemed to be a genuine question. - that is funny stuff in my book. sarah can come at you from odd angles. in another episode, her affair with god was notably funny. god being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke. it is clever, it is a twisted view, but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed.<br /><br />then, came the second season. while still not without some new and inventive comedy, we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal poop and fart jokes, quite simply. i get some good laughs here and there, but much of it seems like filler while she, and the writers, struggle to foment some original material. sophomoric and tiresome are the feelings i have for the episodes lately, but i have been gutting it out for the gems i do find (the turtle) and waiting for her to turn it around. i was a fan of her "jesus is magic" routine and would like to think that i understand what she is capable of. let's get back to that.
