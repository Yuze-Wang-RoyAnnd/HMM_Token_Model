every country which has a working film industry has some sane (and maybe some insane) artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when you're a part of this country. i guess hundstage is such a movie.<br /><br />you see the lowest level of austria's society, dirty, disturbed, weird, hateful. but they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses. and they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them 'normal' because they're doing it through their whole life. from a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of austria's art movies.<br /><br />but if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in hundstage as the tumor of the society. a society that is going more insane from day to day, creating their own rules that nobody else can understand, cave the social system from within. and you see the people. sitting in the park, standing at the opposite street corner, queuing in the same line. maybe you meet 'em in a bar or a disco you may visit. maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house. you start to hate them without exactly knowing why. you'll try to get away - but you cannot. maybe you'll end up like them. but it seems 'normal' for you because you're doing it through your whole life now...<br /><br />life isn't so bright though austria is one of the richest countries in the world. it has beautiful people... but some are also ugly. there are a lot of hard working persons trying their best... but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of austria has built up so far.<br /><br />a very pessimistic movie.
