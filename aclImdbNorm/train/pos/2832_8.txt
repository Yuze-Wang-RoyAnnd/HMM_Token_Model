i saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the cameo theater on south beach, now the famous crowbar night-club. it was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie really hit home. it's got everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success, and the conflict between following one's family "traditions" to those of seeking ones own way through life.<br /><br />it was a fast paced, highly enjoyable movie. vegas was at it's hippiest peak, sin city in all it's glory. beautiful women, famous cameos, laughs, conflict, romance, and even a happy ending. a very enjoyable time over all. <br /><br />the poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall. i look at it and i go back in time; a time of my youth and my times with my dad, a great time in my life.
