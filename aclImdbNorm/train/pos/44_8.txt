when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick. i was wrong. this movie sends a powerful message about judging others. i was deeply moved. everyone i have encountered, i have recommended this movie to. no one has come back saying it was bad. busy, also did a great job with her role in this film. i don't know much about her acting career but wow, they way she pulled off the end of this fill was great.<br /><br />at the beginning it was a little slow. but after she went to the hospital....wow, the movie picks up again. i have no idea why this movie hasn't been spoken of in the movie world. my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more...because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half.
