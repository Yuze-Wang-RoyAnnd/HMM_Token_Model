randolph scott is heading into albuquerque to take a job with his uncle. however, on the way there, the stage is held up--even though they are not carrying a strongbox. however, a nice lady on board is concealing $10,000 for her and her brother's business...and the robbers seem to know this.<br /><br />once in town, scott goes to this uncle about the job. however, he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk--the typical bad guy from westerns. you know, the rich guy who only wants to become richer by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything. and, it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery. scott demands that the uncle returns the money and then scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother.<br /><br />not surprisingly, this is not the end of the problems---just the beginning. again and again, intrigues of various types occur to try to crush the uncle's opposition. one trick is to bring in a pretty lady to befriend scott and his partners. she's a crack shot and it looks bad for scott--until he figures out why she's come to town.<br /><br />unlike most later randolph scott films, this one shows scott as a bit more headstrong man. all too often in his films he's the last one to suggest violence, but in this film he's quick to suggest a lynching (screw the law, let's have a hangin') and later he's quick to threaten the uncle. what a surprise to see him as such a hot-head--though in most other ways, he's the same old scott you'd expect.<br /><br />as far as the film goes, there's nothing particularly unusual about it. gabby hayes plays the usual character, scott is a hero, the baddie cannot be reasoned with and ultimately is destroyed and scott gets the girl. despite this very typical plot, it's all handled very well and as a result is well worth your time.<br /><br />by the way, there are two weird scenes in the film. first, late in the movie, there is a fist fight between scott and the uncle's #1 henchman, lon chaney, jr.. in it, chaney smokes as he fights--something i never saw before and i did admire how he could puff away as he got his butt kicked. second, get a load of that runaway cart scene with the whip--now that was one impossible feat!
