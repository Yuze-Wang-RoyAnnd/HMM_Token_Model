this movie is obviously low-budget & filmed in british columbia,canada. the obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing(set in california & late 60's-80's)were well conceived.i believe this is the best & most accurate version of the zodiac killings that plagued the town of vallejo & the bay area from 1968-19? (he was never caught).edward james olmos(det. dave toschi) & george dzundza(zodiac-at the time believed to be arthur leigh allen, since cleared by dna & fingerprints)play a game of cat & mouse re-visiting crime scenes together, each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation.olmos dying from some type of terminal disease & knowing dzundza did it,still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family & becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way.dzundza totally oblivious & self absorbed(like all serial killers) to the carnage left in his wake.the only disappointment was the"over the top" ending otherwise pretty accurate.if you tire of the typical hollywood fluff or have an interest in the zodiac case,check it out.
