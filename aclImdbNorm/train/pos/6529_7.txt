i was forced to see this because a) i have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the bonita granville nacy drew movies from the 1930s, which she thoroughly enjoyed. personally, i didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks, but on the other hand, it wasn't the nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff i feared it would be. it was an inoffensive, mildly entertaining movie. although i'm pleased that they didn't try to "upgrade" nancy to 21st century "hipness" (veronica mars holds the title as the modern nancy drew), i do think that they made her a little too bland, that they didn't do enough to develop nancy drew - the movie could have been titled "jane doe, girl detective". i have to blame the script: i think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with. i liked emma roberts in this role, but they gave her a made-for-tv, not theatrical release, script...
