who would've imagined -- hal hartley creates a filmic corollary to syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. the fusion is highly entertaining.<br /><br />having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade, i approached this one with some caution. his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. the director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of long island, new york or in new york city itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br /><br />my initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a "spy thriller". to my pleasant surprise, hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. it works in more ways than one might imagine. hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style.<br /><br />moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as syriana. truly he is coming into his own. the cast does a fine job of interpreting hartley's vision and style. fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before.
