it's always nice to see angela bassett getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into. she is at times intense, funny and even sexy in her role as lena, a "colored" woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of cape town, south africa. danny glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner, boesman. willie jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers boesman and lena's new living area. it's not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes. although it is based on a play, the late director john berry (who also directed claudine) opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen cinemascope format. he also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play. just like diahann carroll in claudine, john berry may have directed angela bassett into an academy award nomination. this is definitely a film worth searching for.
