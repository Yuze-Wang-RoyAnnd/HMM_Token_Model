this was my first introduction to the world of bollywood and i'm now hooked! okay so it requires adoption of a different mindset to watching us films but once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is you won't be disappointed. the songs are superb, melodic and very catchy. the actors are visually compelling especially karisma kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world. locations, colour are spellbinding. if you want something different and are looking to be uplifted, cheered up and stimulated i recommend you catch this movie.
