though this series only ran a season, it has stayed with me for 20 years. it was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever. i would give nearly anything to have it on dvd or whatever format i can get. if you find any means of seeing this series i suggest you take full advantage. this series was the first one (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent storyline that spanned across multiple episodes. it also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them. heck the character goose actually scared me sometimes. he was just that odd at the time. also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of clint eastwood/tommy lee jones. if anyone has any way of contacting the creator/holder of the rights to the series and can get them put out on dvd please by all means do so!!!
