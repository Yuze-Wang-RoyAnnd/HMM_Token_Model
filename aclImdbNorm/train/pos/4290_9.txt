i think charlotte gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. i can't understand why some people say she's not. boring....??? maybe the one who said she's boring is because he/she is boring. she's a great actress and the movie was excellent. it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers. the direction was great. i imaging myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems, etc. when she goes to the sister's shop is simply amazing. everything's great. we have a very good actress, wonderful, for long time. alain chabat and bernadette lafont are perfect. i like him more than in his next movie la science des r^eves. and eric lartigau did a very good work.<br /><br />ana
