only after some contemplation did i decide i liked this movie. and after reading comments from all the other posters here, and thinking about it some more, i decided that i liked it tremendously. i love american films - probably because they are so narrative. they usually have a well-defined beginning, middle, and end. "presque rien," on the other hand, makes no such attempt. i disagree with other posters that say it's 'too artsy.' in every way, this film is meant to evoke your sense memories. so often throughout the film you feel like you're there... you feel the summer sun, the breezes, the heat, the winter chill, the companionship, the loneliness, etc., etc.<br /><br />in every way, the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them. after i finished watching it, i felt the same. but upon some reflection, i recognized that this is how the movie had to be: the 'story' isn't the narrative, it's the emotions you (the viewer) feel.<br /><br />the lighting, scenery, and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they're rich, exquisite, and alive with detail and nuance. although i normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot (after all, isn't a movie 'supposed' to tell a story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.
