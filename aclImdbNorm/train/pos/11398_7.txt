i enjoyed this film. it was lighthearted, delightful, and very colorful. you can see that mgm was showing off technicolor. there are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film. every scene is packed full. the choreography was great. gene kelly is a wonder. he is so talented. the dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed, and perfectly designed. he understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else. the last section of the film, the grand dance sequence, is very impressive. what makes this film very special is gershwin's music. few american composers have had a better gift for melody. i very much enjoy gershwin's music. it is enchanting. ira gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. he is so witty and charming. this was a highly entertaining film.
