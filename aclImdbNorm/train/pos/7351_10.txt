this is one of my favorite govinda movies of all time and best film of 1994. david dhawan does a great job in directing this movie, he makes it funny and adds family drama. govinda is excellent as raja babu and gives a great performance. karishma kapoor is an actress i hate, this film she is a little less annoying but still annoys in some scenes. kader khan is a maestro in acting and yet gives a superb performance. aroona irani is terrific as the mother and gives a outstanding performance. shakti kapoor is brilliant as nandu the sidekick. this film has comedy, action, family drama and romance a full on entertainer.
