an absolutely brilliant show. the second season began where the first ended, with much mystery. suspense in most, if not all episodes and mystery everywhere. one that made me think and think again. it's truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful. never fail to excites and i am looking forward to the new season. hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time, more mystery to be solved. good selection of cast too for this show, fit the characters perfectly. really can't wait to finally discover the secret. hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending.
