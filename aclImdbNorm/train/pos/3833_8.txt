i can't believe others took such a serious view of all this. god, it was a lot of fun rooting for hop-a-long cassidy. it was a great tribute to the western serials of years ago. it wasn't meant to be a great cinema experience, except it was. so what if there wasn't a big special effects bonanza. it was a fun, tongue in cheek, look at old western's. man, relax and enjoy.
