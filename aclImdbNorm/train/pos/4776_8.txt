i was watching this movie at one of my usual time, which is real real late at night. usually if a movie doesn't interest me, i start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake.<br /><br />at first i thought that's what i had to do since this movie's pacing started off slow, along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time. but after a bit, i start getting more into the movie, as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling. by the end, you feel like you've known him your whole life. the movie kept my interest so much that i didn't even know the sun was about to rise.<br /><br />not much of lynch's bizzare style, but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing.
