wow, i can't believe i waited so long to see this film. i just never got around to watching it. the plot has nothing that interests me. i know nothing about soccer (football.) i am one of those american fools that has no clue. i had never even seen david beckham before this film. i chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in america. enough about me. <br /><br />truth be told, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie-making heaven. what a fun film. it's full of color and exuberance. i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie. parminder nagra is so sweet and lovable, you can't help but root for her. no wonder why the american television show e.r. has snatched her up. i have a new appreciation for indian culture. those people know how to have a good time. the wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. <br /><br />the only problem i had was deciphering some of the british slang and dialogue through the accents. i turned on the english subtitles to make sure i didn't miss anything. (this is not a criticism of the film!) i'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in american films as well. <br /><br />this is a perfect date film. it has a great sports plot like rocky, and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women. i watched it with my wife, and sixteen year old niece, and we all loved it. i highly recommend it.
