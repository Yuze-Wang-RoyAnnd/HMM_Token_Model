yet again, early morning television proves an invaluable resource for films that i otherwise would never have been able to track down. at four o'clock in the morning, i stumbled out of bed to begin recording 'the informer (1935),' my fourth film from prolific american director john ford, and an excellent one at that. set during the irish civil war in 1922, the screenplay was adapted by dudley nichols from the novel of the same name by liam o'flaherty. though he was born in the united states, and is most renowned for his "americana" pictures, both of ford's parents were irish, which explains the director's decision to direct the film. victor mclaglen plays gypo nolan, a brutish but well-meaning ruffian who informs on an old friend, frankie mcphillip (wallace ford), in order to claim the lb20 reward for his girlfriend, katie (margot grahame). when frankie is killed during his attempted arrest, the irish republican army, of which both frankie and gypo were members, begins to investigate the traitor behind the incident, every clue bringing them closer and closer to the real culprit.<br /><br />meanwhile, gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend's untimely death, and descends into a bout of heavy-drinking that rivals don birnam in 'the lost weekend (1945)' in its excessiveness. as gypo drowns his sorrows in copious volumes of alcohol, trapped in a vicious little circle of depression, his extravagant spending captures the attention of the investigating ira members. for the one time in his life, gypo finds himself surrounded by admirers (including an amusing j.m. kerrigan), who enthusiastically clap him on the back and christen him "king gypo" for his physical might. however, it's obvious that these people feel no affection for the man, and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money. the additional lb20 brought by frankie's death could never buy gypo an assembly of friends
