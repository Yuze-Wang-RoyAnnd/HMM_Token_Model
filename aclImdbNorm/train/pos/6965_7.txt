this movie answers the question, how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent, clinging, needy, jealous .. and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women?<br /><br />without spoiling the movie, i can safely assure you it does not, but there's great fun to be had along the way. uma thurman is perfect as the mercurial super-heroine, an uber-babe, mysteriously named g-girl, who unlike most in her sisterhood, is not *always* dedicated to truth, justice, and the american way. <br /><br />thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft, yet somehow still fetching, curator jenny. when she is dumped for a less endowed but more emotionally secure and well adjusted rival, g-girl goes ballistic, and what follows is not pretty. it's funny, but it's not pretty ..<br /><br />it's a delightful premise, hell hath no fury like a super-heroine scorned, and those involved don't altogether carry it off, but it has its moments, and i think i'll get the dvd.<br /><br />i liked this movie ..
