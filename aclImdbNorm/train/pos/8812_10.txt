i saw this series when it world premiered at the toronto film festival. i liked the idea behind the film, where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about 911. these directors never met before until the project was complete, and they saw how it looked all together. warning: spoilers ahead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! all the pieces were very powerful, and some were controversial. if you are an american, then you may not like this as some of the pieces may be found anti-american. however, i know a few americans who enjoyed these series. the piece that i found the best was the one from india. it was about how a muslim family, living in the states, had 2 sons, and one of them was missing. the americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing. it captures the mom's despair and humiliation of these accusations so well, that it brought tears to my eyes. in the end we see that her son had died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers. this was a true story, and that was what made it so real. there were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces, and the african piece was one of the best. it was humourous yet just as powerful as the others. a must see for everyone, and hopefully america will unban this, and let it play in their country.
