let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice, i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie. those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears. i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors. the acting was better than average, but the plot held no surprises. they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation. now as to the historical errors, if you call them that, the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april, then capt. pike, jim kirk, etc.. according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (that's the reason a prime directive was created) but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series. i hope the plots will get deeper, and then special effects can take a backseat.
