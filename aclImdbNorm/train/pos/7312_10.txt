it took me time to really appreciate john carpenter's halloween. as a kid, i remember i really enjoyed the sequels, especially the return of michael myers, which i still think is the best halloween sequel. but i thought the first one was slow and took way too much time to get to the point-. i watched it a couple of times recently and i know now i was wrong. today i truly understand this film, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece. it's not about blood and gore. it's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. it's about the worst night in laurie strode's short life. it's about the night his demented brother comes back home to finish what he started 15 years ago. this movie is meant to be scary and i think it succeeds very well. it's also one of the first slasher movies, a horror sub-genre that i always loved. halloween has a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors, such as jamie lee curtis in her first role. need i say more? anyone who's never seen it, horror fan or not, should do his cinematic homework right now. very highly recommended!
