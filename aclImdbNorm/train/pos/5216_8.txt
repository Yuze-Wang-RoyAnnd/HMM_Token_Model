erroll works for the department of public safety and his job is to check up on sex offenders. sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats on the sex offenders. i don't blame him but his boss is ready for him to retire so along comes allison. erroll is now training her to do his job and it's like job shadowing. allison is somewhat naive about the job in the beginning but she doesn't realize how much danger she really is and it's all erroll's fault. he starts to go to far with his obsession of finding a missing girl when his job isn't to be a police officer.<br /><br />it's a fairly decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and works outside his "scope of practice." erroll did do a good job but at the sake of the safety of allison. it has some good mystery to it too and just when i had it figured out, there was more to it.
