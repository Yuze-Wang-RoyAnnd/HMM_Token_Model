i agree with the above comment, i love the realism in this, and in many movies (not just movies on eating disorders) the producers seem to forget that. they take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again, which i dislike because its not reality. not meaning to say things can't get better, and not meaning to say things don't in this movie, but it doesn't spend most of the movie creating all these problems, and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again. when people have eating disorders people don't just admit it and want to get better, and then life is peachy, it takes time, and i like how in this movie we grow with the characters, we go through the difficulties with them, getting better and worse, because it is a very important part of the movie. it gets into the minds of people with eating disorders, and shows the complications and pain, in a very realistic way, and i loved that. i also love how it shows the secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders, it is scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve of it. i thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told, and defiantly one of my favourites.
