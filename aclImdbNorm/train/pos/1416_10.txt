earth is a must see for children and adults. my son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears. we can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth. there are some animals in danger to disappear. exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet. <br /><br />this documentary offers many exceptional pictures that i have never seen before. then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music. the director did a great job here that gets high respect. nothing can stop me and my family to give earth the highest rate. i hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel.
