i have just finished watching this film in my gcse history class. it was thrilling and was a brilliant insight to what actually happened to steve biko during the time of the apartheid law. how anybody can say that this film was the most boring or dull 2 and a half hours of their lives i don't know because it had me hooked from start to finish. it was great how denzel washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting against the apartheid law and to get equal rights for black people. in one part steve biko says to a policeman we are just as weak and human as you are, this is to show them that he and all of the other black people in south africa were no different to the whites. donald woods inspired me because he fort for what he believed in and did not believe totally in apartheid. he and steve biko formed a very strong friendship that shook south africa and went on to awaken the world. i very much enjoyed this film and strongly recommend this to people. it helped me see that racism is not right and that everybody is equal, their fate should not be determined by the colour of somebody's skin. n
