i recently saw i.q. and even though i'm not a romantic comedy type of gal, i think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch. so many movies in my opinion lack honesty. you know that feeling when you're watching a movie and you just feel robbed because it's taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash? the story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one. how they stuck together and they tried to help tim robbins character become smart. i liked the love story between tim and meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love, "nothing is what it seems". i would recommend this for a sunday morning.<br /><br />7/10
