"kalifornia"is a great film that makes us look at ourselves.the film has a great cast,brad pitt(johnny suede,a river runs through it,and the legends of the fall)as early grayce,david duchovny(the x files)as brian kessler,michelle forbes(star trek:the next generation,homicide:life on the street,and escape from l.a.)as carrie loughlin,brian's girlfriend,and juliette lewis(natural born killers,cape fear,and what's eating gilbert grape)as adele corners,early's girlfriend.<br /><br />brian kessler is a writer who is a liberal,is getting ready to write a book about serial killers.brian and his girlfriend,carrie decide they want to move to california,so brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to california,to share expenses on the trip.<br /><br />early grayce is an ex con and sociopath on parole,who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town,is in debt,owes his landlord money.early's parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job.early goes to the college and sees the ad,he later tells adele,his girlfriend about leaving to go to california.early and adele meet brian and carrie at the bus stop and leave town.brian and carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord.for a little while brian and carrie thought of early and adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends,carrie and adele become real good friends.<br /><br />their journey is a very learning one.though brain and carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie.the question brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question.early grayce is a sociopath who doesn't see the error of his ways,goes down hill later on and pays the price.<br /><br />this film is a great movie,i give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up.i love the songs in the movie,especially at the end of the film,the song"look up to the sky"by the indians.
