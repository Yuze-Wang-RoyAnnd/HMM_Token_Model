after you see vertigo, then watch bell, book and candle, made within months of each other.<br /><br />my second favorite kim novak film, with picnic, coming in as third.<br /><br />all three performances are great, vertigo, being the best, of all.<br /><br />they came to my nowhere kansas prairie town, near by, at salina, kansas in the 50s, to film, picnic. <br /><br />bell, book and candle's musical score, i believe is one of alex north's. perfect for this bit of comedy.<br /><br />after vertigo, stewart and novak, did this comedy, how amusing to note the dramatic contrast.<br /><br />worth your time, if you like kim novak. the greta garbo of my youth.
