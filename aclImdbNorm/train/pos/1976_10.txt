the man who directed 'the third man' also directed the 'who will buy' sequence in "oliver!" now that is talent.<br /><br />i raise my hat to carol reed.<br /><br />i know there are 'second units' involved, but still ...<br /><br />and he had to deal with orson welles and oliver reed ...<br /><br />i suppose quality will out.<br /><br />(it does show in the final scene with nancy [ avoiding spoiler - everyone has to see oliver! for the first time sometime ].) how many lines do i need to type.<br /><br />encouraging people to type too much is not to be encouraged.<br /><br />i hope this counts as the "10th line".
