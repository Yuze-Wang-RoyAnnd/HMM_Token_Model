halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. he takes out his problems on his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. this is just the start of things to come from michael myers.<br /><br />donald pleasance plays the doctor who's been studying myers for years. he knows that something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. this evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped.<br /><br />after an escape from an institution, myers tracks down his younger sister. if he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. but he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way. he manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.<br /><br />there have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer. but this one started it all, sort of. if you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have freddy kruger or jason chasing around half naked girls. well, if it wasn't for halloween, those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children.<br /><br />halloween's director, john carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s. this films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of jamie lee curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.<br /><br />this film may seem clich'e today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. it's been copied from and ripped off of, but halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. it still gives you chills listening to carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy michael myers.
