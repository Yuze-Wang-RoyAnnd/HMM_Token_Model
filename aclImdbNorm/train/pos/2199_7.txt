i first came across this film when i read a book (written in the 1970s) about the career of mitchell leisin. i have to admit that over the years i have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality. swing high, swing low was supposed to be one of his best. while it did not bore me, it did not impress me as much as hold back the dawn, death takes a holiday, kitty, or even golden earings. i suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked.<br /><br />working at paramount leisin had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals. most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre. it's true that twice standards appeared in his films, but they were really rare cases: "cocktales for two" appeared in murder at the vanities, and "mona lisa" came out of captain carey, u.s.a. but the rest of the score for murder at the vanities was forgettable. "mona lisa" was the only tune in captain carey. it shouldn't have been this way - leisin's studio had rogers and hart working for it in the early 1930s. why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them? the score for swing high, swing low, is pleasant but forgettable. unfortunately, the movie is centered in the entertainment world, as fred macmurray demonstrates great talents as a trumpet player (he even works carole lombard into his act by looping his arms around her when he blows his trumpet). the song (sung by lombard) about how her lover's playing thrills her, is important to the plot. it works in the film, but it would have been better if the song was more memorable.<br /><br />there is a picaresque style to the film - it begins on an ocean liner that lombard works on, as a manicurist. she is constantly being bullied by her boss franklin pangborn (the ship's barber). then the ship is entering into the panama canal, and we see macmurray as a soldier, who's enlistment is ending shortly. their first scene together has a nice leisin touch in it: macmurray is talking to lombard, she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock. nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit.<br /><br />the film follows the rise and fall of the skid johnson (macmurray) as he meets lombard, and begins his reputation as a trumpet player, but meets the "other woman" in the film, dorothy lamore. the best moments in the film deal with the collapse of the relationship with lombard, and his collapse as a jazz trumpeter (his appearance and need for alcohol is very untypical for a macmurray character - even his darker figures like walter neff or mr. sheldrake or the naval officer who pushes the caine mutiny did not demonstrate a reliance on alcohol.<br /><br />lombard is good as the woman loved but wronged by macmurray. lamore has little to really do - possibly the film had more scenes with her in it, but one stands out is her attempt to get macmurray onto the wagon again. in his opening bit pangborn is fine. rarely noticed in films, small part actor carl judels is effective as a fair weather fan/friend of macmurray, who drops him as he goes under (though he gives him a hand-out).<br /><br />charles butterworth is as trivial in this film as usual, but he does have one moment when he looks sheepishly at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he, his girlfriend, macmurray, and lombard share - his red faced appearance is due to embarrassment about a lie that macmurray is insisting is true. it was a nice, subtle moment. if only his subtlety had been in his acting rather than his moments of diffident humor.
