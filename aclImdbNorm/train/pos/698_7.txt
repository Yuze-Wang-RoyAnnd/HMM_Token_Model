i have seen this movie a while back, after ordering it for my friend, who is a big dominic monaghan fan. the movie itself was very interesting, though it had its positive points, which for me was the donnie darko kind of "wtf?" factor after the movie had ended.<br /><br />of course, with positive also come negative points. to me, the young girl in the film was incredibly good, and dominic monaghan did a good job as well. unfortunately i don't have this opinion about daniel burke, who played lonnie. this might just be me, and i'm not claiming to be a serious critic, in the way that i don't find myself skilled enough, but he just didn't seem convincing as an actor. but perhaps it's even more striking then, for although i am not a critic, this does get my attention.<br /><br />to conclude, over all i think it's definitely a film worth watching. it's interesting, confusing, and you just should have seen it.
