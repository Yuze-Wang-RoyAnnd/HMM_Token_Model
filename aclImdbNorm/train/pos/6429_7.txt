if the movies are to be believed, chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their western counterparts. the storylines of the three 'chinese ghost' films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that it's not a huge problem. as always, humour is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a great deal of mugging. for those who haven't encountered the 'chinese ghoststory' trilogy yet, this film offers an interesting departure from the western horror/ghost genre; for those who have, another enjoyable romp in the chinese ghost world.
