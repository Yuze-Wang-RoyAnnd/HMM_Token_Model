this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in 2004, so i was definitely going to watch the repeat. i really sympathised with the main character of the film, because, this is true, i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (eb). this is a sad, sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. jonny kennedy speaks like a kid (because of wasting vocal muscle) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition, and pealing off his bandages. jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour, he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin. he tells his story with the help of his mother, edna kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and jonny's supporter, nell mcandrew. it won the baftas for best editing and best new director (factual), and it was nominated for best sound (factual) and the flaherty documentary award. it was number 10 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004. a must see documentary!
