i love this show! mr. blick, gordon, and waffle are cats so different from each other, yet they refer to themselves collectively as 'brothers.' i often find myself trying to imitate the tired, sighing accent of their butler, hovis, or even the scottish borough of gordon. there should be more episodes made about human kimberly. the episode about the cats disguising themselves as pre-teen girls to gain admittance to human kimberly's slumber party in order to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink, rootbeer, is a hilarious classic. we can't drink rootbeer in our house now without either doing the catscratch voices or the hanson brothers from the movie 'slap shot.' future classic. where can i get the first two seasons on dvd??
