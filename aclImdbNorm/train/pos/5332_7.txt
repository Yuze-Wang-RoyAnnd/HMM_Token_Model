in light of bad reviews - or car crashes - i feel possessed to get in gear and make a transmission to give merit where due, and do a service. i'm not sure people have license to say it was so bad, almost automatically.<br /><br />it's rare for a movie to have suspense. this movie maintained suspense it's whole length, for me, despite any flaws that may be. how many films can say that? not even many big ones. because of the simple premise you don't know if the people will get out of the life-threatening situation, which lasts the whole movie. yeh, the suspension was tight, and over some bumps the shocks did their work. it's not just a tv movie, but an all-action movie; there is no point where it stops, or deviates, or becomes talky. it would be hard to make a film like this, always on the road. only duel, or speed, are this that i recall. the best thing in them also was the constant tension.<br /><br />acting is not bad: the judge is as good as ever, and the others are. <br /><br />script is good. but the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be - or seem to be - a little awry. what seems unrealistic is not necessarily so. your first judgments are not always right, but i think the lead actor's was right in being in this movie.<br /><br />stunts are mostly terrific, especially for a tv movie. their only failing may be the noticeable, and again, apparent, slow speed. but we all know how deceivingly slow grand prix cars can look.<br /><br />i liked that the beginning said, "inspired by a true story." so you are not going to go how much is true? you know just the basis is. the usual "based on a true story" makes me think it should mostly be true. but maybe that's my error.<br /><br />how to save them: good idea of the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the back wheels up. just a few inches would do. a stunt driver could do that at 100 mph. odd that they didn't call a car expert - or auto electrician or mechanic - to see if there's a way.<br /><br />i hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster. or at least neutral. and help it become a runaway success.<br /><br />pic quality is a little soft for a dvd.<br /><br />spoiler: they would have been winched out after the baby was, but strangely that life-saving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation to fade it out. i guess we know why. end of movie. suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby.
