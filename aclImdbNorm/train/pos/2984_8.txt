david zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts. the film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you'll likely miss them. like his previous efforts which include "airplane!", "top secret!", and "naked gun," the humor flies out almost every second. there are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. what sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. while others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take "mafia!", please), this film tells a new story with likable characters. it touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies. even for people who don't care for "south park," its creators, matt stone and trey parker, make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. the film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes, sports announcers, and other celebrities, especially a hilarious bit with robert stack of "unsolved mysteries." by the way, stay through the credits for a final joke with bob costas and al michaels. all in all, zucker has achieved, in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports, a home dunk.
