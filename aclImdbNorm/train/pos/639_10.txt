this is a good family show with a great cast of actors. it's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late. there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either, unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too. anyway, clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character (pete young) a kind of likability and naivet'e that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly. dean cain, christopher lloyd, mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members, and each is terrific in their role. i really like kirsten storms as pete's sister betsy; she is quite a pill, but she still cares about her mom and brother, even though she hates to show it. it may take a few episodes to really find it's legs, but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while, so check it out people--you'll be glad you did!
