like the characters in this show, i too was a teen during the 70s. the producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist, of being a suburban teenager in the 70s. the 70s fashions, cars, home furnishings, foods, and fads, are all very authentic in this show.<br /><br />the show boasts a very talented ensemble cast, who all mesh together very well on camera. i really like the unique, psychedelic-style film sequences. no other show does camera tricks like this. these cutting-edge film sequences, really help to convey the campy hipness, that characterized the 70s era.<br /><br />overall this is a very funny sitcom. the one thing that bothers me about this show, is it's over-reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughs. in this way, i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children. while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right, it's tacky that the creators of that 70s show, keep trying to imitate it. <br /><br />i do recommend that 70s show, mainly due to it's nostalgia factor. it could be an even better show though, if the writers relied more on witty dialog, rather than bawdy, tasteless jokes and pranks.
