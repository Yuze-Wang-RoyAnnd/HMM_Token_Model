young, handsome, muscular joe buck (jon voight) moves from texas to new york thinking he'll make a living by being a stud. he gets there and finds out quickly that it isn't going to be easy--he goes through one degrading experience after another. at the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled, sleazy ratso rizzo (dustin hoffman). together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to florida. but will they make it?<br /><br />very dark, disturbing yet fascinating movie. director john schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of nyc and its inhabitants. in that way it's dated--the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it's cleaned up considerably by now. he also uses every camera trick in the book--color turning to black & white; trippy dream sequences; flash forwards; flash backs (especially involving a rape); shock cuts; weird sound effects...you name it. it keeps you disoriented and off center--but i couldn't stop watching.<br /><br />there isn't much of a story--it basically centers on the friendship between rizzo and buck. there is an implication that they may have been lovers (the final shot sort of shows that). it's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel, urban jungle.<br /><br />this was originally rated x in 1969--the only reason being that the mpaa didn't think that parents would want their children to see this. nevertheless, it was a big hit with high schoolers (back then x meant no one under 17). it also has been the only x rated film ever to win an academy award as best picture. hoffman and voight were up for acting awards as was (mysteriously) sylvia miles who was in the picture for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes! it was eventually lowered to an r (with no cuts) when it was reissued in 1980.<br /><br />also the excellent song "everybody's talkin'" was introduced in this film--and became a big hit.<br /><br />a great film---but very dark. i'm giving it a 10. don't see it on commercial tv--it's cut to ribbons and incomprehensible.
