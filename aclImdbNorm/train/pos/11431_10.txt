my 3rd-year french classes always enjoyed this film very much. in a multi-cultural, inner-city high school, the film provided many subjects for discussion (in french in class, but i know a lot of discussion went on in english after class). the most obvious is the relationship between prot'ee and aim'ee compared to the one between prot'ee and france.<br /><br />i always mentioned that i felt this film had one of the "sexiest" scenes i had ever seen in a movie. one year, a 17-year-old african-american shouted, "yes!" when he figured out the scene: the one where prot'ee is helping aim'ee lace up her evening dress, all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror. directors use the "mirror technique" when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and it is "sexy".<br /><br />most students had trouble understanding the end of the film. one suggested that one theme of the movie was "africanism", and that no matter how much one loved africa or africans, one cannot "become" african (like the driver tried to do): one must be african.
