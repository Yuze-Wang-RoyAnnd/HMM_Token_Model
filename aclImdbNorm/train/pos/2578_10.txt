superman and the mole men is quite possibly superman's toughest adventures ever.<br /><br />lois lane and clark kent are sent to silsby, home of the world's deepest oil well. while there, some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town. jeff corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men. can superman change the people's ways in time to save the mole men? can superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men bring?<br /><br />in my opinion, superman and the mole men is a very intelligent, well-written and well-acted movie. even though we only get to see superman fly once briefly, it still makes a great superman adventure. a must see for anyone.<br /><br />10/10 stars
