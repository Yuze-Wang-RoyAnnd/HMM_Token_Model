a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy, whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature. his work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field. thus, most of goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. now, one can argue that goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. and at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland (of course, i'm sure those are the same reasons why he's shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial).
