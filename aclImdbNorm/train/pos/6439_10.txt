i went to see this movie twice within a week and can only sum it up in one word (which i normally don't use lightly): wonderful! in my view, the best movie ever made. who deserves oscars and other awards if not this swedish crew who have created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film, when everything that is said (and left unsaid) throughout the story is drawn together? just as the character of daniel dareus evokes so many sentiments and long repressed feelings within the people around him, the movie does the same to its viewers: you walk out with your head abuzz and your heart feeling full. great stuff! next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life", perhaps think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience like as it is in heaven: happy, content, fulfilled. to say it with virginia woolf's mrs dalloway: "such moments are enough".
