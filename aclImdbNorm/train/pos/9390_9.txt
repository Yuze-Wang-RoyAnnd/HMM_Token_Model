this movie started me on a nick cage kick. it is a story full of twists and turns- a movie of motives and moves. of, course, dennis hopper was a ham, but j.t. walsh and laura flyyn boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web. everything about this movie is good - cinematography, story pace and most of all the end. cage excels at what he does best- it's not to be an action hero but to be an everyman caught in the snares of life.
