this is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. when it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. there are literally thousands of scenes i wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.<br /><br />the characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. the famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing "flatop," "pruneface," "lips," "mumbles," etc.<br /><br />meanwhile, warren beatty and gleanne hedley are good as dick tracey and girlfriend tess truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. another good addition is charlie korsmo as the delinquent young boy dick and tess take under their wing. the colorful other characters are played by al pacino, dustin hoffman, william forysthe, paul sorvino, mandy patinkin, madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed.<br /><br />the only negatives i found were pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. those "faults" are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen.
