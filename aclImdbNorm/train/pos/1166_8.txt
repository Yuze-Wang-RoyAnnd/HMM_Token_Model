icy and lethal ace hit-man tony arzenta (a divinely smooth and commanding performance by alain delon) wants to quit the assassination business, but the dangerous mobsters he works for won't let him. after his wife and child are killed, arzenta declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths. director duccio tessari relates the absorbing story at a constant snappy pace, maintains a properly serious and no-nonsense tone throughout, stages the stirring shoot-outs and exciting car chases with considerable rip-snorting brio, and punctuates the narrative with jolting outbursts of explosive bloody violence. delon's suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the already engrossing proceedings. this film further benefits from sterling acting by a bang-up cast, with praiseworthy contributions by richard conte as wise mafia kingpin nick gusto, carla gravini as arzenta's supportive lady friend sandra, marc porel as arzenta's loyal pal domenico maggio, anton diffring as ruthless, calculating capo grunwald, and lino troisi as the venomous gangster rocco cutitta. silvano ippoliti's glossy cinematography boasts several graceful pans. gianni ferrio's funky score hits the get-down groovy spot. erika blanc and rosalba neri pop up briefly in nifty bit parts. better still, there's no filler to speak of and we even get a decent dab of tasty gratuitous female nudity. the startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering wallop right to the gut. a solid and satisfying winner.
