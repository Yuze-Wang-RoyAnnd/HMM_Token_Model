i thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first. it wouldn't have been a big blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money. the movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world. justin timberlake did a good job. i wasn't expecting justin timberlake to do that good a job. considering it is his first movie he did a good job. this is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night. it should go pretty well. the cast was great. so i highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out!
