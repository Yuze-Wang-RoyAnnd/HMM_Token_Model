this is an incredible film. i can't remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered. it's funny, it's tragic, it's compelling, and most of all it's a slice of swedish small town life. it crushes the clich'es, and dwells deeper. it makes you feel connected, not only to the main characters, but to all the characters.<br /><br />big city girl tracing back to her roots, her small hometown, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crossing paths with people she hasn't met in several years. although the story itself isn't unique, it offers a fresh approach. the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters (on different stages in life), who aren't very close. or at least don't realize how close they are.<br /><br />one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast. first, i'm more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so-called 'a-list' swedish actors in this film. usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden. this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession. sofia helin is probably the first swedish actress since eva r"ose to prove that you don't need words to convey an emotion.<br /><br />the writing is also very appealing. the dialogue is more than believable, and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two, it's ahead by miles. maria blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you didn't know, you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film. i can't wait for her next one.<br /><br />once you start watching this, you really want to see it through.
