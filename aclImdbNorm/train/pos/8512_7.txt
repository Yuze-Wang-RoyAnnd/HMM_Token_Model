i can tell you just how bad this movie is. i was in the movie and i haven't seen it yet, but i cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk. especially considering what we did that year. the thing is that they probably over edited it. especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke of the tits of a mexican prostitute (they probably should have followed him around). we made a few come and go appearances but aside from that i can't really remember anything. i was the mc in a few scenes (from what i'm told. what i can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world (or the girl that loser lost his virginity to). overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them.
