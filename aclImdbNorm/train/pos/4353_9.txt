so fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the palm springs international film festival. upon entering the theater we were handed a small opinion card that would be used for our personal rating of the film. looking at the card i turned to my wife and said, "how many movies in your life do you think you can rate as superb? only about 5 for me." but then watching the interaction between peter falk and paul reiser while viewing the spectacular scenery in the film's setting of new york state, i slowly starting bumping the movie up a category at a time. certainly it was good but the totally natural repoire of the actors and an award winning performance by a man who will unfortunately probably be remembered for a raincoat wearing detective rather than this film, the movie jumped to the excellent level.<br /><br />by the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and callous heart melted just like the grinch's and i ended up giving this a superb.<br /><br />this picture is a must for anyone who has parents. no violence or nudity but some strong language.
