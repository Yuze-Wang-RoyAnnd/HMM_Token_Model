george lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't. but this show is a work of art. it's not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it (and jokes that re memorable at that). this show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old, short drunk to an dyslexic teenager. i don't know who writes this show but that person does a great job. if they had just continued the show i'm sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. if you are looking for a good, traditional comedy, then george lopez is the show for you! the one bad thing is the title. george lopez? really? imagine the fresh prince of bel-air being "will smith". c'mon man! but otherwise, this show is genius! 10/10
