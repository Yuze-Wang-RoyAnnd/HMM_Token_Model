i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer,the end result was just two scenes in the movie. the location was sylvan lake in the black hills. bring the wagon,stop the wagon etc . so this dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed. the local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real. (yes doris, animals were hurt during filming) i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining? a great western/social comment from the 50's. this should be in the same class as high noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like blackboard jungle or rebel without a cause was for 50's youth.
