i saw this picture in 1940 for $.11 and i would like to secure a dvd in 2006 the film was the greatest adventure of the time and,like all epics,is still an entertainment marvel (b&w and all)you get a sense of real bonded friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of sam jaffe & eduardo cianelli are outstanding (this could not be done today i particularly liked the ending where the colonel recites the end of kipling's poem over the body of gunga din and tells the "untouchable" "you're a better man than i am gunga din"they don't make movies of this character today.the only cast member that is still alive today is joan fontaine
