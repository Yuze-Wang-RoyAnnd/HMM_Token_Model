this movie had no parts that were hilarious, mostly just average funny units, but it did not have any parts that were really bad either. the worst part was the voice of sid. his slothy slur was just too much for me. by about 5 minutes in i was sick of hearing him talk. aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good. there were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better. this is a good movie for kids. it has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids. this one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.
