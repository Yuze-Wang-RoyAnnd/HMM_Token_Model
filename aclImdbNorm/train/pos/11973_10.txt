full house is a wonderful sitcom that is about a dad, danny tanner, whose wife had just died in a car crash. so danny asks his brother in law, jesse katsopolis, and best friend, joey gladstone, to help raise his three girls, donna jo 'dj' tanner, stephanie tanner, and michelle tanner. this is my favorite show ever, and i can watch it all day long. and something on full house is always making me laugh and there are sad parts also. there is never a dull moment in full house. the main characters are played by, bob saget(danny tanner), john stamos(jesse katsopolis), dave coulier(joey gladstone), candace cameron(dj tanner), jodie sweetin(stephanie tanner), and mary-kate & ashley olsen(michelle tanner).
