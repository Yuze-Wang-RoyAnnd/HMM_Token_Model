beware spoilers. this movie was okay. goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it. okay, so the goofie foreign guy who (spoiler here) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny. this guy's boss was good, too. but the movie really belonged to sarandon and hawn. these two should have had a lot more time on screen together. they're chemistry was great. the bathroom scene-wow! romantic, sweet, yummy.<br /><br />hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians. to talk about sarandon would be to give a lot away. spoilers this is a rather untypical romantic/political comedy, and it satisfies both somewhat-the political side a whole lot more than the romantic. it touches on political issues, and just barely skims on romantic areas.<br /><br />
