scanners ii: the new order is just as good as david cronenberg's classic scanners, scanners was made in 1980 and scanners ii in 1991 so their's an eleven year gap between the two movies. the film captures the style of scanners which is a good thing, it wouldn't be scanners without a head explosion so scanners ii has a head explosion scene that's just has gruesome as the first. scanners ii: the new order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well. the plot to scanners ii: the new order is a new take on the series since it has the scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named david kellum discovers he's being used and decides to get revenge.<br /><br />scanners ii: the new order is a great sequel to david cronenberg's sci-fi classic scanners and should be seen. check this out. 10/10
