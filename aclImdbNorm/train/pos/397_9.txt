i have to admit that tsui hark is one of a kind, you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence. a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience, the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayed.<br /><br />the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983. from this new millenium update, we could see tsui hark's vision of the zu mountains. spectacular visual designs, amazing action-fantasy epic made beautifully well. kept me glued through the entire picture. great cast with just fine acting. it's truly a fun movie to watch, but is it too weird?<br /><br />now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it's broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie. plot may not have much relation among characters, but by rewatching the movie, you'll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself. some can complain there isn't too much physical combat, besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes, spirits fighting by hand-to-hand wouldn't really make sense at all. <br /><br />i appreciated this nice stylish picture. it may have a thin story, but hey look at tsui hark's "time & tide," we got confused by the plot as well, but it was truly something stylish and awesome. tsui hark always attracts something different into h.k. cinema. american audiences, may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie, cause this ain't no crouching tiger, hidden dragon, this is a whole new genre. although it may not be a masterpiece, but it's special effects is truly better than storm riders. this is really worth checking out.
