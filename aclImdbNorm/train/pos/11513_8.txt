one of my favorite shows back in the '70s. as i recall it went to air on friday (or possibly saturday)night on the nine network (?) here in australia. darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together.<br /><br />each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent. to their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible.<br /><br />i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which/who 'came back' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital. the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the 'power beast' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames. oh well .... you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea.<br /><br />mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best.<br /><br />definitely deserves a place in tv's "hall of fame". to quote tony vincenzo .... 'kolchack you are on it '... or, in the case of the hall of fame,'in it' !
