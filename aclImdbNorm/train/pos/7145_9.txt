this movie had a great ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of youthful actors that are going to be in movies for a long while if there is any justice. the directing and editing was great. i may look up the book that this was adapted from, it must have been great. (i liked it.) sigourney weaver, jon voight, and tim blake nelson were a blast to watch! henry winkler and nathan davis were not seen enough, but were fun when they were onscreen. the kids at the camp couldn't have been better. (as i said, i liked it!)
