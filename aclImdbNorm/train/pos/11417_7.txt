this film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they didn't quite come together. i don't know who made it, but it has a slightly disney-esque feel. while parts of it are improbable (like when a pre-teen runs for a public office) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normalcy (whatever that is) to keep things balanced and in perspective. the acting is alright. strangely, the relationship between frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between hazel and frankie is a bit...off. it's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend, her grandmother, and her two passions: ballet and baseball. being a baseball player myself, it was quite painful to watch frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys, but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces. i read somewhere that she isn't really ballerina, but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful. overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but its star mischa barton didn't quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in "lawn dogs", "lost and delirious", and her small but shocking performance opposite haley joel osment in "the 6th sense."
