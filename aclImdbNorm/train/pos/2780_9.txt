great movie -i loved it. great editing and use of the soundtrack. captures the real feeling of indian life, yet we can all relate. a well chose cast with some great characters. the movie develops all the characters so that you real care about them all and you feel like you know them. the use of the indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural. you just can't help but to root for jess in this film! the acting was really good, even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very convincing as a someone that played lots of soccer.
