although this film is somewhat sanitized (because it was made at a time when people just didn't talk about sex), it is an extremely helpful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. not surprisingly, it was paid for by the kotex company, though what may surprise many is that disney made this film--as they made a lot of educational films during the 1940s-60s. however well made the film is, though, i think the film maker's missed a real opportunity. instead of the nice female narrator's voice and the relatively bland visuals it would have been great if they'd used minnie mouse and the rest of the disney gang!! i know this would have given old walt a heart attack, but wow that would have been a great film! by the way, although the notion of sex is barely hinted at in the film, it does adequately explain menstruation in general. however, it does lack some details (especially about intercourse) that i assume were included in the accompanying booklet.<br /><br />now if only i can figure out why i watched a cartoon about menstruation.
