a pentagon science team seem to have perfected a serum which causes invisibility but when the lead boffin tries it out on himself he can't reverse the process. frustrated and drunk with power, he turns psychotic in the classic h.g. wells tradition.<br /><br />this is a gleefully horrible invisible man story, delivered with relish by the ever-tasteful verhoeven and bacon as the genius-turned-loonytoon-maniac. as with much of verhoeven's work it has a terrific unrestrained sense of boy's-own comic-book adventure (the secret underground lab where the scientists work is just wonderful) combined with the most horrific and depraved visuals (women in their underwear being groped and attacked by an invisible fiend, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two reels). whilst the story doesn't ring any new twists on an old idea, the cg special effects by scott e. anderson are eye-poppingly brilliant as we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones and flesh all literally appear out of nowhere. in particular, a sequence where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where bacon drowns devane in a swimming pool, are absolutely breathtaking in the detail and artistic invention of the effects. the film also has a great soundtrack by jerry goldsmith and classic horror-movie photography by jost vacano. the young cast are pretty much overshadowed by the movie's technical pedigree, but both shue and dickens are impressively out of their depth. this is a great fun nasty movie.
