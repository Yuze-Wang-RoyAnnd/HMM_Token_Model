i was privileged to have seen some snippets from aardman's original run of this show in the uk. it was always fun and always funny. none of the charm has been lost in translation--it's as fresh as the people interviewed--whether some of it is scripted or not, as has been rumored, is beside the point. it's always entertaining.<br /><br />aardman animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the single aspect that i probably love most about the show and its concept (the hostility between the pandas, the porcupines discussing fear of needles, the painting ape). regulars really grow on you as well, such as the horse and donkey teens from maryland, most every married couple (the parrots, the insects, and the cats to name a few) and child-voiced character, and i've really come to dig the ferret! monday's finally become a day to which to look forward.
