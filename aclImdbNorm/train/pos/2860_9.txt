it ran from 1959-1973. its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's , psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's.<br /><br />i remember repeats of this series. it was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. lorne green had his defining iconic character from this series. its appeal was across generations. all members of the family could enjoy this. it balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. a cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. the shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.
