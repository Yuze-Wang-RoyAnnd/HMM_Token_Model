i watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to billy elliott (2000). both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. in both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />the major difference that i found between the films was that october sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. laura dern puts in a moving performance and chris cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in american beauty (1999). joe johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as jumanji (1995) and jurassic park iii (2001).<br /><br />
