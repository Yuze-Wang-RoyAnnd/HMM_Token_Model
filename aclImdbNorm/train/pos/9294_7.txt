before i start, i should point out that i know the editor of this film. we've never met, but we belong to the same fanzine(those things which came before message boards), and we have talked on the phone, so i do have a bias here. anyway...<br /><br />somehow, it's ironic how while the "rat pack" culture of the late 50's and early to mid-60's made a comeback in the mid-90's, this movie, from the son of one of the original rat pack, and which was made in a similar fashion, was a flop. not only that, it was a critical flop; i believe peter travers of rolling stone was the only one who did not savage this(he gave it a mixed review, as i recall). and while i don't think this is the greatest film in the world, and i am not a fan of the rat pack, or "cocktail," culture, i do think this is worth seeing.<br /><br />for one thing, this looks stylish, and moves right along. for another, the core performances are all good. richard dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a sanitarium, and has a droll edge to him. jeff goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his pre-blockbuster days, like the big chill. and while ellen barkin is only required to vamp in this movie, she does it entertainingly. admittedly, it's not a great film; the dialogue is mostly made up of puns, and a lot of them don't work(like the whole "zen of ben" speech). and gabriel byrne and kyle maclachlan are awful here. still, i was entertained, and if you like gangster films, you might be too.
