it's amazing that actress p.j. soles didn't become a big star after playing riff randall, #1 fan of the punk rock group the ramones, in "rock 'n' roll high school". soles is so exuberant, you don't mind she's obviously too old to still be in high school (that fact is leveled out by having all the kids look 24). the movie is a fast-paced frolic that doesn't cop-out; everything gets blown to smithereens at the end, and that's just as it should be. mary woronov, an innately kinky and funny presence as the nazi-like principal, gets a great, one-of-a-kind bit at the beginning where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many takes did they use on that, or was it a fluke?) and dey young is very appealing as soles' best, kate rambeau. the weakest link, ironically enough, in this "high school" chain-gang is the ramones. they can't act, they're not funny, and their concert segment goes on too long. one ramones song, "i want you around", is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good, particularly a rare paul mccartney ballad heard near the beginning ("did we meet somewhere before?"). great fun! *** from ****
