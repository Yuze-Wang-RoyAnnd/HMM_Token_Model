young erendira and her tyrranical grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world. this interpretation of gabriel garcia marquez'"la incr'eible y triste historia da la c'andida er'endira,..." may not rub marquez purists the right way eventhough the story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work. the strength of this film is in its acting especially papas as the grandmother. marquez fans and marquez novices alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of witt.
