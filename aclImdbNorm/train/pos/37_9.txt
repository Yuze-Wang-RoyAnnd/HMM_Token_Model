of the elements that make this the best at this point, i have to say #1 is christine mcintire. shemp's scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent. i imagine that, as one poster suggested, christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene, but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil, to be smiling at shemp's possibly dying.<br /><br />another character who helps this stand out is the goon. his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball. hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or, for that matter anywhere. i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this, but hey, when a short is this good, who's going to complain. not i.
