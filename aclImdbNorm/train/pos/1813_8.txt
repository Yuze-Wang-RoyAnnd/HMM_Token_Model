in my case i liked this movie because when i saw it i found more than i expected. i mean, this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about its themes even long after i finished. it talks about death, vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets to you like a punch in your face, even reaching to suffer with the dream sequence in the mid-point of the film. that's what makes this movie so good: the ability, unique in don bluth (director), to play with the people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time. that, and the fact that it has so many good characters like charlie and ann-marie, that in the sad but happy ending you have to say "i have something in my eye" to hide the others that you cried. all i've said are just only some of the good points of this movie. as for the rest, you have to see them for yourself in a film extremely honest. don bluth, thank you.
