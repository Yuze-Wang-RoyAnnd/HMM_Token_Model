kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama. the curious character development is indicative of a nuanced and well schooled writing team. the audience member cannot but help but to feel that (s)he must make wrenching emotional decisions pitting the cerebral against the libidinal. the viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself, though her predictions are rarely validated.<br /><br />credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting. the wood-shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds, with its own traits, faults, a variety of highly charged relationships, and of course a fate inexorably tied to that of the other principals.<br /><br />make sure to catch this one at your local art-house.
