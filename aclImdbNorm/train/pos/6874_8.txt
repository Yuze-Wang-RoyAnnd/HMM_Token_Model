a series of vignettes, most of them spoofing television of the 1970's, but also with some digs at the government and corporate america. one of the longest segments, "the dealers" is not that funny to me and i don't know what it is parodying. some of the others, though, are absolutely side-splitting. i particularly enjoy the cooking show segment. most of the foul words i know are used in the movie, and, if you object to full frontal nudity, stay away.
