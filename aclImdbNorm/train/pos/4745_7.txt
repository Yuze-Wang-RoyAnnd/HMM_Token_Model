i can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the american audience to the dynamo that is jet li. fist of legend would have been a much better choice. anyway, black mask isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great either. the final fight sequence is well staged by yuen woo ping who went on to coordinate the matrix. but the english release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (i'm begging the hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.)jet li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and francoise yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701.<br /><br />black mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions. more focus on li's fantastic physical skills were in order. black mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up fist of legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows li's skills.
