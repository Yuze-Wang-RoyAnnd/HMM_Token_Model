four stories written by robert bloch about various people who live in a beautiful, old mansion and what happens to them. the first has denholm elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he's writing about come to life. some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good. the second has peter cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife. the third has christopher lee who has a child (chloe franks) and is scared of her. it all leads up to a pretty scary ending (although the ending in the story was much worse). the last is an out and out comedy with jon petwee and ingrid pitt (both chewing the scenery) and a cape that turns people into vampires! there's also a cute line about christopher lee playing dracula.<br /><br />this is a good horror anthology--nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills. also the fourth one is actually very funny and pitt makes a very sexy vampire! also the house itself looks beautiful...and very creepy. it's well-directed with some nice atmospheric touches. a very good and unusual movie score too. all in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out. try to see it on dvd--the lions gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.
