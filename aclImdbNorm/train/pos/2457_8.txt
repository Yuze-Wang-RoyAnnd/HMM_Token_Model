when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood, go watch this film. it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting, and it is very encouraging, in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective.<br /><br />when you know both the turkish language and either the danish or the german language, go watch the film in any case. half of the dialog is danish in the original, synchronized to german in the translated version, the other half turkish, subtitled in danish or german, respectively. when i watched it in mannheim, germany, the reaction of the turkish-speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog, which, deplorably, mostly escaped me, being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles. still, the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the turkish.<br /><br />esthetically, the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness. on first sight, there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning, making it a quick, an agitated film. in particular, even though this is a kung fu movie, watch out for the running scenes, beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions. but there are quite a few very slow, emotionally intense scenes, too. and above all, the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age; still, there is some movement in the characters to: closely watch the villain omar, whose part and acting i liked very much.<br /><br />the contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity - shown at once, in the same characters, at the same time.
