the ultimate homage to a great film actress.the film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen.like great poetry it is timeless.direction,cast,screenplay,music,lyrics,in fact all the norms for movie-making are perfectly chosen to suit the message of the film.the muslim society in india has never been presented with such respect,nobility and reality.the script is memorable in the hands of meena,ashok,raaj kumar,nadira etc to name a few.personally i was most impressed by the regal looking kamal kapoor.the master movie maker kamal amrohi's lasting legacy to the sub-continent.a very beautiful film on a controversial theme that makes humanity look up and face the reality of the outcasts in the world.'in ka naam? pakeeza! haan pakeza'.such acting is unheard of in this age of sex,dance and pornography.
