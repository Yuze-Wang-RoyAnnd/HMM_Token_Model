i couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when i read about fred astaire teaming up with george burns & gracie allen in a movie with a script by p.g. wodehouse and music by the gershwins. it is definitely worth seeing, but lacks the cohesive quality of the fred & ginger movies.<br /><br />the story would probably be better to read in a wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />but...! the funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. i never knew that gracie allen could dance, but boy does she in this movie. have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! she keeps up wonderfully with astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture.<br /><br />several nice songs, particularly fun are nice work if you can get it and stiff upper lip.<br /><br />recommended for fans of astaire, burns & allen. i had to go back and re-watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.
