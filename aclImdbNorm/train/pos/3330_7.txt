i was not only an extra in this movie, i got to see it in boston to a sold out cinema. over a thousand boston red sox / farrelly fans jammed themselves into a movie theater near boston common to watch a comedy....about them....red sox fanatics! drew barrymore and jimmy fallon star is this cute comedy about love and lust. the love is between the two young lovers. the lust is for the red sox winning the world series. although fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. he is funny enough and gets the most laughs. barrymore on the other hand is the same old barrymore. at times, i felt supporting actress ione skye would have been a better actor for the role. all in all, all boston red sox fans will love this movie. for the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
