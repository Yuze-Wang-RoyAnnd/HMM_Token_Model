i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen. robert harling's script is near perfect, just check out the "quotes" section; on second thought, just rent the dvd, since it's the delivery that really makes the lines sing.<br /><br />sally field gives a comic, over-the-top performance like you've never seen from her anywhere else, and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious. robert downey, jr. is typically brilliant, and in a very small role, kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer. i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue, but she's great here as the one *real* person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of "the sun also sets" -- that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave. either that, or he's laughing really hard.<br /><br />five stars. funny, funny, funny.
