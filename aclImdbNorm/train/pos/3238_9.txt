the finnish version of robert altman's "short cuts", set in the small rural town of "a"anekoski. the episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. i was particularly impressed by two episodes. the first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to stir up a romance for his co-workers: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. the other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the "routines" of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional empathy). compared with altman's classic, this movie is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great piece of art.
