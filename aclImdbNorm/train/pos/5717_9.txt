omigosh, this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever, ever seen. to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement, and i have seen heaps (considering the limited availability in new zealand, that's quite a lot), but never before have i had to sleep with the light on...until i saw the grudge.<br /><br />some may say that it is a rip off of the ring (both based on japanese horror movies), both similar (yet different) story lines, but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema, i even screamed at a certain point in the movie.<br /><br />the acting is great, particularly from the supporting characters - kadee strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. jason behr is a real hottie, and william mapother looks like he is having fun. however, while i am normally a fan of clea duvall's, she doesn't really seem into this movie. of the supporting characters, hers probably got the most depth and back story, but she doesn't seem like she is all there. as for sarah michelle gellar, well, she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesn't she? the ghosts were genuinely scary, the music and sound effects were chilling (particularly the noise being made when kadee strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment), the ending was cool too.<br /><br />super highly recommended. 9/10
