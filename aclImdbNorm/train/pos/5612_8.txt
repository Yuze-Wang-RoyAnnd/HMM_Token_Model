in paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat trelkovsky (roman polanski) rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant, the egyptologist simone choule (dominique poulange), committed suicide. the unfriendly concierge (shelley winters) and the tough landlord mr. zy (melvyn douglas) establish stringent rules of behavior and trekovsky feels ridden by his neighbors. meanwhile he visits simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend stella (isabelle adjani). after the death of simone, trekovsky feels obsessed for her and believes his landlord and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide. <br /><br />the weird "le locataire" is a disturbing and creepy tale of paranoia and delusion. the story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the lonely trelkovsky are slowly developed in a nightmarish atmosphere in the gruesome location of his apartment, and what is happening indeed is totally unpredictable. the performances are awesome and isabelle adjani is extremely beautiful. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): "o inquilino" ("the tenant")
