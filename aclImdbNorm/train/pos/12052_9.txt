i saw this on tv so long ago that i can't remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the scariest, most unnerving films i've ever seen. there is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame, not quite clearly visible, so that you feel (like the solicitor hero), unsure whether its just imagination or not. it is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching. "production values" be hanged, good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film, actors, locations/sets, music, attention to detail, and ...imagination. a real gem.
