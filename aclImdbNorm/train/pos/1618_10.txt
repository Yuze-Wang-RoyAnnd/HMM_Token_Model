this movie is brilliant in every way. it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. the script never condescends toward any character, not even the hapless johnny. it also and benefits from spot-on direction, production design, casting, and performances. the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike "cher" than she has ever been is a wonder to me. i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well. it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end.
