this movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. i may be bias, as the apartheid era is an area i've always felt for. but i'd say it ranks right up with cry freedom and cry the beloved country. sadly up until a few days ago i'd never even heard of this movie. inside is one of the most underrated films of all time, probably because it was a small film company, i'd never even heard of it before. eric stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is believable and dramatic, nigel hawthorne plays his dastardly role well. do not look for humor in this film, there is none. it is real, savage and gritty to the last, and to the sensitive i'd say bring a box of tissues. but movies as great as this make you wonder, why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of?
