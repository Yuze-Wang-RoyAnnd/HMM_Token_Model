youth, sexuality, and the french countryside -- one of the more unique films you're ever going to see. if you can see it that is, no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) it's sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting, and occasionally funny. a trifle boring also in the middle, but all in all you can't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until you've seen this one at least once.
