the movie held my interest, mainly because dianne keaton is my favorite actress. i disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted. i had no trouble following it (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). the movie was very sad and touching as well. what more do you want? alexa davalos is a fine new talent (beautiful too), and tom everett scott does an excellent job with his part as well. the relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not. it was tragically sad but enlightening. it sure beat the other shows that were on tv new years day evening
