i only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. it now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films. it is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. it has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. i fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. it is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric beales, a true aristocratic family. it has a tangible atmosphere and i found myself wishing i could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. it has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. a fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. the money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. it drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished i found myself wondering about their fate. wondering that if i took a walk along east hampton beach i might still hear old edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of little edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. unforgettable.
