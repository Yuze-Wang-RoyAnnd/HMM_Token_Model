keeping all political views aside, feroz khan and anil kapoor's 'gandhi, my father' is a good movie that cleverly explores the confused-towards-family side of mohandas karamchand gandhi, and the fight of his eldest son harilal gandhi with the society, his larger-than-life father, and most importantly demons in his head. one draws parallels to gandhi the father of the nation and struggles any son could have with their father<br /><br />the acting is good. shefali shetty, darshan zariwala and akshaye khanna-strictly in that order- add color and pathos to this heart wrenching tale of harilal who weeps to be hugged just once and also runs away at the faintest touch of the finger.<br /><br />feroz khan's direction and the production canvas is lavish and attractive, however, the screenplay could've been tighter. i had seen the play some years ago on a pirated video type dvd (it was called mahatama vs gandhi, i think) and it was certainly more gripping. though, the movie's background score and the father-son and mother-son moments are just a brilliant treat.<br /><br />this movie could have been great. it's borderline to that. it has the potential so huge to have been just a story differences between a father and son or just gandhi or even both. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions, nothing comes to you.<br /><br />it compares decently to other gandhi's. certainly not an overview film like kingsley's gandhi,or abstract as kamal hassan's hey ram. the film just about manages to find its footing; however, one is left wondering "what if..." worth a watch. 7.5/10
