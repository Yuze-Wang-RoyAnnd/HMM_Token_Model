pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond, is an assassin. he is very very good at what he does, but he's getting old and tired. greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man. now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives. then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they begin to talk. then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. the story is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny, but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see.
