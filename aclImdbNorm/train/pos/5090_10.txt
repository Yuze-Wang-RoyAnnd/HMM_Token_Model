i loved this movie. great storyline and actors and good movie sets. it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep. i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack. i can not find it anywhere. please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack. other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating. swayze did a great job. i think this is some of his best work. his past movies were ok, but this one really told a story for a change. this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired. congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work.
