"kaabee" depicts the hardship of a woman in pre and during wwii, raising her kids alone after her husband imprisoned for "thought crime". this movie was directed by yamada youji, and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful. although the historical correctness of some scenes, most notably the beach scene, is a suspect.<br /><br />the acting in this movie is absolutely incredible. i am baffled at how they managed to gather this all-star cast for a 2008 film. yoshinaga sayuri, possibly the most decorated still-active actress in japan, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. shoufukutei tsurube in a supporting role was really nice as well. it was asano tadanobu though, who delivered the most impressive performance, perfectly portraying the wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was in.<br /><br />films with pre-war setting is not my thing, but thanks to wonderful directing and acting, i was totally absorbed by the story. also, it wasn't a far-left nonsense like "yuunagi no machi, sakura no kuni", and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in japan. excellent film, highly recommended for all viewers.
