it's a difficult movie to classify "10 items or less". generally, i don't care about defining genres, but there's something about this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category, in order to transmit, even with only one word, your feelings about it. i completely recommend this film to anyone and, if you truly enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life, you'll want to do the same as soon as you've finished watching it. <br /><br />i recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it's not perfect but it doesn't do anything wrong. i don't want to sound like i contradict myself, but i believe writer/director brad silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script. i'm sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection: a product that would be as simple, appealing and uncompromising as its title. well, he's done it. <br /><br />silberling, director of long, complex, dramatic movies like "city of angels" and "moonlight mile", proves with "10 items or less", which closes in at just 70 minutes, the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it. to put an actor (morgan freeman) in front of a woman (paz vega) in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places ordinary life would take them is what silberling proposes here. <br /><br />i can't tell you no more because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought provoking background that shouldn't be underestimated. because here everyone's exposed: the camera focuses directly on the two main characters, who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops that's not endless only because life is life. and let me express how praise how well silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches, in less time (not only in movie duration time, but in the single day that the movie develops its events) and in a smaller place, the kind of connection between two characters that sofia coppola generated in "lost in translation".<br /><br />that movie, set in tokyo, also encountered an actor and a woman, and they also had conversations about the moments they were living in their lives. it's in the conversations where we sense the though provoking quality of "10 items or less" and, just as in coppola's movie, the naturalness of every situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words don't seem forced or included in the picture to 'buy time'. <br /><br />in this aspect, the collaboration of silberling and his director of photography phedon papamichael. the man who shot the beautiful sceneries in "sideways" and focused on every emotion in "patch adams", delights us here with visual passages of true natural beauty. <br /><br />but the ultimate beauty of "10 items or less" can be found in its cast (by avy kaufman), in its two protagonists. they are the ones who transmit this feeling i mentioned at the beginning and i can't specify; we feel their connection and we can tell they're having fun and that they may even be improvising stuff. academy award winner morgan freeman, also an executive producer of the film, simply stands there and confirms the status he has today in the movie industry, and one that's well deserved: a quiet man, filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry as he can make you laugh. and the beautiful paz vega (well, i said she was great in "spanglish")
