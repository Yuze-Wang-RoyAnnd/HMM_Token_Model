after reading only two of the comments herein, as a lifelong bronte fan, beginning with olivier's heathcliff and enduring with the many versions of charlotte's "rochester," it is more than eye-opening to see that it is the unsung bronte sister who gave the lie to the male-chauvinist period the trio inhabited. of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of 19th-century british domesticity is that the "girls" were all "spinsters" and their only realistic brushes with "men" were their vicar father and their wastrel? brother. that said, finally, it is anne bronte who has, in her single assay?, proved the "feminist" point, way way ahead of contemporary types, and including the "voting franchise" ranks. however, history evinces more than a few who preceded, including the greek heterai and sappho and the likes of an ancient emperor's yang kuei-fei. and how about "eve" and her apple?
