with lots of sunshine, gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms, tracking shots moving through crowds with hand-held camera, quick-paced editing and extreme close-ups here and there, the photography is the thing in this interesting, artistically done film.<br /><br />the plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest. the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet the lovely lucienne aka lulu (played by louise brooks) - a bit of a show-off in front of the gawking men by poolside, she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest, much to the chagrin of her very jealous, stick-in-the-mud fianc'e (a pretty annoying fellow, really). strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits, while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause (i was wondering, couldn't the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time - and thus applause - on the catwalk?!). lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a maharaja, but her hot-headed beau doesn't like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public, for that matter (i guess he just wants her in his house, cooking his meals, and staying out of sight, eh?!).<br /><br />louise brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps enhance this film, but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most. a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound, which is a bit off. the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though. watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually, and i found the movie to be excellent, well worth seeing.
