it's just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project. so refreshing and educating. not only to a filmmaker, who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time, but also as audience, who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time.<br /><br />20 short films about love in paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. i thought the tom tykwer (natalie portman) segment was the best, although the mimes made me smile inside just the same.<br /><br />i clicked on "spoilers" option for this review bus alas...what you read is a spoiler enough. just watch it. don't read what i write, but watch the movie instead.<br /><br />and smile.
