saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene. a delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars. only wish i could find it again! would certainly buy/view it if i could. please, somebody, bring it back. fred macmurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during world war ii, and his leading ladies, joan leslie, and especially june haver were beautiful and charming. it was a musical, but also romantic, funny, and clever. this was my favorite movie starring june haver, although i always liked her. her dazzling smile lit up the screen, and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film. the supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles. a well-balanced and light-hearted film; only wish we had more like it!
