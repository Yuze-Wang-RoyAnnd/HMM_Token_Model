deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing, a feat that is beautiful to behold. when cher's spineless fianc'e asks her to help him make peace with his estranged, moody younger brother, no one could dream the consequences which follow. operatic symbolism, catholic church confessions, love bites and falling snow..."moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. it takes about 15 minutes for the picture's rhythm to kick in (there's an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that's a little rough, and a following scene with cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse), but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill, and the movie's wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious. ***1/2 from ****
