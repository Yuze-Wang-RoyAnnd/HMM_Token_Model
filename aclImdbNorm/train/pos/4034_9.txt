pinjar is a genuinely good film, with great acting, good narrative, good presentation, touching emotions, etc.<br /><br />it seems to me that the quality of films that bollywood is producing is quite improving these days, and this film is one evidence.<br /><br />no bollywood movie that i can remember of made such an impact on me - i was literally thinking about the movie for hours - marvelling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human.<br /><br />the film rests on the great acting of urmilla matondkar, and also some from manoj bajpai. urmilla plays a girl in north india in the background of the partition, and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face. <br /><br />a must-see film. a technically superior bollywood product, which i feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world.
