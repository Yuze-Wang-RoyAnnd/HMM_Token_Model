as the story in my family goes, my dad, milton raskin, played the piano for the dorsey band. after sinatra joined the band, my dad practiced with him for hours on end. then, at a point in time, my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group (band), and that he should venture off on his own. by that time sinatra had enough credits 'under his belt' to do just that! dorsey never forgave my dad, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />i have some pictures and records to that effect, and so does berkley university in california.<br /><br />i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say, and his movies never get old . . . thank you frank
