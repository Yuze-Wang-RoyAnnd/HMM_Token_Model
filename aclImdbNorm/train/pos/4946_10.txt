bravo! morgan freeman is an actor, who researches a character he is selected to play, before he makes a commitment. freeman is a 'good fit' for this film (like he was for "driving miss daisy"), and he is not only believable, but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and propriety. although there are no guarantees in life, for anyone, this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out, in order to avoid getting stereotyping. and it must be said that stereotyping has hampered, or completely ruined, a significant number of acting careers.<br /><br />this is a low-budget film that, amazingly, was made in a time span of only two weeks. it is a film that is well directed and written by brad silberling. the location manager chose carson, ca for the film's setting, and the location helps set the tone and timing for the film. the editing is fair to good, but a little rough.<br /><br />silberling was the 'subcontractor', in getting freeman to do this film, while the actor was in-between film projects.<br /><br />there is a good chemistry between freeman and paz vega, a spanish actress, and this opens an effective dialog between each of the cast members, who are diverse and come from different cultures. the film also encourages an understanding between people, who not only speak two languages (english and spanish), but come from two different worlds of ethnicity, race, gender, norms, mores, beliefs, folkways, principles, and values. the film strives for some honesty, and arrives at some truth, to maintain the film's integrity.<br /><br />part of the comedy is that freeman plays an unemployed actor that has been out of work for four years. in truth, freeman is so-in-demand as an actor that he is constantly working.<br /><br />the film offers an adventure of bonding, caring, sharing, changing, and exchanging. and, the film's outtakes give the viewer a preview of some of things an actor must go through in preparing for a role.<br /><br />if necessary, tell your boss that you're taking a 'mental health day', and go see this film. if you're able, take your significant other or your family with you. i rank the film a 10 out of 10. it's enjoyable, interesting, informative, poignant, and worthwhile.
