i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day! we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. wasn't necessary. the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name, the fact that there is a bet, and a whole lot of worm eating. oh yeah, i almost forgot, the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent. how the kids know each other, the number of kids involved, how the bet came about, the number of worms that must be eaten, the time frame in which he has to eat the worms, how they are cooked, progression of friendships, climax scenes, etc., nothing is the same. but somehow, it did not ruin the movie for me. the characters are all enjoyable, and the film did not leave me disappointed. word of caution for parents, there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when billy's little brother referred to his penis as a "dilly dick". the embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us, "does anybody know what a dilly dick is?" lol. that and an occasional "shut up" is as foul mouthed as this film gets. my daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 (and was holding the empty nacho container just in case) but was fine by worm 6. she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience.
