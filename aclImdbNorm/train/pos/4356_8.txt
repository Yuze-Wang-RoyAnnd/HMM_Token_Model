"the thing about my folks" came in as a surprise. we had no idea about what to expect. the film directed by raymond defelitta, and based on a screen play by one of its stars, paul reiser, proved to be a pleasant time at the movies. although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome, this is a voyage of discovery where ben gets to know his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, ben sees his father for what he really is, and not the mythical figure he has in his mind.<br /><br />the film seems to be a vehicle for its star, peter falk, and he runs away with the movie, as it was expected. mr. falk, one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years, is an actor of such stature, he must be reckoned with. as sam kleinman, the distant father to ben, he is a man that clearly is misunderstood, not only by ben, but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty-seven years.<br /><br />when muriel, the matriarch of the kleinman clan, runs away, everyone goes into a panic because this woman, who has been the strong figure of the family, is vital to keep everyone together. not knowing where she has gone, sam shows up at ben's house confused as he feels abandoned, suddenly, by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years.<br /><br />ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of manhattan into the country. the trip provides the excuse for ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son. along the way, father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children. the love of sam for muriel spans the many years they have known one another; they seem inseparable.<br /><br />peter falk is magnificent in the film. he makes an excellent sam kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst. mr. falk shines as the older man and there's never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him.<br /><br />not being a paul reiser fan, we must confess that as ben kleinman, he is right. ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for muriel, the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together. olympia dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. she makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother. elizabeth perkins plays rachel with great style..<br /><br />the film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of dan gillham, and the excellent musical score by steven argila. ultimately, the film shows a great team effort between its director, mr. defelitta and paul reiser who wrote it for the screen.<br /><br />although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience, it should please anyone.
