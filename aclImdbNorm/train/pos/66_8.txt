"home room" came as a total surprise. not having a clue as to what it was all about, it paid off big time because it doesn't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates, who are the innocent victims of his rash actions.<br /><br />paul ryan, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast.<br /><br />alicia browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school. she has been away a couple of years and doesn't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students. for one, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit. alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died, supposedly killed by her boyfriend. alicia, we realize, is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life, but we are not given any clues to that effect.<br /><br />what follows is the aftermath of the tragedy, as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it. deanna cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn't have been at the school, at all. when a ricochet bullet hit her, she is hospitalized with more than a wound. she is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don't let her forget.<br /><br />alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal. since she doesn't cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows. alicia dislikes deanna, but in a matter of days, both girls will make peace. we don't realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school.<br /><br />busy phillips makes an excellent alicia and erika christiansen is equally good as deanna. victor garber, james pinkins, taylor holland, and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble.<br /><br />the film has an intensity because it's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred, which helps the tone that mr. ryan wanted to give this movie.
