first saw this movie in about 1990, and absolutely died laughing through it. it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends, and we'd quote from it at the drop of a hat ("i'm going home in a bag!"). needless to say, the humor is still there, 15 years later. it's become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film (good thing you can still buy it off ebay!) i've found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek..and this movie provides it all- pathos, suspense, unrequited love,nobility and the list goes on. royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller. i remember seeing him in "the 7 faces of dr. lao" as a bad guy who met a bad end. here, you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning. <br /><br />if you aren't careful, you'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie. the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments, little subtle costume digs at other sci-fi movies, and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e. coyote!<br /><br />don't spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people- this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking, and shouldn't be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they won't know they're being mocked..).<br /><br />-now if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna go get a 'zag-nut' bar....<br /><br />-ramsay "rc" cowlishaw, karaoke dj/entertainer
