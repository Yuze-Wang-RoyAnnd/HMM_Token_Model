generally speaking, the plot was much better than i was expecting. the laugh track was a bit annoying at times and did tend to get in the way; however, there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it. my biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers. spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light in the earlier promotions, but his character comes across quite well in the pilot. there is is enough eye-candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them. now, if the writers can just live up to what they have begun.
