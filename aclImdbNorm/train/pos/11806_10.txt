everything was better in past days. even children's television. and fraggle rock proves my point quite easily. at the time of writing this comment i am fourteen years old but even in my teen years i can't resist the charm of fraggle rock. for those of you that have indeed been living under a rock (haha!), fraggle rock is about a horde of playful and goofy creatures called fraggles who live-amazingly-in a rock. but they're not the only creatures. the rock is inhabited with many other species like the hardworking doozers and countless living plants. outside the rock on one side live inventor-scientist doc and his dog sprocket (who later befriends gobo fraggle), on the other side a family of gorgs-supposed rulers of the universe. the five main fraggles gobo (fearless leader), mokey (arty and peaceful), wembley (indecisive and a friend to gobo), boober (a pessimistic domestic god) and red (loves anything to do with sport and general feistyness)get caught up in some strange situations each episode while at the same time sing and dance their cares away.<br /><br />fraggle rock is definitely a family show-the plots may have intricate details that infants may not follow well, but the song-and-dance routines will hold their attention. the characters are strong and likable, their conflicts believable and their adventures thrilling. the gorgs are frightening, doc and sprocket enlightening, uncle travelling matt hilarious (the postcard segments are very 80s!) and the final episode, change of address, genuinely touching. let's go down to fraggle rock again!
