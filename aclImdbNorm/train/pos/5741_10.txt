one of my favorite movies i saw at preview in seattle. tom hulce was amazing, with out words could convey his feelings/thoughts. i actually sent mike ferrell some donation money to help the film get distributed. it is good. system says i need more lines but do not want to give away plot stuff. i was in the audience in seattle with hulce and director , a writer i think and mike ferrell. they talked for about an hour afterwords. not really a dry eye in the house. why hollywood continues to be stupid i do not know. ( actually i do know , it is our fault, look what we watch)well you get what you pay for guys. get this and see it with someone special. it is a gem.
