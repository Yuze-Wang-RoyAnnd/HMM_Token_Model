108: tarzan and his mate (1934) - released 4/20/1934, viewed 8/6/08.<br /><br />john dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in iowa. bonnie & clyde kill two highway patrolman in texas. births: ralph nader, gloria steinem, alan arkin, richard chamberlain.<br /><br />doug: after we were rather disappointed with the original 'tarzan the ape man,' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film, 'tarzan and his mate,' was the best in the series. it's true. i got a huge kick out of this movie. johnny weismuller returns as the titular vine-swinging, animal dueling wild super-hero, and maureen o'sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane (who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here). in my review for 'ape man,' i stomped on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming, but she's redeemed herself for me here. make no mistake: o'sullivan is the star of this movie, and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. she acts as the ambassador between holt and tarzan, she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals, and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she's out of bullets. she's even got her own jungle scream now. the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible. she's totally got him trained. cheeta is quite charming as well, taking drags off of martin's cigarette. the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the jungle's most vicious animals, especially lions, crocodiles, and rhinos. the effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely. oh, and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. all i can say is: yes, she is naked. very exciting stuff.<br /><br />kevin: wow. just wow. when it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action/adventure, nothing holds a candle to 'tarzan and his mate.' the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kick-ass, violent and risqu'e jungle epic. i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does. you'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code-approved, or animal rights-approved for that matter. the gruesome violence doesn't even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure movies. and after t&j enter the picture, there's plenty of early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swims. see it for yourself if you don't believe me. i love maureen o'sullivan most of all in this film. in the first film, jane seemed like a walking contradiction, like the writers back then just didn't know how to portray a character like that. but here she is a great precursor to kick-butt females of later cinema. although she still requires tarzan's assistance in getting her out of most jams, she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued. her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. i watched this with my mom, and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan "trained," as jeff foxworthy put it. she totally has the ape man at her every beck and call. although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film, there is still plenty of hair-raising tarzan vs. predator battles that are performed (mostly) for real. that and the men-dressed-as-apes are a lot more convincing this time around. **spoiler** the film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing. although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious, i can't help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again. **end spoiler** one of things that still bothers me is johnny weissmuller's smooth, hairless bod and over-styled coif. other than that, this is pre-code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed.<br /><br />last film: it happened one night (1934). next film: twentieth century (1934).
