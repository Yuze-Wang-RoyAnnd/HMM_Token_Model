this show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between "pushing daisies" style and anyone else's was not a steal. (yes, i've seen "amelie." "pushing daisies" is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original.) rather, there are too few shows on tv that have this kind of quirky charm. the greatest similarity is to "dead like me" but "p.d" comes by that similarity honestly: bryan fuller created both shows. (both shows involve an "undead" young woman, for example.) this show never stopped being funny and charming, and it was always odd, yet was consistently humane.<br /><br />i must say a word about the conventions of on-going story lines. some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first (and several subsequent) episodes ned seems to get away with causing the death of chuck's father without consequences of any kind. first of all, this must be a new definition of "without consequences of any kind" because, in spite of the fact that ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of chuck's father, he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done. further, about a dozen episodes into the series, ned finally did confess to chuck that he had caused her father's death with his gift. now, there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person's death by bringing another person back to life, so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance. in other words, it's between ned and chuck, who was not inclined to forgive ned anytime soon.<br /><br />but this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas. i remember when david caruso's character on "nypd blue" did something wrong and it seemed he got away with it--for a whole year--then he got caught and was forced to resign from the job (and left the show). the point is, viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode, and is not caught in that episode, that he has gotten away with it. there is always next week--and maybe even next year.
