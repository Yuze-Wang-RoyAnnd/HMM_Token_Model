brand hauser (john cusack) is an assassin for the cia. he is ordered to go to the country of turaquistan, a nation that the united states has "liberated", and kill a businessman named omar shariff. this is because the american conglomerate, tamerlane, that is putting the country "back together" will not stand for shariff, an oil man from a neighboring state, laying down his own pipeline through war-torn turquistan. but, once there, brand runs into difficulties. one, he meets a determined journalist, natalie (marisa tomei) who wants to tell the american public the "true" story of the region's conflict...and of tamerlane. but, brand is aghast to realize that natalie's pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compels him to lose focus on his mission. also, his cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the country's pop-singing princess, yonica (hillary duff), who will be getting married at the convention center. she is a young diva whose wedding arrangements also turn brand's attention away from the coming assassination. with other inept underlings and complications, will brand be able to carry out his mission, for the satisfaction of tamerlane's big boss, the former vice-president (dan ackroyd)? good for you, john cusack, to make this film, even though it doesn't quite hold together. shot in serbia, it is a worthy look at what present-day iraq must be like, a country turned upside-down. in a stroke a brilliance, the green zone here is called "the emerald city" and aptly so, for this oz-like neighborhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis. the cast is very fine, with cusack doing a nice job and tomei, joan cusack, ben kingsley, ackroyd and others backing him up in style. duff, especially, does a great turn as the heavily-accented, heavily made-up, potty-mouthed singer. the recreation of war-riddled baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top-notch. as for the script, it isn't always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes. for example, a young turaqui boy offers to show brand an enemy hideout, in exchange for money and candy. brand produces the cash but, because he has no candy, the boy burns his vehicle anyway. brilliant! then, also, the direction is not a total success but doesn't lag very often. no, if you have conservative leanings, you probably won't like this film one bit. but, if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the "war on terrorism", this is quite a good show. therefore, do make an effort to view it, as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio "formulas".
