splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix: mystery, thriller, musical. briefly, we are allowed to tell about the story: a girl comes into a european cafeteria and then... soft transit from nonsense mystery to narrative logic. in a no time, no place way vigalondo managed a delight in b/w by means of imagination and despite (thanks to) the tightest of budgets.<br /><br />because of the unity of time-space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku). spain, land of quick poetry in b/w (?remember the early bu~nuel?).<br /><br />a must see for reassuring our belief in young cinema outside the states.
