a bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of great depression. it tells us about another notorious hit-man, michael (mike) salliwan. somehow, this time the story turns the other way round: mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss. he succeeds in his revenge and secures honorable future to his son, but gets killed in the end. such stories never have happy end after all.<br /><br />the role of mike salliwan senior was wonderfully played by tom hanks, and the part of mr. rooney (the mafia boss) was performed by paul newman. the film makes a great impression, and we hear the well-known phrase "we rob banks". this film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from sam mendes after his american beauty.
