this movie (with the alternate title "martial law 3" for some reason) introduced me to jeff wincott for the first time. and it was a great introduction. although i had never heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent fighter. the action scenes in this movie are great! there are lots of them too, by the way. the recruit fight at the peacekeepers hq is especially good. there's just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people that's really fun. and for the rest of the cast: brigitte nielsen was a good choice for the villain. roles like this fits her (but others don't). matthias hues also did a good job, as always. he's a great fighter and macho-like character, and was a good rival for wincott in this movie.
