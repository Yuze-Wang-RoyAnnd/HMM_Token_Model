well the story is a little hard to follow the first time, but that's only because of all the bare breasted '70s painted-up vampire/witches dancing to the bongo drums. this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies. and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them. and for girl on girl action, vampiric or not...this movie just rocks!!!
