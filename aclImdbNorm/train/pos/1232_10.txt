very funny film. classic film funny eddie murphy of the 80s. i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory. the classic irony of murphy does not fail, the film is funny, well done. murphy in the'80s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous. the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from 1986 up to now have changed. the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period. a nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic murphy, an actor who has recently disappeared. the final part is anthologies, the likable actor who plays the part of the tibetan monk. that's it.
