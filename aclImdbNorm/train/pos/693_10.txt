this is an almost action-less film following jack, an insomniac, as he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself off a building, and, for a lot of the time, can't tell reality from hallucination.<br /><br />dominic monaghan, as jack, is truly believable. confused, and scared but lethargic and, at times blankly accepting of what he sees, we follow him trying to sort out what he's seeing and find a way to sleep.<br /><br />introduce a talking dog (another hallucination) and children that suddenly appear in jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there (more hallucination) and you have an interesting, mind boggling, 43 minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more.
