dr. mordrid, what can i say? jeffrey combs has done it again!<br /><br />anton mordrid has been on earth for 100 years waiting for kabal, an evil sorcerer, to come so he can kill him. mordrid and kabal used to train together as kids, so mordrid knows all kabal's tricks.<br /><br />the film as a little bit confusing at begin with, but soon you feel a part of the action. i won't give away the ending, so go and watch doctor mordrid!<br /><br />i found the film to be very enjoyable because it doesn't have a lot of violence in, nor sexual scenes. the film focused on the plot and that's what i like! i find the best films are the ones where times seems to fly by. this is because you are so engrossed in the film. doctor mordrid is a fantasticly engrossing movie! i give it a 20 out of 10. worth seeing!<br /><br />
