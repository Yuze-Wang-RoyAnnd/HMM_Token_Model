this show has a few clich'es and a few over the top, dawson's creek-like moments (a 16-year-old talking about way back when life made sense?), but overall it seems like a decent show. most of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end. i just hope every episode doesn't turn out to be life-altering like the first, that would just be too much drama for this vehicle. jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of.
