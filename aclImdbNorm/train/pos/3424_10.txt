the information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately. the walter reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return.<br /><br />what this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars. the psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life. they are not just changed or affected, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves.<br /><br />finally, this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in prosecuting war that leads to all the psychological trauma.<br /><br />we have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands that will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma because of this war. it doesn't matter what side you are on, it behooves you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business. this film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly.
