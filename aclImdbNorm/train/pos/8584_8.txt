sergeant ryker is accused of being a traitor during the korean war, a hanging offense. a long drawn out court-marshal ensues during which time the sgt. must remain in a military jail. after much investigation the defense attorney attempts to exonerate the doomed non-com with an eleventh hour ploy. very good picture.
