i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it. charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine. his sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero. i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner: a bit of "axel foley through the looking glass". charlotte lewis is, to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable, luminously gorgeous. some scenes are wonderfully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the silly fight scenes, and the climactic confrontation. through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth, a stunned and quieter version of kurt russell in his oriental fantasy romp. like that movie we have james hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, however short, raise the quality even of derek. since 1955 hong has defined the fine supporting actor, the "class act" of his profession. "the golden child" is silly; it is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy, well worth watching. after four years i have seen "the golden child" again; i enjoyed it even more! it truly is great fun.
