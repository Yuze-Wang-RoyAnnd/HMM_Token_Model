i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. purple rain not only broke boundaries, it set a decade, the costumes, the music, the behavior, and the dancing! to this day, my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution.<br /><br />now the movie itself, i just meant what i said in the title, because for the most part, this movie itself is made by the music. the acting? please don't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means. but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and jarome, their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious. i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie.<br /><br />prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music. while the movie and acting is pretty bad, this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too. this movie defined the 80's, so just have fun with it. prince would want it that way, just to party on down! oh, boy, that sounded lame.<br /><br />9/10
