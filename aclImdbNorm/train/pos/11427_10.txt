i loved this film because in my mind it seemed to so perfectly capture what i imagined life in french colonial africa must have been like in the 50's ("my" generation anyway). but i was truly enraptured by its quiet pacing and by the glorious ending. within the last 5 minutes of this film, you must focus intently on what's happening. never have i been more impressed with the "wrap-up" of a film. i remember yelling "wow!" when i realized it was over. on the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch!!
