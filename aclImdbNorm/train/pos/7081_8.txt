the story of this film is truly remarkable. a virus cut loose and only 1% of the human race survived. the only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say, "the twelve monkeys did it." thats right, the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 billion people. apparently animals do not contract this disease. day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this; how it was created; if nature did it or a mere human being had created it. all they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them, the deaths began during 1996-1997, and twelve monkeys have something to do with it. (or at least thats what the poster says.) so a current convict named james cole (bruce willis) is sent as a "volunteer" to get some samples from above. after he does his "volunteer" work, he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world. cole accepts and the story of the twelve monkeys begin.<br /><br />throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times, from 1990, to some time during the 1950's. (in a middle of a war.) throughout the time traveling back and forth, it starts to mess james up in the head and that twist the story up. the whole story is very well done and i would of gave it a higher grade if it wasn't for the ending. i personally didn't like the ending of the movie and i was very disappointed. i just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen, but it isn't everyone who thinks this way. so i gave it a 8, but if everyone had the same opinion as me i would give it a 6 or 7.<br /><br />for the whole acting of the film, i give it a a+. bruce willis is great for this role and he acts good, but brad pitt is completely 100% excellent. his acting is so great, he gets into the character so well. i never really cared for brad pitt in till i saw him in this and fight club. there characters or similar in this film, he is just a little more... insane in this film. so overall i think this film is completely worth checking out. for most people it's a great science fiction film, i just don't think it is a masterpiece.
