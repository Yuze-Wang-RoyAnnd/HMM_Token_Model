i enjoyed this film. but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. it was amusing at times, but really, it wasn't very funny at all. if i'd been expecting it to be a comedy, i might have been disappointed with the film, but, going in with no expectations, i found it to be enjoyable and engaging. maybe it was because, as an engineer, i identified with the protagonist. i was less concerned with satire of capital or labor, and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. a man who's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. he's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. so i find it interesting that people here have compared it to jurassic park; me, i compare it to the fountainhead.
