why the crap is this movie rated so low?! i've seen this movie over 25 times, i know every line to this movie. it's obvious that i love this movie. trey parker and matt stone (creators of south park and the new puppet masterpiece team america) star as the main characters joe cooper, or coop "airman" cooper, and doug remer, or "sir swish." mainly they're just referred to as coop and remer throughout the movie. right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called "townsell." i must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts: "and after playing for new england, san diego, huston, saint louis, a year for the toronto arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the desert inn i'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami." his agent leans over: "minnesota." let us not forget this important piece of the movie. so it starts that coop and remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. outside they create the sport baseketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. after shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. during this time they manage to recruit their third team mate squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. as the movie follows we find out that coop, remer, and squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left. the story follows with zany blackmail, the milwaukee beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd it'll leave you crying for more. watch it dude, it's hilarious.
