with a minimal budget, a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination, nacho vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts i've ever seen. the subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable, since it doesn't give the ending away until the very last moment.<br /><br />don't let anybody tell you what the short is about, since you'll be able to enjoy it a lot more. nacho vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: directing, writing and acting in this formidable short is the most remarkable effort i've seen in years. also pay attention to the performance of marta belenguer, her reaction shots are incredible.<br /><br />overall rating: 8/10
