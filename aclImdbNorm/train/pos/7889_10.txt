the movie freddy's dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other nightmare on elm street , yes it has comedy essence about it , so has all the other films, but how can anyone possibly say that you wouldn't find freddy krueger scary , if you were to come across this man in your dreams you wouldn't find him even more scary with a comic essence about him because his comedy shows that he doesn't care at all about killing you that he finds it extremely funny, and freddy also plays comic mind games with them, which in its own way is very disturbing , by using his comic ways i think that makes the horror movies nightmare on elm street what they are today, the writers are extremely clever making krueger comic and scary as oppose to jason vorhees , who doesn't say anything and hasn't got the wit to truly frighten his victims, this movie is about as good as freddy's wit gets and i would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour and by the way " don't fall asleep!".
