parker and stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results. much of the film is trey and matt running amok with their new toy box. the plot is simplicity itself: two average guys invent a new sport, a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze. along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up, along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights. it runs like a stretched south park episode, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, toilet humour and homilies from the heart.<br /><br />if this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us "airplane" and the "naked gun" series. this influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional yasmine bleeth in the role usually given to priscilla presley. robert vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since "bullitt" and ernest borgnine overacts as only he can, but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner.<br /><br />for those who haven't noticed yet, parker and stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics. this manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create. as usual, they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-pc vehicle dvda.<br /><br />a special mention must go to dian bachar, who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing stan to parker and stone's rampaging pair of cartmans.<br /><br />in summary, this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the "naked gun/airplane" formula. parker and stone could do something truly brilliant (or absolutely awful) if given full control over a future film. america, either lock these guys up or put them in charge.
