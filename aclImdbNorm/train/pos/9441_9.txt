the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters,as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.the horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors,playing parts.i have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this one.burt reynolds and jon voight were never better on screen,as well as fine performances by ned beatty,ronny cox,bill mckinney,and though he appeared only briefly,james dickey,the man who authored the book upon which the film is based,as the sheriff of aintry.it is somewhat disturbing,and kids,of course,should be shielded from it,but this is great,dramatic cinema.
