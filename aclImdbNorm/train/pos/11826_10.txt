i never attended the midnight showing of a movie before "dick tracy" came out.<br /><br />i still have the "t-shirt ticket" i had to wear to get admitted to the showing around here somewhere and, like that shirt, "dick tracy" has stuck with me ever since.<br /><br />if you've seen the movie, the sharp visuals, bright primary colors and strong characters have no doubt been etched into your brain. it's a wonder to behold.<br /><br />as director/star/co-writer/producer, beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here, taking a familiar american icon and re-creating him for a whole new era. still set in the '30s, "tracy" has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do. i've lost track of how many times i've watched "tracy" and i still catch something new every time i do.<br /><br />the others are all top notch, starting with pacino's big boy caprice (a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them), even madonna's breathless mahoney is a relevation in that under the right environment, she can act (gasp!). <br /><br />but there's still such themes touched on as the necessity of family, keeping true to one's self, good versus evil, even machiavellian themes are explored. odd for a comic strip film, but hey, it works.<br /><br />all in all, "dick tracy" is a classic unto itself. compared with other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. it's a good, strong film that doesn't depend on blood, violence, profanity or nudity to make its point. <br /><br />there's a lesson to be learned here.<br /><br />ten stars. great scott!
