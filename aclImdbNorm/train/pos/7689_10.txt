this was what black society was like before the crack epidemics, gangsta rap, and aids that beset the ghettos in the eighties. decent, hardworking families that struggled to get by and all the traumas and tribulations they faced. black america was a different group of people in the seventies. still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movements of the sixties, times were hard but still worth fighting for. keepin' your head above water, making a wave when you can, this show showed how black society struggled to work together as people and families, before they started to prey on each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the ghettos. it is heart-breaking to see what the black ghettos were like then and what they have become now.
