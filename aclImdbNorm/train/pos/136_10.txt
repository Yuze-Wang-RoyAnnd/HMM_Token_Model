this movie is a great way for the series to finally end. peter (the boy from puppet master iii) is all grown up and is now the puppet master. well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulon's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets. most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii, puppet master iii, puppet master 4, puppet master 5, curse of the puppet master, and retro puppet master (sorry... but i guess paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from 1). personally i wish puppet master vs. demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say "this is the final movie in the series..."
