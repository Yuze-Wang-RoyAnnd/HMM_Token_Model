before lost everything shown on tv was predictable . you could predict who was gonna die or who will find something, but in lost you could predict nothing. every thing was so surprisingly stunning and it really was a mystery not because it has so many secrets but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great. i literally became addicted to it. lost is a classic work of art. it gives you something to look forward to every week. it is genius. the surrounding is brilliant it is calm and warm at the beach and so scary in the jungle. the characters are a work of genius every one of them especially the ones already on the island. the castaways are so dramatic yet we can never predict their deaths because they have so much more to do and so much more to say and they have secrets affecting the other castaways that die with them.
