this is an amazing film, both for the incredibly energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing, and from the unique way that the filmmakers interweave the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it. spellbinding is the only word i can use to describe the experience. this is not 'bizet's carmen' by any usual standard. this is not a usual film by any standard. every nuanced glance, every stomp of the foot, every piece of the music is intertwined so captivatingly that you can't take your eyes off the screen. you don't need to love opera or flamenco(i don't)to be captured, enraptured, enthralled by this film. subtle and direct; loud and still; one of, if not the best, movies of it's kind, because there are so few like it.
