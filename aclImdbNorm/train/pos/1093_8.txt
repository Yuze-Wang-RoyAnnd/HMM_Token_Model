i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv.<br /><br />the one scene that always stands out, for me that is, is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman, where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says "did you get that, that's yellow, blue, green and white"
