hardly a masterpiece. not so well written. beautiful cinematography i think not. this movie wasn't too terrible but it wasn't that much better than average. the main story dealing with highly immoral teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was... should have really gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically "because mom says we can't." some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters. couple times i was wondering if the writer/director was a fan of george lucas' classic american graffiti. not that it's wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that, i mean come on! worst part of this was that madchen amick had such a small part, i mean double come on!! she was the only one, in one or two lines, who actually tried a southern accent. (take a good listen, it was there even though her character was from california! doh!!) maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more authentically sounding movie. oh well, what can ya do when you have a director who's just a director and not an artist, also. too bad. overall i give this a b- and that's being a little generous 'cause i'm partial to ms. amick.
