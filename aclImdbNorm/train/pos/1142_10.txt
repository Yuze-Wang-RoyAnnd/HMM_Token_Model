till hbo began rerunning it this month. i remember laughing out loud in the theater back in 1991, and now again in my living room. if i see that it's on, i have to watch it. there's just no question. this is so much more entertaining to me than other, more popular spoofs like airplane! (which i really like, btw). cathy moriarty steals the show in my opinion. quotes like "sudden speech! the last symptoms of brain fever! she could blow at any moment!" put me over the edge. and whoopie goldberg hasn't been this funny since 'jumpin' jack flash'. kevin klein, sally field, robert downey jr. all turn in superb performances as expected. i started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars, but then i realized that for the type of film it's supposed to be, there isn't one thing i'd change or improve upon. so 10 it is. i have to get this on dvd, that's just all there is to it.
