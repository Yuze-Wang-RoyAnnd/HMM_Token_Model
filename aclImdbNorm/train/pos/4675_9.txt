i saw "brother's shadow" at the tribeca film festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later. the story of a prodigal son (scott cohen) returning to his family's custom furniture business after a stint in jail, it offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama--memorable characters; sharp, observant dialog; sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually.<br /><br />but more than that, it presents something that is all too rare at the multiplex these days: the uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility. the talent of director-screenwriter todd s. yellin seems to emerge full-blown, but we get the sense he (like his protagonist) has paid his dues. he knows how real people struggle in this world, and he knows how we yearn to see--or at least, to experience vicariously--success. yet yellin respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke up our rear ends. in the end, we see that jake's triumph doesn't lie in commissions, or even in the esteem of his family, but in "the work" he couldn't abandon if he tried.<br /><br />it's an essential theme in a world (and especially a movie industry) that can't rise above "the bottom line". this film deserves a wide audience.
