i consider this film to be the best one about mike hammer, with biff elliott's performance the definitive mike hammer. harry essex's script is excellent and contains many improvements on mickey spillane's novel. his direction is strong and imaginative, and he makes fine use of light and shadow. the camera work by john alton is top-notch, as is the score by franz waxman. the cast includes many veteran players, as well as peggie castle in her memorable performance as charlotte manning. all in all, this is one of the finest private eye films ever made. biff elliott and haary essex should have received more opportunities. i have always treasured this film.
