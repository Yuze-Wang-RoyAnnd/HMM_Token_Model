for me this movie was powerful. i don't want to be a spoiler, but i had a friend years ago; we were like brothers. this movie brought back some vivid memories.<br /><br />for some reason, i couldn't place my vote for this movie which would have been a 10. i kept getting a message like "no votes have been placed...." and yet i saw in the stats that there were. will try again tomorrow (monday).<br /><br />minor flaws i overlooked. it was the relationships between the characters that got me. beautifully acted and real situations. i've been in a couple of them.<br /><br />a small gem of a movie. just like "spring forward" is another overlooked gem. i'm very glad movies like these are still being made; about relationships between people, well written, sensitively unfolded with first-class acting and direction. after all, isn't that what it's all about?
