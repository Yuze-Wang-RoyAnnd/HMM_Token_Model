"bend it like beckham" is a film that got very little exposure here in the united states. it was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly british in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football, (soccer here), which some may have trouble relating too in the u.s. it's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here. i think the basis of the storyline, (following a dream), is something many people can relate to and in the end, "bend it like beckham" proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting. i was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now i regret not seeing it sooner. i highly recommend this movie!
