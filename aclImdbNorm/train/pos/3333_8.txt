i got to see this on the plane to nz last week, and was wondering how it would measure up to both the uk film and the book. i have to say i was favorable impressed. if anything the fanatical attachment to the red sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to arsenal fc, who have had success through the years. as a brit i was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what's going on. one question springs to mind - was the screenplay written using the sox as the team even before they finally broke the curse of the bambino? or was another team in the frame? as a red sox fan myself (weird i know, a brit who understands baseball) i have to say that it added to the enjoyment.
