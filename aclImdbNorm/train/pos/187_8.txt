marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy "show people" released by mgm in 1928. davies plays a hick from savannah, georgia, who arrives in hollywood with her father (dell henderson). the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is davies outrageous southern costume. davies lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. she meets fellow slapstick star william haines, who is immediately smitten with her. well, davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio ("high art studios") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces. a handsome but fake actor (andre telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star. davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course learns that is not who she really is. marion davies is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a "serious" actress. william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self, and there are cameos by charles chaplin, john gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, king vidor. this is a silent film with a few "sound effects" as sound pictures were just coming into their own. a treasure of a film.
