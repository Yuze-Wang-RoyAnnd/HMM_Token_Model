having only seen two of his pictures previously, i've come to terms with altman. before, though, i always labeled his style of film-making "boring." you just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius.<br /><br />"health" is fairly underrated, and very questionably out of print. in fact, i don't think it's ever even been issued to vhs. why is that? when all of these crappy films get dvd releases daily, this one is left behind for no good reason? honestly, i had no real problems with this film. it was, for the most part, consistently amusing and funny. almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances. there is real skill here.<br /><br />and paul dooley's stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating.<br /><br />if you can, try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem. it's not perfect, but it's much better than most of the sludge out there getting dvd releases. hell, i'd be happy with a nice vhs copy of this thing.<br /><br />it's often on the fox movie channel, though, so look out for it.
