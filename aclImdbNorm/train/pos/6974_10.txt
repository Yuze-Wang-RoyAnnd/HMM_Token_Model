i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review! i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica ( being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything i could of the shows universe )so i didn't know what to expect...but i did come out with a smile though i must admit...<br /><br />the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters...i won't give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but i suggest you watch this.<br /><br />must say...esai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adama...(father of the admiral in battlestar galactica)i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsg...<br /><br />also eric stoltz fits his role precisely...! special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome! don't sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it..without having to have see bsg!.<br /><br />this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci-fi kick!
