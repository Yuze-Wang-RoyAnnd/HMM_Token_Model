vivah is in my book the best movie of 2006 ! period !!. in my book it is one of the best 100 movies ever made in bollywood. its sad that this movie doesn't have that many reviews and isn't having that much popularity. <br /><br />vivah is once again a true achievement from a director who does it again. after hahk and maine pyar kiya sooraj has once again pulled off a brilliant one vivah. <br /><br />this is the most simple and cute movies that i've seen this year. after seeing don 2 which was crap and later dhoom 2 which even beat don in that matter, i finally see a movie which is so close to my heart and my culture.<br /><br />i don't know why bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture which we have and are making hollywood remake style crap movies like dhoom 2 and don. <br /><br />the story is beautiful and relates much to the indian system of arranged marriage which i too would like to be a part of. our system which teaches us to obey elders, follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie!. of course there isn't any force in choosing your life partner and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and its up to them to decide as it is brilliantly shown in this movie. <br /><br />coming back to the movie.....vivah is a story of journey between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage. the phase where the guy meets the girl !....both understand each other ..both try to assess if they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the various which occur during marriages.<br /><br />amrita rao is brilliant in the movie.......shahid is ok.....and alok nath and anupam kher are awesome !! the songs are brilliant. ! i especially like the hamari shaadi main hafte reh gye chaar and do anjaane ajnabi ......<br /><br />overall a must see for anyone who still believes in the indian culture and tradition and i certainly do !.<br /><br />go see this movie......i just have to say one word.......<br /><br />bliss !.
