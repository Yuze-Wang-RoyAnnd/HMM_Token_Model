"moonstruck" is one of the best films ever. i own that film on dvd! the movie deals with a new york widow (cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (danny aiello) angry brother (nicholas cage) who works at a bakery. i'm glad cher won an oscar for that movie. nicholas cage and danny aiello are great, too. the direction from norman jewison (who directed "fiddler on the roof") is fantastic. "moonstruck" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. a must-see!<br /><br />10/10 stars!
