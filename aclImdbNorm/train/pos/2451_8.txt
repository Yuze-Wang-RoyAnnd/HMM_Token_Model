george lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom. the first episodes i saw of this too often made jokes at the expense of his mom. as i have watched this more, there has been more & more variety. no one on the cast is really safe from his wit now.<br /><br />it seems to me as this season has progressed that george is getting more comfortable with the family sitcom dad role. at first he wasn't, but he is getting more & more into a groove. this makes both him & the shows progressively funnier. they had added a couple of characters for george to play off this year too. his wife's dad is getting more & more involved in the plot.<br /><br />his mom is still there, but not as central as past seasons. i think it is prudent to say with george's sense of comic timing, & abc's lack of good sitcoms, george lopez has a good chance of being here on abc long after george w. bush.
