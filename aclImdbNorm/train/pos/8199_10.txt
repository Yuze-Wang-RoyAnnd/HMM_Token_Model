after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer(1976) to be the final chapter in the series. dirty harry is back, older, more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic.<br /><br />dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer, vigilante cops, and vietnam veteran terrorists. but now he's after a new killer, a killer who wants payback, by gunning down her attackers.<br /><br />sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry. callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman(played by sondra locke), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who is left traumitized. ten years after, she's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers. at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack, of which the mob are hunting him as well. so in order to let the heat die down within the city, harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town, but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well, while hunting her attackers one by one. harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar, as he homes in on the killer's trails.<br /><br />sudden impact in my opinion, has to be one of my top 10 revenge films, as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet, far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined. sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had, a dark tone with entertaining value.<br /><br />so do you feel lucky, punk?
