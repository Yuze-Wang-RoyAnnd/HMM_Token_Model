i was going to give it an 8, but since you people made 6.5 out of a lot better votes, i had to up my contribution. the river styx was pure genius. sure, woody was his perennial stuff, but at least his role was appropriate. the first half hour was really hilarious, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. the dialog was clever enough, and woody's card tricks at the parties, along with the reaction from the upper crust, were fun to watch. this was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be. and a plus, a little sorcerer's apprentice to go along with it. and of course, did you notice that johansen is getting a bit frumpy? charles dance is always entertaining, as was hugh jackman.
