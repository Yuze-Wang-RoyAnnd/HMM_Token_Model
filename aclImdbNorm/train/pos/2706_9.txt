i saw this film at the international film festival of brussels. i also met the director of the film. i heard that ed wood wrote the story in 10 years! i'm sure he thought his would be his masterpiece - his triumph.<br /><br />well, if you take the film seriously (like mr. wood did) it is really one of the worst films you will ever see. and this is cool. the big joke of i woke up early the day i died is that it doesn't even try to be a decent film.<br /><br />this makes the film very, very good. the script is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humour. billy zane's role is absolutely excellent. you see, this is either high art...or low rubbish.<br /><br />****/*****
