aardman does it again. next to pixar, aardman animation proves again and again how to do animation properly.<br /><br />i had a great time watching the first episode of creature comforts. i thought it translated well for american audiences. my only concern is that most of the audiences aren't going to get the subtle humor in this show.<br /><br />having been a fan of the bbc version and the short film, i knew what i was in for when i sat down to watch this. the animators did a great job matching up pre-recorded voices to a perfect match animal. look at the first episode with the goat, who sounds stoned, and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other "dawg".<br /><br />is this for everyone? not by a long shot. in fact, i'd be happy to see the show last for a full season. but like i said before, audiences aren't going to get it.
