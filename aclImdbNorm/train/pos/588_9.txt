i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land. in a river runs through it, redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt. this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean, and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot (serpent's kiss, reigne margot).<br /><br />redford's cast is perfect. tom skerritt is the rev. maclean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible, brenda blythen, the mother, and his sons, craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. it is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years.<br /><br />what makes these relationships special however, is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. this is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains. the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in redford's directorial hands. given the material, redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.
