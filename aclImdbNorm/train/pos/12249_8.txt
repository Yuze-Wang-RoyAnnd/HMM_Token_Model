old jane's mannered tale seems very popular these days. i have lost count of the number of versions going around. probably the reason is that her "ruts" are our "ruts" even at this late date. this tv mini-series gives it a mannered telling suitable to the novel. headstrong, opinionated emma is a pretty "modern" girl when you think about it, even though the ambience of jane austen's world may seem a tad artificial to us today. if you haven't seem emma, i'll only say that self-sufficient emma does get her comeuppance. it's worth watching to find out how. the acting honours here go to the ladies: kate, prunella, lucy and samantha. they could almost have had a psychic connection to old jane!
