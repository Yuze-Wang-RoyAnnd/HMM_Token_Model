there are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former. this short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience. it presents a simple story, told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going, then just gets better and better. clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including sam rockwell and luiz guzman can easily make it on their own. likeable and funny, hilariously so towards the end, welcome to collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.
