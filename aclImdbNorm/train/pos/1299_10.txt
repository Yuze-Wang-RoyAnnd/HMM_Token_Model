i caught a bit of this concert on public television and knew i had to have it. the boys give everyone at the royal albert an excellent, often thrilling performance complete in every way. pure, too - no synth, no smoke-shrouded lasers and strobes, no grandiose entrance (and an unstoned, serious, and appreciative audience, all of whom left their bottle rockets at home).<br /><br />if you're a cream fan (or if you've only heard of them); if you're a blues fan; if you're a rock 'n' roll fan; you will not be disappointed when you view and listen to this dvd. you also will never lose this dvd because you'll never lend it to anyone. (this dvd justifies selfishness! tell them to get their own!) it's too good and too replayable; you'll want to keep it within easy reach.
