this has to be, hands down, hats off, one of the most uproarious comedies ever made. starting with the animated blowing, popping bubbles, the entrance to the daytime awards, the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet, the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech, the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co-stars and producer, under phony smiles. now that is only in the first few minutes. then, all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous. ridiculous in a good way, no, make that a great way. this was the first time i'd seen the always charming teri hatcher. while i may not be a follower of desperate housewives, she herself is always watchable - same goes for lois & clark. not a huge follower, but if i run across an episode i'd watch it. robert downey, jr., does a great turn as slimy, smarmy, snaky, sycophantic david seaton barnes, the producer who'd give his right eye to see sally field's celeste talbert leave the show, if only to finally get to get it on with cathy moriarty's montana moorehead.<br /><br />moriarty absolutely shines in this movie, just as she had everywhere else she's appeared. here, all she has to do is scream "i hate you i hate you you creep!" or give one of her anti-celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin, and she has me rolling in the aisles. yes, cathy moriarty is a very gifted actress, and one hell of a comedienne. sally field gratefully departs from the usual 70-mm-sized lifetime tragedy of the week movies, and we're all reminded why she is who she is today, having started off in comedy afraid of nothing. her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor, but like a caterpillar in a cocoon, the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was. the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy, serious roles, that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen.<br /><br />how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher, if only for a glorified cameo. she doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen. she takes a role which, in the hands of a lesser actress, could easily have been forgotten, but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself.<br /><br />how lucky was elisabeth shue to get thrown in the middle of all this! at the time, she wasn't really known for much. adventures in babysitting was kind of cute (yes, i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price), but she didn't hold my attention - - much. but here, she makes the most of her character - star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex-co-star-and-lover who, of course, turns out to be the niece's father, and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother.<br /><br />i'll stop there - i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy, or at least a novela. if you've seen it, then reminisce. if you haven't, you've missed a real classic, but not really. the dvd's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years, and this movie is timeless, so what the hell.
