thanks jymn magon, for creating disney's 2 best cartoons ever. this show has improved very much over the years. as a kid, i didn't like it because i thought it was a rip-off of ducktales, which was my favorite disney thing at the time (like grandmoffromero). then later on though it was good but not great. but after reading the reviews here, i decided to give it another chance & bought the dvd set & watched the whole pilot the first day i got it, & was very pleasantly surprised. it's still my favorite episode, although the series did live up to it. and by the end of disc 1, i knew this was going to be a top tenner.<br /><br />the characters are so complex & charming. my favorite has got to be wildcat. he's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot. my next favorite is baloo, the best pilot on the show. i can see why 'ol jymn built the show around him. then it's kit cloudkicker. he & baloo have the best relationship in the series. after that, louie. jim cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice. after him, rebecca. she has made me laugh pretty hard, and i do believe she and baloo eventually marry. and finally(for the heroes), molly. although she's my least favorite, i still like her. i think she's a very cute character(much better than webby from ducktales). and the villains were very original. don karnage & his air pirates always crack me up, kahn is ice-cold and ruthless, and the thembrians are always at least amusing.<br /><br />as said before, the stories range from hilarious(time waits for no bear, romance of red chimp) to nothing short of touching(the old man & the seaduck, paradise lost), to fun, funny & exciting adventures(in search of ancient blunders & my favorite for whom the bell klangs). these are only a few of my favorite episodes. anyway, talespin is disney's best, aside from gummi bears some reasons for this? gb had a decent amount of my favorite character(cubbi), while ts didn't have enough of wildcat. but in the end talespin remains a classic. bottom line- 10/10 6th best cartoon ever.
