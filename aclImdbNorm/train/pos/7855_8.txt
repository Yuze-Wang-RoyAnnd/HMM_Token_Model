tess of the storm country was a mary pickford vehicle i had intended to get for some time. i finally found a vhs copy for a reasonable price and got to enjoy it.<br /><br />mary gives her typical spunky, innocently sexy portrayal of a wrong-side-of-tracks girl who wins the heart of a rich heir. only this time the stakes are higher: a false murder charge, an illegitimate child (and ensuing case of mistaken motherhood) and contemplated suicide.<br /><br />one can see why pickford wanted to redo this one. the story is a real morality tale, the kind that she loved to star in. the controversial topics aren't always spelled out plainly; a viewer has to pay attention and pick up on hints to catch everything that is being implied on first viewing
