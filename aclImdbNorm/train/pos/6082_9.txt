i've always enjoyed kenneth branagh's versions of the shakespeare classics, as he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one who lifts the whole movie, is none other than "the-always-great-actor" laurence fishburne. surely he has made some poor choices in films, even though he's a wonderful actor, but in this one we're truly given the real othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with fishburne's well portrayed paranoia and, furthermore, we're finally given a black othello!<br /><br />i don't think they could have chosen a better othello. who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy, love/hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes...? branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, ir'ene jacob's desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak, whilst laurence fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. do watch it.
