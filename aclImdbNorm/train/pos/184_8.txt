there are no people like "show people" marion davies (as peggy pepper) and william haines (as billy boone). my introduction to ms. davies was a "clip" from this film; the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions. my introduction to mr. haines was in viewing this film, presently; though, it's possible i've seen him in a less memorable role. haines makes an incredible impression, when he joins davies for a commissary meal - tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table. indeed, haines and davies deliver great comic performances.<br /><br />the story starts off with dell henderson (colonel pepper) driving daughter davies into hollywood, certain she will become tinseltown's newest sensation. indeed, davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars. but, davies yearns to become a true drama queen. davies leaves haines, and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli. but, audiences prefer davies in more comic roles; perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life? <br /><br />full of great hollywood location footage, both on the set, and off. full of great "cameos"; at a studio lunch, at the stars' table, davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s. hart. the best "bit" player, however, is charlie chaplin, who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph! while the cameos are fun, they, and the episodic sequences, do help "show people" become less of an important film, and more of an important historical document. <br /><br />******** show people (11/11/28) king vidor ~ marion davies, william haines, dell henderson
