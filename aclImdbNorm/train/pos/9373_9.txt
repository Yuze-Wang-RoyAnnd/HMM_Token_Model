like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing - the 1940s noir films - but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past. the term 'neo-noir' has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact. john dahl's film on the other hand, truly deserved to be described as such. the casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with tay garnett or jacques tourneur. the plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes. james m. cain would have appreciated it. many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don't make them like they used to, and i'm not even that old. movies such as red rock west give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past.
