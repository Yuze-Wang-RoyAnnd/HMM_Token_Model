madhur bhandarkar has given it all raw. but the best part is he hasn't forgotten to give the ingredients. it has come short and crisp to the viewer and it is the audience to make the choice now. page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to it.<br /><br />madhavi (konkan sharma) is a journalist and enjoys her work. a simple and peaceful life adores her with a caring boyfriend and a nice roommate pearl. she covers the page 3 (celebrity page) of nation today, where she has a very supportive editor deepak suri (boman irani.) but life takes turn for her as she hits the first bump and takes herself away from page 3 and goes into crime bit. omigosh! a whole new world was waiting for her there. she is shocked, excited, stunned with the revelation. her reaction has resulted in losing the job. at the end she is back to page 3. now when she meets any celebrity in a party, she knows the actual looks of each, hidden under the illusive face.<br /><br />the movie has a message and it is crude. the audience needs to get it in their own color. the theme and the screenplay was fantastic. there are some very good thoughts applied to prepare the audiences. like the foreplay-club is shown before the pedophiliac exhibition, the short suspense before gay-actions in bathroom. the dialogs are strong and the actors are really good at delivering it. charu mohanty's 2 words speaks volumes and he is very successful in uttering those two words with such ingenuity, it leaves an impact. the set selections could have been better. the songs don't stand anywhere; but they were needed in the background. atul kulkarni has a small role with high-impact. there were a few flaws visible. atul kulkarni explaining konkan sharma that honesty should be tagged along with intelligence. there could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a preach. the meeting between thapar and his daughter doesn't call for acting. that scene looks very unprofessional.<br /><br />overall it is a must-watch movie with selective options before the pedophilia incident. that may spoil your mood.
