i still liked it though. warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero. what saves this movie is the set, the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script. i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action, or plot but i got very little. the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film. <br /><br />the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna. she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad. the movie at some points just stood still. you expected something more and you got nothing. al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good. he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy. <br /><br />it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman, and warren beatty in a film other than isthar. i did not see ishtar but i heard bad things. the thing about this movie is it is good, but it could have been so much better. i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool, and visually the movie is amazing, the sets are incredible, the writing is only fair, and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway. <br /><br />spoiler<br /><br />i especially thought the finale was not big enough. it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang. the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. the movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway.<br /><br />the costumes and makeup were flawless as well. the facial makeup for the villains was great. beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character. still, this is a good movie that could have been much much more. it is to me better than batman, the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time. of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross.
