a young ( only 21 ) director with great talent, a powerful scenario, young and ambitious cast with all theatrical background...<br /><br />one of the first tries of a thriller in turkish cinema, which seems in the future we'll have some more based on the success...<br /><br />shot on high definition video, the movie is perhaps effected on world thrillers, especially the american thrillers. the technical and cinematographic character is quite well done, the scenes are all well worked on. not too much blood but sufficient enough to make you think you're in a blood bath too...<br /><br />the scenario is quite wise but with certain clues, a clever audience can easily predict what's going on and at the end when everything settles down you're getting somehow weird to conclude the result.<br /><br />well done tiglon, one of the biggest dvd distributors in turkey, it is not easy to decide for such a movie in their first try as a production company...
