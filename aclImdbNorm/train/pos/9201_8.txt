dev anand (or prashant) and zeenat aman ( jasbir/janice) are siblings brought up in single parent families. jasbir (the sister) grows up in an affluent environment but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and ultimately join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs. prashant (the brother) on the other hand grows up in a less affluent environment but grows up to be a matured gentleman. the story marks prashant making efforts to save his little sister (who is perpetually in a trance) from a hostile hippie environment. this movie stands the test of time, commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should instead stand up and be counted in the face of adversity. great music compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and to different people, and the director brings forth an eerie feeling to it.
