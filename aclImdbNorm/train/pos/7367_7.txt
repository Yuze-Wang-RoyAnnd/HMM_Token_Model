i am currently doing film studies at a.s level and "this is not a love song" is a film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple storyline but a complex back-story. if you scratch the surface you will find a thriller-chase film of two men running through the countryside from farmers, after committing a murder:-"sounds quite exiting".<br /><br />however you need to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre. as it is suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, filled with trust, deceit and betrayal. we are not told about this "love" directly through the film but the events that happen through out, for example the way heaton acts towards spike almost screams this untouched love affair in our faces.<br /><br />overall this film is a good example of why british films should not be dismissed as "rubbish" just because they are done on a low budget.<br /><br />a good film with an intricate story line, however it is definitely an acquired taste and is possibly not suitable for the average fan of hollywood blockbusters.
