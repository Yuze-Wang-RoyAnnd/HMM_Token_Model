really...and incredible film that though isn't very popular...extremely touching and almost life altering...was for me at least.<br /><br />definitely worth seeing and buying .....added to my favorite movie list....it's number one now....<br /><br />this is a very touching movie that all people should see..<br /><br />the man in the moon.....we'll it's just incredible. it's now my favorite movie and i only saw it today and i'd recommend it to anyone above 15 as long as you're somewhat mature......if you don't really try to feel the characters emotions then you'll never get the true meaning and value of this movie....but it really is incredible....just watch it because it'll alter the way some people look at life....worth seeing 5/5
