i've just seen this movie for the second time on television. it's lovely, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. i've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -cybill shepherd, ryan o'neal, robert downey,jr. and especially mary stuart masterson simply outdo themselves. masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable. <br /><br />the movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as while you were sleeping, when harry met sally, sleepless in seattle and the "high gimmick" sorts of movies like big, back to the future, peggy sue got married. i hate to say this, because this cast was superb and i'd never change any of them- but i think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as meg ryan, tom hanks, michael j. fox, and kathleen turner at the time the movie was made.<br /><br /> it's not superbly written - e.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. yet it's executed to perfection. <br /><br />the romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the "feeling" of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are so touchingly delivered. again and again, you will find yourself moved. actually, a comparable movie is made in heaven -the same romantic yearning.<br /><br />do see this - it's lovely.
