this movie is a half-documentary...and it is pretty interesting....<br /><br />this is a good movie...based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan, norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germany.<br /><br />this movie isn't perfect and it could have been a bit better... the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves!!!<br /><br />if you're interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie that's worth a look!!
