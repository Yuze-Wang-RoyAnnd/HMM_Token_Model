it came by surprise. . .the impact & resoloution this film had on my automatic way of being reactive to people & situations. most vividly was the stirring of the emotion anger. much like the way a spoiled child would be when reacting to not getting their way. . .a temper tantrum if you will. thinking i was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. what was this costing me? soooo much love. . .sooo many blessings. now i'm present to how incredible humbling myself feels, and having an ongoing attitude of gratitude for life. . .for what is happening in the moment, without my wild expectations for life to be a particular way, the way i think life or people "should" be. this film has contributed to the freedom i now feel to connect with others, without limits & expectations. . .and to connect with genuine love. . .without fear of loss. . .just to love first, and accept what love is given.
