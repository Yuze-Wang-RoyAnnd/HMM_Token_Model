this is a great movie. some will disagree with me but , if you know anything about the bible you know it is. i think everyone should see it!! i agree a new updated version like be nice but the message is still right on. if you can see this movie. is not a "scare the hell of you movie",it is truthful with the bible. i think the u. n. will play a major role in the world government to come. the last days are lining up with the bible. look at what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that now has come to light to protect on children from being kidnapped. it's the size of a grain of rice. this i feel is the fore runner of the mark of the beast spoken of in the bible. without the mark you can't sell or buy, with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it.
