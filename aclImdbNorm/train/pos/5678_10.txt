we could still use black adder even today. imagine rowan atkinson resuming the role of assistant to the prime minister played by the wonderful hugh laurie. hugh is sensational as the dimwit prince george and edmund as his brilliant assistant. i love the episode which kenneth connor guest stars as a british thespian. every time, edmund says macbeth. the two thespians do a silly little act to ward off evil spirits. it's the funniest things that you will see. of course, none of this brilliance and comedic genius could be without ben elton and richard curtis who are also behind the films like love actually, the thin blue line, four weddings and a funeral. black adder is funny and almost too good for television. humor can be smart, sexy, and funny all at one. i was hoping last night on saturday night live that hugh laurie would pay homage to his background in british humor. if the gang at snl did some research, they would know what a treasure it was to have hugh laurie grace their stage.
