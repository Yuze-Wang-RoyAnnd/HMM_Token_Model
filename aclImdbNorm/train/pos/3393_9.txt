the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of hopelessness is on the beach. both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms. on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the environmental poisoning of the planet.<br /><br />maybe there's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now. new york city still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in soylent green. environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming. for myself it also shows the right to life ethic run amuck. obviously there's no family planning in this world either.<br /><br />charlton heston is an nypd detective who lives with room mate edward g. robinson who's old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck. there's been a murder committed, joseph cotten an executive with the soylent corporation, a multi-national concern that has come up with a food product, some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world's population. it's latest product is soylent green.<br /><br />the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man, but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind. as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people, that we've become a race of cannibals, the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative. we've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.<br /><br />this was the farewell performance of edward g. robinson and in his memoirs heston spoke movingly of robinson even though they had differing political views. a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia, he passed away in real life. not many did, but heston knew that robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them.<br /><br />though the timetable was off, it doesn't mean that the world envisioned by soylent green may not come to pass. hopefully we'll have not just the intelligence, but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening.
