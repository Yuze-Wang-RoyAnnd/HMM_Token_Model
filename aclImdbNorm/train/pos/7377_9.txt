this movie is practically impossible to describe. the alternate title "don't look up" is a lot more descriptive. like most japanese cinema, the story is not as linear as american. the story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a ww2 deserter. the set is haunted(?) by an actress who died(?) during the filming of a tv show back in the 60s. the director is the only one who saw this show. if you have seen ringu (the director hideo nakata is the same) and liked it, you'll like ghost actress. i loved ghost actress a lot more than ringu. a truly scary and disturbing movie. a 10!
