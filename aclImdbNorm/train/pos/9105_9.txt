women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in salazar's film piedras. although editor's cut here and there might help the film, it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense mark from pedro almodovar's latest films. 5 different women are coping with their male partners and families. beginning with several different stories bound to meet as the plot goes on, salazar portraits his women characters in the same neurotic and border-line behaviour familiar to almodovar. a kleptomaniac high society lady with a fattish to smaller shoes, a burlesque house madam taking care of her disabled daughter, a drug addict dancer obsessed with her former boyfriend and a taxi-driver taking care of her late husband's disturbed kids, all roaming the streets of madrid in well designed scenes. using some of almodovar's familiar actresses, the director succeeds in it's first film to give depth to all the characters sharing the film, and to create genuine sympathy with each of them. the women controls the plot line, and the men are bound to be left with each other, eventually... surprisingly good for a first film, and worth the time in any standard. it is noticeable that salazar hesitated in some needed guidelines to the actresses, but an impressible act is shown anyway on the screen, especially by monica cervera, which played in his former short film.<br /><br />a must to all almodovar's fans, and enjoyable to all.
