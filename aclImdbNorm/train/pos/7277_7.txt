this is a weird movie about an archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient hohokam indians. she takes a (really fake looking) mummy out of a burial cave and brings it home to study it. well, pretty soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy. and shortly thereafter her son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy. even stranger events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy the woman's family. this is actually really boring, overall, and it will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to watch it. but if you keep at it, you may just make it to the end. <br /><br />ahah! what is the secret of the mummy? is the mummy's spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave? you may not be able to ascertain what the spirit's motivation is, but if you like spooky shenanigans on a low-budget (and 70's hairstyles!) this will have a certain comforting appeal.<br /><br />the way i have described the story is much clearer than the jumbled, boring way the film lays the story out. can a boring movie really be fascinating? well...somehow this one achieves that. maybe this is a good movie at heart but executed in a rather awkward way. i don't know. what i do know is that i enjoyed it quite a bit, despite its dullness.<br /><br />fans of "spider baby" will be interested to know that a couple of music cues from that film are used in this one (including an instrumental version of the theme song).<br /><br />featuring one frightening and fairly well-done sequence showing possessed boulders and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper. other scenes in the movie are merely spooky or quirky; but this one scene is actually pretty scary.<br /><br />see this! it's weird and it's worth your time. you might even want one on your shelf.
