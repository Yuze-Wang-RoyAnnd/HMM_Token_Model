i have to agree with cal-37 it's a great movie, specially for the family, kelly linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and cute, of course jim belushi has earned his strips! but want i really liked was the piano song, if you're a musician or not watch this movie just for that, you'll know which it is.<br /><br />"you're nobody till somebody loves you" written by russ morgan, larry stock, and james cavanaugh<br /><br />so have fun watching<br /><br />see ya,<br /><br />nelson
