at first i was weirded out that a tv show's main character could bring the dead back to life, but then i thought i'd give it a shot. guess what? i love "pushing daisies" and look forward to wednesday nights just to watch it, then for the next week i watch it a few more times on my dvr. the colorful characters, witty banter, fast-paced dialogue, and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end. ned and chuck charles' relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact. even detective emerson cod's character has continued to grow in complexity. and olive snook! jiminy crispies! she cracks me up! the narrator's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that i am watching a movie instead of a tv show. i have recommended my family and friends to turn on "pushing daisies" and they are hooked too!!! the show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen "p.d.", i highly recommend watching it!
