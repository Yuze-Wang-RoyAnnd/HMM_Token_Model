i loved this film when i was little. today at 17 it is one of my all time favorite animated films. beautiful animation and appealing characters are just two of the things to like about this film. although many people might not enjoy some of the songs, most of them are well-done and go along with the story. it focuses on charlie, a roguish handsome german shepard who may seem unlikable to some at first... but eventually will win you over.<br /><br />not a kiddie film by any means. often very dark and frightening at times. a treat for don bluth fans and animation buffs. but do keep a tissue in handy. adgth never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are movie sensitive. arguably one of the greatest non-disney animated films of all time. along with watership down and my neighbor totoro.<br /><br />bottom line: a heavenly masterpiece.
