i remember this show as it became a regular viewing on a saturday evening.<br /><br />sabrina is a young girl who moves in with her aunts who as it turns out are witches and she is one to. so sabrina must learn how to control hr powers and use them effectively. she also must deal with school a vicious rival named libby, her ditsy best friend and boyfriend harvey kinkle...<br /><br />the show was funny and entertaining. it kept saturday evenings entertaining for a 10 year old boy..and made him laugh out loud...and flirt with 'libby'....
