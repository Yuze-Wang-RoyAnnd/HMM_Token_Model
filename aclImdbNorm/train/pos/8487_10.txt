i remember watching "gung ho" as a child with my mother, and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes. i, of course, found the entire movie hilarious, particularly the mannerisms of the characters. it wasn't until i was much older and watched it again that i realized how much deeper this show actually is.<br /><br />michael keaton and gedde watanabe shine in their roles as the reluctant mediators. keaton ceases to amaze me with his real-life style of line delivery, and watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. i also thought that patti yasutake (umeki) was simply fabulous in her role as the comic relief.<br /><br />i think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s. we can all learn a lesson from the merging of the american and japanese workers in this film...sometimes you really *can* have "the best of both worlds." and now i understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments. i'd rather have one of those cars, too.
