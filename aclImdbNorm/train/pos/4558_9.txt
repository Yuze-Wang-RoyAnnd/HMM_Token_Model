my left foot, in my opinion, is a great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and painters. the performances were smashing, the soundtrack was great, and the casting was perfect. i thought that christy (daniel day-lewis) was a very talented man, although i couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time. in addition, when he threw a tantrum, i got a little scared. also, it's just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. in conclusion, if you are a die-hard fan of daniel day-lewis or like biopics, i highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and painters. you're in for a real treat and a good time, so don't miss this one.
