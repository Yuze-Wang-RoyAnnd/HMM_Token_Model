monty berman and dennis spooner followed up 'the baron' with this, a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted 'the six million dollar man'. it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster, and i enjoy watching it still. stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett, while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready. the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne. by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson, terry nation and brian clemens, while spooner's own 'the interrogation' compared favourably with 'the prisoner'. i regret that there was never a second series; the concept had so much life left in it. would craig and richard have been competitors for sharron's affections? what if tremayne had learned of the champions' powers? did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw? we never found out, alas.
