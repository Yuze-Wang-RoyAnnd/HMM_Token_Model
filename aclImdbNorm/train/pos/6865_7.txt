with the current trend of gross out humor, this film is the granddaddy of them all. while some of the humor is dated, every skit will either shock, repulse, or make you laugh out loud. most memorable is the sex games commentary and, of course, the vd commercial. it doesn't always work, but pays off when it does. i give this a 7.
