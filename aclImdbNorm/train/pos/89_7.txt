to be honest, i had no idea what this movie was about when i started it. that's how i watch movies whenever possible. no preconception. i thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something. i was wrong, kinda.<br /><br />loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me. i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to do.<br /><br />another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ. these kinds of things do happen. i'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible". really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen. the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices. sometimes things turn out good, sometimes they turn out bad and such is life.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie.
