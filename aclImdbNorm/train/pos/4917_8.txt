'panic in the streets (1950)' owes more to british noir that its american counterparts. like reed's 'the third man (1949)' and dassin's 'night and the city (1950),' director elia kazan chose to film largely on location, capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the new orleans slums. in a decision borrowed from the masters of italian neorealism, he also hired many non-professional actors for minor roles, lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape. however, any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided, for 'panic in the streets' is pure melodrama, of the best kind. a murdered illegal immigrant, fished out of the bay, is found to be infected with pneumonic plague, a deadly air-borne mutation of bubonic plague, which is transmitted from human-to-human and, untreated, has a mortality rate that approaches 100%. clinton reed (richard widmark), an officer with the u.s. public health service, convinces the doubtful police-chief (paul douglas) to undertake a city-wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide, lest they also be infected with the illness.<br /><br />in my younger years, i found wolfgang petersen's 'outbreak (1995)' to be among the most horrifying movies i'd ever seen. that thriller, which owes plenty to 'panic in the streets' {working title: "outbreak"}, terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer
