ralph and mumford, misfits in their own land, get duped into being unwitting pawns of synanomess botch. twice upon a time is the story of them, the characters they meet, and their struggle to set things right. with a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business, this offbeat movie hits the mark.<br /><br />the animation process, while similar to that of the cut out "south park" style, is much smoother and far more three-dimensional. if i didn't know that the animation was this style, i would swear that is was traditional pen and ink. if you can watch this film in dolby surround or thx, please do! you won't really miss anything if you don't, but if you do, you will get much more out of the experience!
