one more of those brilliant young men who went all out and dared to make a teen romance film( can i actually call it that?- it would invoke the devil out of its fans)on a micro budget but packed with such taste, sensitiveness and maturity. peter sollett- you deserve more admiration and respect.thanks once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the "industry" that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet. one location,a handful of rich characters, low budget,good acting(and that too amateurs),decent lighting - worshippers of true indie cinema should watch more of this and stop watching...well...you know what.
