soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be. i found the film to have some of the sacarstic, cynical humour like that in paul verhoven's starship troopers. the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book atmosphere.<br /><br />one particular trivia-bit stands out for me - todd has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate. for the oblivious ones out there, tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy batty's elegiac last lines in blade runner. to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least. maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic?<br /><br />i'll give this one 3 out of 5.
