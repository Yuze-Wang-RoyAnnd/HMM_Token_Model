viewing "impulse" is a very satisfying experience. unpredictable films are such a rarity, when one comes along like "impulse", it is something to embrace. the script is logical, and extremely creative. meg tilly, tim matheson, hume cronyn, and bill paxton, give believable performances. this could have played out like a zombie movie, but "impulse" is far superior to any boring "zombiefest", and originality shines through in almost every scene. you get the feeling that something like this could have actually happened, even though the script is pure fiction. from the "grabber" opening till the credits roll, you will be fascinated. very entertaining and definitely recommended. - merk
