this film is exactly what its title describes--an attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offer.<br /><br />first, it's kinda fun to see the 1996-style toronto i remember with all its silly haircuts, sunglasses, clothes, and attitude. it really hasn't changed any; just a nice, safe, cheap, provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types! it's also amusing to see kenny and spenny head to l.a. and find out that it's toronto all over again, only with a strange assortment of beach bums, musicians, fortune tellers, and yet more uppity film types.<br /><br />i don't see pitch as a film to be enjoyed; it's not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone's aspirations being trampled. i take pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses. would-be (and "successful") writers, musicians, and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the big time.<br /><br />so, kenny and spenny are trying to sell you a warning. buy it or don't, but the message is still there.
