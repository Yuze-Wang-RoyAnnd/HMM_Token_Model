thomas ince always had a knack for bringing simple homespun stories to life with fullness and flair. "the italian" is such a film. solid acting, particularly by george beban, father of silent child actor george beban, jr., and wonderful sets convey a realistic feeling of early immigrant tenements in new york. these give this 1915 film an authenticity which is unusual in features of this vintage.<br /><br />the film begins with the modern day and a man (george beban in modern clothes) reading a story about an italian immigrant, and then we transition into the story with george playing the immigrant. he raises enough money to bring his fianc'ee from italy to america, marries her, and has a son with her. but times are hard and the family struggles to survive. i found myself wondering why the mother didn't breastfeed her child, and avoid the complications with the dirty formula, but oh well, even the early dream factory was pushing political correct behaviour for women in 1915!<br /><br />the best scene in the picture is when beban has a chance to seek revenge on a crime boss who inadvertently put him in jail, and at the last minute he decides against his planned course of action. very neat. i loved the curtain effect, it was great. wonderful use of lighting in this film.<br /><br />i give "the italian" an 8 out of 10.
