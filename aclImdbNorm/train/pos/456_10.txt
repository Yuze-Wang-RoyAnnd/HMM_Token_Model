this is a lovely, spirit-restoring movie. from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right! the quiet joy of this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings. josie lawrence, miranda richardson, polly walker and joan plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! i would dearly love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format.
