this is one irresistible great cheerful- and technically greatly made movie!<br /><br />the movie features some of the greatest looking sets you'll ever see in a '30's movie, even though it's all too obvious that they are sets, rather than real place locations. often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive, the entire set would obviously move.<br /><br />the best moments of the movie were the silent, more old fashioned, slapstick kind of moments. it shows that ren'e clair's true heart was at silent movie-making. the overall humor is really great in this movie. also of course the musical moments were more than great. this is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early french musical. though the best moments are the silent moments, that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog, that gets very well delivered by the main actors, who all seemed like stage actors to me, which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no-worries atmosphere. no wonder this worked out so well, since this movie is actually based on stage play by georges berr.<br /><br />it's a technical really great movie, with also some great innovation camera-work in it and some really great editing, that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences. there is never a dull moment in this movie!<br /><br />ren'e clair was such a clever director, who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies. it's a very creative made movie, that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie, that never seizes to entertain.<br /><br />the last half hour is especially unforgettably fun, without spoiling too much, and is really among the greatest, as well as most creative moments in early comedy film-making.<br /><br />the movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters, who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks. it all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and cuteness of the movie.<br /><br />one of the most pleasant movies you'll ever see!<br /><br />8/10
