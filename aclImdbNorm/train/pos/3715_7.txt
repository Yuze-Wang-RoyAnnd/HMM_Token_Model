alright this was quite a sensitive little number but i can't help thinking i've seen it before. reminds me of another vca film i saw at poitier called "the other days of ruby rae" also had specks of "welcome to the dollhouse" and "ratcatcher" and lynne ramsay in it's execution. which is not to say that they're not tasteful references...just that they feel very modern and very fashionable...which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come.<br /><br />the cinematography is just...too perfect for my liking. too coral filter (or charcoal) for my liking...too archly framed 12mm. therefore the entire impression left me a little distant -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily! the french (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to buy it as did the jury however... but cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it's feature selection although i wonder what's been happening in the last few years.
