<br /><br />i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old - i bugged my parents to take me back three times. i began looking for it on video about five years ago, finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site, but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased (i understand the original video run was small), or have the rights purchased by the family channel, disney, etc. and shown regularly. it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan, narrated by a wise old tree. the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well. it would be a good seller today, better than many of the weak offerings to children's movies today.
