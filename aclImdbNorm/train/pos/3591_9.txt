i never bothered to see this movie in theaters although i remember hearing the name over and over. i finally watched it this week and what a delight. for some reason, i was expecting it to not be very good so i was completely surprised when i sat down and stuck with it and then found myself completely pulled in. i read a lot of the other user comments and it impressed me how much people talk about her fighting in the ring, but what was wonderful about diana is that she's a true fighter in life. all she needs to do is find her place where she be who she is and the ring helps her to get there. a very intelligent story and i'm amazed that this is the first time up for michelle rodriguez - what an excellent job she did. adrian and her coach were also quite good.<br /><br />this film is a little rough around the edges, but it doesn't matter in the slightest. the story, the will, and the performances completely outweigh any flaws (that usually come with indie filmmaking anyway). a compelling portrayal of a girl finding herself and triumphing over her circumstances and a k.o. for michelle rodriguez!
