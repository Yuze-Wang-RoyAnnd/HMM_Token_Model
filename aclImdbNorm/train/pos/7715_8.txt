first off, consider that this film is nearly fifty years old! yet, it still stands up as one of the great films of all time. i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in 2050?<br /><br />the story is simple, yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. i can still recall the first time i watched this, as a kid, when the monster enters the force-field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first (and only) time. had me shivering in fear, i can tell you. looks dated today, but still more than effective enough.<br /><br />the scenes with the tiger show their age now. you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira, but they are only just visible.<br /><br />likewise, the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done.<br /><br />it's also amazing to see leslie nielsen (better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies) as a young, but still mature man. he was 30 when this film came out! nearly 80 now!<br /><br />all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come. timeless.
