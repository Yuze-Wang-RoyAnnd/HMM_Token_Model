i originally watched 8 simple rules on the disney channel uk for the first series and got completely hooked. when they didn't show it any more \ was annoyed, but then abc 1 satred showing the 2nd series. i didn't think another series would start after i read john ritter had died, however the 2nd series wasn't amazing the latest series is back to it's old excellent standard. i hope they go on to produce more shows soon even though i could watch each show a thousand times. kaley couco is my favourite character as airhead bridget and also performs amazing in charmed. rory is also good, he shares my name and grampa as well.i'll keep on watching it until it ends until then i hope it carries on as funny as ever
