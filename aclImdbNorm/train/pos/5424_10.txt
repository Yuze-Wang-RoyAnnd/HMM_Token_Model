"gunga din": one of the greatest adventure stories ever told! a story about the british foreign legion in 19th century india and a lowly "water-bearer" named gunga din, a local denizen who aspires to be just like his military counterparts; three british sergeants whose loyalty and camaraderie for each other extend far beyond the bounds of mere patriotism. their's is a true and abiding friendship for one another and each would be willing to sacrifice his own life for the good of the other. gunga din longs to be a soldier too, a bugler in particular, but can never attain that rank due to his subordinate social standing. however, heroes are not made according to their social credentials, they're made through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others. gunga din tries at every turn to prove his mettle, but will he ever attain the rank he so passionately seeks?...."you're a better man than i am, gunga din"! one of hollywood's classics and a perfect 10!!!!
