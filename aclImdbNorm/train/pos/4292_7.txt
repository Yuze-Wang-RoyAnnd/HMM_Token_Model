didn't know anything about the movie before watching and i think it was the "no expectation" factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than i anticipated.<br /><br />the setting was interesting, strange but interesting. the storyline had gaps/jumps that i think throws the audience off a bit. there's no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating the "romantic" ambiance. but they all didn't matter.<br /><br />the chemistry between emma and luis was simply exquisite. there was some inexplicable strange chemistry that i couldn't resist; i fell in love with it and here i am, writing this review. the subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb, and i believe, that is the core of this movie.<br /><br />this movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. i had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things i didn't catch at first. i cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but i hope you do.
