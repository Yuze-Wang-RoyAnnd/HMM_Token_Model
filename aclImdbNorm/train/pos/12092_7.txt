i first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television. scared the hell out of me. but then, i was a teenager back in those days, not as jaded about films as i am now.<br /><br />castle of blood (aka: danse macabre) is a fine example of the 60s italian horror genre, along with mario bava's black sunday(1960), curse of the living dead (aka: kill baby kill) (1966) and mario caiano's nightmare castle (1965). if you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing, then check these out as well. i also rate these along with those early poe films that roger corman was doing during the same period.<br /><br />i saw the new synapse dvd that was taken from a french print and it's a great improvement over that old pan-and-scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years. it adds a couple of minutes of dialog (in french) that don't really add much to the movie as whole, but it's nice to see it complete, without cuts. unfortunately the dvd doesn't really offer any extras beyond stills from the film.<br /><br />one flub i noticed was in the opening scene, seeing the smoke-effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn's front door. i guess the editors didn't catch it at the time, or maybe they didn't care, but it is something i didn't notice the first time. that's the wonders of dvd. you get to see all the flubs, mistakes and details that weren't apparent the first time around. but no matter.<br /><br />but no matter, it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter<br /><br />
