i began watching a replay of this tv movie on a sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick. i was wrong.<br /><br />"pandora's clock" is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most tv movies. it could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen.<br /><br />the cast is excellent, including veteran actors richard dean anderson, edward herrmann, robert guillaume, and robert loggia. daphne zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the cia, and frasier's jane leeves is also very good. <br /><br />the dialogue is well-written and the story is compelling throughout. in fact, the final hour is so filled with plot twists and suspense that you can't leave your seat for a second. if you get a chance to see this movie, invest the time -- nearly four hours. you will be richly rewarded!
