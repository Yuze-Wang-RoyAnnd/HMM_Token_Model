i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it. i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released. in all 42 episodes so far, the best one is definitely episode #3, denial, anger, acceptance. this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos. his name was brendan filone. he was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang. in the end, he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath, and that's my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos. brendan filone is # 1 for me. and my # 2 most favorite character ever was matthew bevilaqua, who was killed after attempting to murder christopher moltisanti. tony and pussy shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him. my # 3 most favorite character is sean gismonte, who was killed right after shooting christopher. and finally, my # 4 most favorite character is chucky signore, one of uncle junior's henchmen. he was killed on a boat by tony. all the awesome characters are dead. that's the only bad thing about the sopranos. all the cool guys always get killed. you know what would be great to change about the sopranos? they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris, tony, uncle junior, silvio, and paulie, because they need to get their revenge. brendan filone shall strike back!!!!!!!!!1
