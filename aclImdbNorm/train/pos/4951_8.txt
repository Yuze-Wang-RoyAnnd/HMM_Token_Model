in all honesty, if someone told me the director of lemony snicket's series of unfortunate events, city of angels, and caspers was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and that'd it be real good, i'd say that person must be joking. but that's what director brad siberling did. and it was really good.<br /><br />"10 items or less" has a similar conceit to films like "before sunrise," "lost in translation," or more recently "once." it involves the chance meeting of two people who if serendipity didn't put them there, they'd probably never cross paths, or if they did, they wouldn't say word one to each other. like those films, "10 items or less" focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each other's strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />the story involves morgan freeman, playing an unnamed actor who goes to research his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control, ends up spending the day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane played by paz vega. she has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary. initially, freeman's character just needs a lift home. after spending time with her, however, he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advice.<br /><br />brad siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between freeman and vega. the plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the film's 80 minute duration. freeman has fun with his character, as he appears an outsider in lower class world that vega's character, scarlett, inhabits. vega, in the meantime, grows beyond the stubborn checkout clerk upset with her life's situation looking to move on.<br /><br />there a couple things that really stood out in this film. first of all, siberling has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and doesn't fall into any hollywood pitfalls. it's a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film. it works, even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivable.<br /><br />i am also impressed with the performances. while freeman's presence gives this film credibility from the get-go, he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him. paz vega, meanwhile, is priming herself for a breakthrough in us film sometime in the future. i loved her in spanglish and she's equally good here as the tough, no-nonsense scarlet. towards the end of the film, she successfully conveys the growth of her character. i'm looking forward to seeing her in more films.<br /><br />overall, 10 items of less functions best as a character piece, well scripted and directed by brad siberling. he hasn't done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big hollywood films. yet there's certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if he'll take this road again.
