what a fun filled, sexy movie! they certainly don't make them like this anymore. 4 sexy au pairs arrive in london and have all sorts of sexual misadventures. the tone is oddly innocent, as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations, rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters. it is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant. richard o' sullivan literally gets 'randi'(sic). the film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school. my special interest in 'au pair girls' is that i am a huge fan of gabrielle drake. if any actress has ever looked better naked (she's slim but wonderfully curvy), or clothed, come to that (i've loved her since the original run of ufo - who else could carry off a purple wig!), i'll eat my hat.
