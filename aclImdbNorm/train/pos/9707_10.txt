about a year ago i finally gave up on american television. i thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in england showed me some programs that included the office, extras, blackadder, and the league of gentlemen. it was then that i decided to switch to british television. among all the shows listed above, the league of gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all, providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy i've seen yet. characters included are the most unhappily married couple, a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go unsaid (probably for the best), a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only caters to local people, and the worst veterinarian ever. this program is one of the best i've seen.
