these slasher pics are past their sell by date, but this one is good fun.<br /><br />the valentine cards themselves are witty, and well thought out.<br /><br />the film has one peach of a line... "he's no angel...." when he in fact is angel!!! watching buffy reruns will never be the same!<br /><br />the cast is a sizzling display of young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters. sorry but no!<br /><br />the direction is very good, managing to show very little actual gore, and relying on your imaginations implied threat. much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes...:-(<br /><br />essentially, the main directorial plus, lies within the "borrowing" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks. psycho's shower scene is tributed, along with halloween's "masking". <br /><br />murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know!!!<br /><br />light viewing, not very scary but a few good jump moments. if it was a choice between the hole and this though, choose the hole. slasher movies have had their day, and this is just another slasher. a very good slasher, but nothing groundbreaking!!!
