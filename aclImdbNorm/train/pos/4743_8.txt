this is a very strange hk film in many ways. first, many of the action sequences really aren't that much fun. the very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly. not cool silly, or even funny silly, but just silly. that's not to say there aren't some great action scenes, but most simply don't come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen. the opposite side is that this film actually has characters, not just people. all of the main characters are interesting (except for the head bad guy, who is flat as a billiard table) and most are fairly well acted. all the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch. the dialogue is quite witty, and doesn't seem to lose much in translation. this film is worth seeing, but i hope that uninitiated american audiences don't think this is the best hk has to offer.
