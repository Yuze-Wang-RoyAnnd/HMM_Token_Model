if you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss, first boy/girlfriend, or first puppy love fling...this film is for you! ok so this movie would and will never win an oscar but as a dominican i loved it...there are some things in the movie that might just go right over your head if you are not part of the culture...the kids being raised by a grandma who's both mother and father, the youngest son being babied and bathed with a cafe bustelo tin (sooo dominican!), judy being harassed by the neighborhood men, going to church and lighting a prayer candle...the film's brilliance was in those small details. granted, it was not a pull out all the works cinematic extravaganza but it wasn't meant to be nor was it meant to be an educational tool for those wanting to learn about latin culture ( tip: make new friends instead). more of a bitter-sweet, faux-cumentery, this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously. as in the tradition of "y tu mama tambien" this was simply one boy's coming of age tale. i recommend it (especialmente si eres dominicano!) =o)
