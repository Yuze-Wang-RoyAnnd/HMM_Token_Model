13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint. the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively, the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith (davy crocket) and lorne greene (sam houston) were too old.<br /><br />raul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle. the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand. failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military. santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry. raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene.<br /><br />kathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. however, kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron.
