this is obviously aimed at the same market as monsters inc and shrek, but is different in its less cartoony feel (despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures). the story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end (its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves) but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different "animals." you know the outcome, but you can't help being drawn in.<br /><br /> the characters themselves are far more than their voices (the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices), unlike most disney movies. they are well rounded and completely believable, strangely. the group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable. you will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think.<br /><br /> the animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie. you will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts. i came out wanting the obligatory merchandise, especially the sloth toy, only to be disappointed the next day when i couldn't find anything vaguely related.<br /><br />which, strangely, makes the movie all the more pure.<br /><br /> better than monsters inc or shrek.
