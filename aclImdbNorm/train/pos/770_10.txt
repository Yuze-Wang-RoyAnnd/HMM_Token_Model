i love tudor chirila and maybe that's why i enjoyed the movie so much. two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert. i saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie and i thought i had it all figured.. i was wrong: instead of a good movie i assisted a great one! i felt the movie. it was sad.. it was funny.. but most of all it pictured love.. i can't even begin to describe the soundtrack.. so i won't :) i'm not a movie critic.. i can't describe it in more words.. my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless.. thank god for the keyboard :) thank you tudor giurgiu, thank you maria popistasu, thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila. encore! :)
