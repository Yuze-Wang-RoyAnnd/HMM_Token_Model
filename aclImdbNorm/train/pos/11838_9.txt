this is one of the most calming, relaxing, and beautifully made animation films i've ever seen. with beautiful music throughout the movie, the sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! this movie is not just great for kids, but adults too. it teaches you lessons, such as never forget who you are, you can do whatever you stick your mind to, and to brave and daring. this movie can make you cry at times too, which is always a nice touch in movies. this movie is funny, sad, cute, and keeps you on the edge of your seat! some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them, and the movie "spirit" is definitely one of them! with my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music, and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a whole lot of spirit!
