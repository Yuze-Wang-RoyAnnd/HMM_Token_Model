i'm giving it only 9 out of 10, because i need to view it again, in a more current mind-frame to have a fresh perspective. what i remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when i watched it. i would watch it every time it came on hbo back in the day (probably 1990 or so). i might have even recorded it, but that recording is long gone, i'm sure.<br /><br />i wrote to greencine to try and get this title in, they currently don't carry it. i hope i can find it at a local video store.<br /><br />i would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere. it's interesting at the very least. if you enjoyed movies such as edward scissorhands, beetlejuice, gummo, or anything sort of strange and along those lines, try this one out.
