i love this film 'spring and port wine'. i was born in leigh, a town about 7 miles away from bolton, i moved to bolton in 1965 when i was 20. my place of work was daily via little lever through farnworth, sometimes on a bike but then by car when i could afford it.the film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you if they could. fred dibnah was round the corner from bromwich st. were my bedsit was. if you didn't see the film when first released then you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap such as coronation st, well i agree it is a soap, but then, it was called 'kitchen sink drama!' watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on tv, i watch mainly for the shots of the locality and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy!
