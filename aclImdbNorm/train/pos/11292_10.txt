i saw this movie once as a kid on the late-late show and fell in love with it.<br /><br />it took 30+ years, but i recently did find it on dvd - it wasn't cheap, either - in a catalog that specialized in war movies. we watched it last night for the first time. the audio was good, however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels. even so, it was better than i remembered it. i was also impressed at how true it was to the play.<br /><br />the catalog is around here someplace. if you're sincere in finding it, fire me a missive and i'll see if i can get you the info. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
