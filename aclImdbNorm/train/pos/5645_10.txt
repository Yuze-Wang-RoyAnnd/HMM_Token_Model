i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from amazon.com based on my other interests. they hit the nail on the head with this one. i remember watching the show when it was on tv but always wondered what happened to it. ten years later, it's like watching it all again for the first time. lucas black as caleb temple and gary cole as sheriff lucas buck are great together, even though they are somewhat rivals. almost representing good (caleb) and evil (sherriff lucas buck). i never really understood exactly what lucas was supposed to be, but let it suffice to say, he has some special powers that i don't believe were granted by anything holy. he can make phones ring, writing appear, or even cause a person's emotions to change. none the less, there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all. all in all, this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of, (i.e. point pleasant, threshold, nowhere man, and seaquest dsv just to name a few) were cancelled way before their time. the steven king's the dead zone ( sunday's usa network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it. there is just nothing fit to watch on tv anymore. this is because anything that deals with christianity and satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from tv. so, in the meantime, i'll just keep buying dvd sets and watching shows that should still be on tv but were booted off tv by religious zealots so we could watch "quality" shows like family guy and american dad and the simpsons (what a bunch of crap that is).
