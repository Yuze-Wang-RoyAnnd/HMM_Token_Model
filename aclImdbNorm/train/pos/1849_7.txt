"antwone fisher" tells of a young black u.s. navy enlisted man and product of childhood abuse and neglect (luke) whose hostility toward others gets him a stint with the base shrink (washington) leading to introspection, self appraisal, and a return to his roots. pat, sanitized, and sentimental, "antwone fisher" is a solid feel-good flick about the reconciliation of past regrets and closure. good old hollywood style entertainment family values entertainment with just a hint of corn.
