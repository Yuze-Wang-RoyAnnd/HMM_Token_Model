when i was a kid i watched this many times over, and i remember whistling the "happy cat" song quite often. all the songs are great, and actually memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason. the scenes and costumes are lavish, and the acting is very well-done, which isn't surprising, considering the cast. christopher walken is very catlike, and doesn't need stupid make-up, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human. and jason connery's so cute, as the shy and awkward miller's son, corin, who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera. this is a really fun, enjoyable, feature-length movie, where unlike most fairytales, the characters are given personalities. some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend he's drowning; at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance, as it's "all the rage abroad"; when walken is in the kitchen, dancing on the table (he's a pretty good dancer, too!); and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young, like pretending she was a miller's daughter. i'd recommend this film to children and parents alike, who love magic and fairytales. and it actually is a movie you can watch together, as it won't drive adults up the wall.
