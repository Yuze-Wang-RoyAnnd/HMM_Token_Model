the film starts out very slowly, with the lifestyle of wallace napalm, an attendant at a photo-service drop-off station. his wife has been restricted to her home with an ankle bracelet as the result of a sentence for arson. wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department, and takes firefighting seriously.<br /><br />as we watch wallace's rather dull life proceeding, suddenly there comes something new and jarring: a traveling carnival comes to town. one of its stars is wilder napalm, wallace's brother. he's a clown, but he has a special talent.<br /><br />so does wallace. they're both pyrokineticists or "pyrotics," people capable of starting fires through mental energy. wallace keeps his powers secret; wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do.<br /><br />spoiler: some of their differences go back to a childhood incident where they inadvertently caused the death of a vagrant. wallace holds back from using his powers; wilder wants to go public on national tv.<br /><br />complicating the matter, wilder wants wallace's wife, whom they both dated years earlier. she becomes a bone of contention, and becomes one of the reason that the brothers finally have a literal firefight.<br /><br />the film is entertaining, but not laugh-out-loud funny. i think enough of it to have a copy in my library. it's a good offbeat film.
