artistically speaking, this is a beautiful movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are gorgeous. in fact, this movie is prettier than those directed by akira kurasawa himself. in this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />so, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was well-written and the story, at times, was interesting. however, the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. it's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in japan, the women still long for a better life. this reminds me a lot of the movie streets of shame, though streets of shame's characters are a lot less likable and more one-dimensional.<br /><br />so, overall it gets a 7--mostly due to everything but the writing. it's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great kurasawa.
