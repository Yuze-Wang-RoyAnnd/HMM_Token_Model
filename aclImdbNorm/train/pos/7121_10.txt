i hadn't seen this film in probably 35 years, so when i recently noticed that it was going to be on television (cable) again for the first time in a very long time (it is not available on video), i made sure i didn't miss it. and unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again, i found the visual images from the "pride of the marines" were as vivid and effective as i first remembered. what makes this movie so special, anyway?<br /><br />everything. based on the true story of al schmid and his fellow marine machine gun crew's ordeal at the battle of the tenaru river on guadalcanal in november, 1942, the screenplay stays 95% true to the book upon which it was based, "al schmid, marine" by roger butterfield, varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture. this is not a typical "war movie" where the action is central, and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film. but it is a memorable 10 minutes, filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle, and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre. in a way probably ahead of its time, the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark, ugly, brutal nature of battle, and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war. this film isn't about "glorifying" war; i can't imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and wanting to enlist in the service. not right away, anyway.<br /><br />what this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle, and how damaged men can learn to re-claim their lives. there's an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this, and i feel that's another reason why the film was so so well received--it was exceptionally well-written. there's a "dream" sequence done in inverse (negative film) that seems almost experimental, and the acting is strong, too, led by john garfield. garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and schmid's were nearly the same, and garfield met schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role. actors don't do that much anymore, but added to the equation, it's just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult, unattractive story.
