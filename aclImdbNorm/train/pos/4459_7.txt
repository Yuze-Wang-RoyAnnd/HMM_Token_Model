for such films like `anchors aweigh', few have been bestowed with as many academy award accolades in a warm up for happy hour. either 1945 was a beleaguered year for good film or they were still suffering advance shock by billy wilder's `the lost weekend' that they wrote anything starting with a on the ballot for best picture to please the still musical picture faithful public. since gene kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in `singin' in the rain', then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes rigging systems at mgm. of course, the studio is on its best behaviour during this much lauded tour of the great studios and of hollywood itself, handy for those stuck on the other side of the world.<br /><br />yet a sailor suit musical with the brilliant talents of gene and frank sinatra is certainly an enjoyable farce, despite the need for more people to yawn at the previews for the musical so today's audiences wouldn't be slapped with an unnecessary runtime. there have been many longer pieces before and since, but in this case all of the charming kathryn grayson's scenes could have been eliminated. until the viewing of `kiss me kate' it may have been necessary non-opera enthusiasts to watch any of her films with remote control in hand. <br /><br />if there was a need to practice picking up women for 1949's `on the town', then perhaps the shore leave lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with jose iturbi and strike up the piano for a whole hearted `susie' rendition. few are lucky to get a screen test at the golden studios of mgm. then few are even luckier to be attended to. there are no regrets to be had about the successful screen tests of susan abbot or kathryn grayson, but it makes the continual non-opera enthusiast hope for the eventual pink slip to be handed out to both. <br /><br />but for all, the star talents are good shape and an above average score thrown in with a slight, but fun great navy story intertwined with young ambitious navy boys good for late bursts of wartime morale, makes `anchors' at least doesn't question picking the wrong mgm film. the direction holds up as the cast carries the story in lovely colour cinematography. whenever anyone bursts into music or song, the film makes for a joyous occasion.<br /><br />the natural highlight of the film is gene kelly's cartoon adventures in a fantasyland, climaxing in a brilliant dance with jerry the mouse. this is a well-deserved masterpiece number of kelly's career, and it's nice to know he thought of it before fred astaire started taking to dancing on walls and ceilings.<br /><br />it's not exactly sitting down to a triple flavour, rainbow sprinkled, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana split sundae, but it is a square solid lump of sugar that somehow eventually melts in your mouth and despite the guilt, is still a pleasant feeling.<br /><br />rating: 7/10
