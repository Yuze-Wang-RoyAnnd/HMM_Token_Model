i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night, not knowing what to expect. i had heard of this movie, but never really any opinions on it.<br /><br />i have to say, i was impressed with what i saw. i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times.<br /><br />the blob was scary looking. now, i look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it'll latch itself onto my hand.<br /><br />steve mcqueen was really good as steve andrews, the protagonist of the film. i also liked the old man in the beginning.<br /><br />for a 50's horror movie, this was very well done even by today's standards.<br /><br />8/10.
