henry fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed abraham lincoln was like. it is a fooler. through fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that abraham lincoln was a country bumpkin. but, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /><br />in this movie henry fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor. it is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. when he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect. there is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard. he shows this gift again in the lady eve in 1940.<br /><br />the ending by john ford is absolutely brilliant with henry fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the civil war. he goes forward into history. the movie is fiction but the insight into lincoln is tremendous. definitely worth seeing again.
