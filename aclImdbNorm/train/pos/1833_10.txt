the basic storyline here is, aditiya (kumar) is the spoilt son of a millionaire, ishwar (bachan) who owns a toy industry, in ishwar's eyes his son aditya can do nothing wrong, aditya's mother sumitra (shefali shah) warns ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late, for ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live, when his son elopes and marries mitali (chopra), ishwar readily forgives aditya, but when the happy couple aditya and mitali come back from a honeymoon, mitali is pregnant, and this forces ishwar to kick aditya out of the house to make him more responsible, aditya doesn't know his father is suffering from lung cancer, and he also doesn't know that his father has kicked him out of the hose to make him more responsible, ishwar cannot bring himself to tall aditya that he is about to die, with a hungry and pregnant wife. it is a race against time so aditya does all he can to prove himself to his father, and the climax comes when aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die.<br /><br />this movie is absolutely brilliant, this is the breakthrough in indian cinema that was needed for the bollywood industry, shah's directing is almost flawless, but which movie doesn't have flaws? the best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a tearjerker. the song interludes is just placed at the right time, the scenery is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between boman irani and rajpal yadav the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying, but overall this is a brilliant movie, i advise anybody reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews. 9/10
