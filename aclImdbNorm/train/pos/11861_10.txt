this movie is very entertaining and is never ever boring even running at nearly 3 hours. al pacino, michelle phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very believable. the violence was a little extreme in the film but then it showed how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film. the ending is amazing and is probalby one of the coolest scenes ever. great movie and you will probably really enjoy it.
