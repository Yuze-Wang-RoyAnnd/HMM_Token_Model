i just have to throw my two cents in. relax, it's a comedy. yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted. i can't think of many comedies where they aren't. this isn't a new release, it's out on video and airs on cable almost every week. would i see it in a theater? sure, i did, when it first came out. it's funny...that should be enough.<br /><br />even if i didn't like it at all i'd still watch it on cable for michael keaton. he's an underrated and under-appreciated actor. i can't think of another who is so capable in every genre. nor can i think of one who's as successful. a comedic actor who's also an action star(short lived but still), who's also a romantic lead, who's also a dramatic actor; a villain and a hero. i can't think of any, at least not in hollywood. certainly none who have been successful at all those genres. i mean there's tom cruise but to me he's better at being tom cruise than becoming a character. however this isn't about michael keaton vs. tom cruise so i'll move on.<br /><br />gung ho is worth renting, heck it's worth buying since you can probably find it for $10.00 or less at stores like wal-mart. it's worth watching on cable(if you have cable or satellite). it's one of those fun to watch movies. you can put your brain on pause, and just relax, and chuckle away.<br /><br />to ask for more, in my honest opinion, is asking too much.
