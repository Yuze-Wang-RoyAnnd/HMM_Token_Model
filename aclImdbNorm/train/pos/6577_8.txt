with few exceptions, most of george bernard shaw's plays have virtually disappeared from the theater these days. too arch, too talky appears to be the general verdict. this bbc version of one of shaw's funniest plays doesn't refute that verdict. it is certainly arch and talky, but it is also wonderful. and because of the quality of british theater, it is perfectly cast with actors whom -- with the exception of helena bonham carter -- most of us have probably never heard of. carter is splendid as the bulgarian girl who shelters the professional "chocolate soldier" (pip torrens) and later falls in love with him. one might quarrel with the especially ridiculous interpretation of sergius (patrick ryecart), the bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge into the enemy's lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for its machine guns. however, the role invites over-acting and ryecart was obviously told to over-act. the other players are letter perfect. carter as the self-dramatizing bulgarian "aristocrat" and torrens as the swiss soldier-of-fortune are at the play's center, of course, and they are wonderful. yes, "arms and the man" comes across as a filmed play. but you're unlikely ever to see a shaw film that doesn't betray its origin. the plots are generally clever. however, shaw is all about the dialog. the action is minimal (even in st. joan) and the sets are immaterial. enjoy this for what it is.
