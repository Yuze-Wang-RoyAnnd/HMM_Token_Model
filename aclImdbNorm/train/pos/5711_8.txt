in le million, rene clair, one of the cinema's great directors and great pioneers, created a gem of light comedy which for all its lightness is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film which clearly influenced subsequent film-makers such as the marx brothers, lubitsch, and mamoulian. the plot, a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot but has to search frantically all over town for the missing ticket, is basically just a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comic scenes enacted in a dream world of the director's imagination.<br /><br />one of the most impressive things about this film is that, though it is set in the middle of paris and includes nothing actually impossible, it achieves a sustained and involving fairy-tale/fantasy atmosphere, in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they talk, or that a tussle over a stolen jacket should take on the form of a football game. another memorable element is that le million includes what may be the funniest opera ever put on film (o that blonde-braided soprano! "i laugh, ha! ha!") also a delight is the casting: clair has assembled a group of amazing, sharply different character actors, each of them illustrating with deadly satiric accuracy a bourgeois french "type," so that the film seems like a set of daumier prints come to life.<br /><br />the hilarity takes a little while to get rolling, and i found the characters not as emotionally engaging as they can be even in a light comedy (as they are, for instance, in many lubitsch films.) for these reasons i refrained from giving it the highest rating. but these minor cavils shouldn't distract from an enthusiastic recommendation.<br /><br />should you see it? by all means. highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy.
