billy wilder is co-credited for the story, and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burnt-out music legend oliver courtney. the obvious misunderstandings are gotten out of the way quite quickly, thank heaven, and what remains is a witty and breezy concoction with some fine songs (and some more forgettable ones), crosby at his most charming, a great turn by broadway legend mary martin and basil rathbone and oscar levant providing most of the cynical barbs (levant is in rare form and his quips haven't dated at all). a delightful surprise, and recommended for all fans of the genre.
