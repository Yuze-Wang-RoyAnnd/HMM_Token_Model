while this movie's style isn't as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been, this is still a very good film. in fact, it was seen as an excellent film in its day, as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar (losing to wings). i still consider wings to be a superior film, but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead, emil jannings.<br /><br />jannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a hollywood extra. his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call--to play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution. naturally this isn't much of a stretch acting-wise, but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution.<br /><br />exactly what happens next i'll leave to you, but it's a pretty good film--particularly at the end. by the way, look for william powell as the russian director. despite being made in 1928, with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films.
