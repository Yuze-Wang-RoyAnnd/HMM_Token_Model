i was an usherette in an old theater in northern california when this movie came out. as good as it is on dvd, it's even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen. although it has been about 9 years since i have seen it, it is still one of my all-time favorites. at the risk of sounding trite, "they just don't make 'em like this anymore!" if sixth sense freaked you out at all, this movie is definitely for you! great storyline, incredible cast of characters, ominous setting; even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it. i highly recommend you not watch it alone. what a brownstone apartment was renting for in 1977 alone, will have you gasping (it would be at least 10-times that price today).
