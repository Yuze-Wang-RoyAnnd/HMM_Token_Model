although dig! was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated. the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post-'98. and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked. the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film.<br /><br />that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art. one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene.<br /><br />recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands.
