the problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good, but still not work if the audience doesn't believe that the actor is portraying the person. that's the main issue with "young mr. lincoln:" henry fonda gives a terrific performance, but i found it hard to believe that abraham lincoln was as soft-spoken as fonda portrays him.<br /><br />this is essentially a courtroom drama with a young abraham licoln at the forefront. whether or not this was a true story, i don't know, but if it isn't, then why tell it using lincoln as the central character? never mind though. in the film, lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder.<br /><br />there's really not much to the film, and as a result, it seems rather empty. i wanted more story and character development. the film is 100 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. there are some little scenes featuring lincoln and the blooming relationship with mary todd, but they seem superficial.<br /><br />the acting is good all around, but as i said, fonda's performance works as a character, but not abraham lincoln. i just don't believe that the real lincoln was that soft-spoken. true, he has a big voice when he needs to, such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial, but fonda portrays lincoln too meekly. the other performances are solid though, especially alice brady as abigail clay, the mother of the accused. she's a nice lady who we can really feel for. simple and uneducated, yet very sweet; we can see why lincoln wanted to help her.<br /><br />john ford seems to think of this film as an epic, and at the time of its release, it probably was. but even then, there's just not enough material to present it as such.<br /><br />it's a nice watch, but not a classic.
