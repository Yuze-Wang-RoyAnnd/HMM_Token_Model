i had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at imdb and that's why i had avoided it. today they showed vanilla sky on tv and as i had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, i would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. vanilla sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best i've seen in a while. i was surprised by how i was affected watching it. it's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. vanilla sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.<br /><br />i really recommend everyone to watch this movie. regardless of what you have heard about it.
