another one for the babes & bullets crowd. the story is much edgier than any other musical i have seen: cannons hidden up the missing legs of females, and places each generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale. more effective than contemporary 'drama.' it is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants -- in lue of leggage. pretty remarkable if you consider the context.<br /><br />despite the cannon up the leg thing providing 90% of the surprises, this film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a group of yakuzas who pursue a woman who keeps up her leg a concealed cannon/rocket-launcher (hence no group shower scenes or thongs) the hidden projectile-launcher which is pulled out from the behind the protagonists back, seemingly from nowhere, in miike's dead or alive (1999), the torch brought forth out of thin air by the heroine towards the end of the original tomie (2000), or the harrowing flame-thrower scene in sunny gets blue (1992), all testify to an almost third-world cantinflas-esquire influence in the contemporary japanese cinema, of which i am at a loss to explain, but cannot complain.<br /><br />you won't see good quality movies of this essence made in hollywood, its all but extinct and with cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill, is all but laughable. this is a true film and while its great in its entirety, the ending is a brilliant, if not unblatant rip-off of certain sergio leon pictures, involving cannons where legs should be, and certainly is appropriate!
