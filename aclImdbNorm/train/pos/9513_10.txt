a great gangster film.sam mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son camaraderie.brilliant star-cast leading with tom hanks(michael sullivan) has done a terrific job.great acting by him again.he is an acting legend.great acting too from paul newman,jude law and daniel craig.casting is just too good.the plot is quite good.you will enjoy the movie.a great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's.set in the 1930's,this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era.soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie.a great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son.way underrated for my liking.deserved a fully deserved 10.
