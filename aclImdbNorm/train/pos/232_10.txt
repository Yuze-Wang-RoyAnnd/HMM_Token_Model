what a delightful movie. the characters were not only lively but alive, mirroring real every day life and strife within a family. each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends.<br /><br />the story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama, the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops. the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions, actions and reactions of the characters to conflict, opinion, and resolve.<br /><br />not an epic, but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones. plenty of knowing head nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy.
