i'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. however, pushing daisies is my exception. i became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. i was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of six feet under was still in my head. here we go again, i thought. i watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. wow! first of all, i thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid. the characters were engaging and i like the thought of ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, chuck without the consequences of her dying.<br /><br />most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. besides ned and chuck, olive longs for ned. lily and vivian longs for their niece chuck and emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. i think the characters are picture perfect and believable. i like how emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an african american; i like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him.<br /><br />all in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that i've seen out of the 2007 season. i think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. i just wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can continue to evolve.
