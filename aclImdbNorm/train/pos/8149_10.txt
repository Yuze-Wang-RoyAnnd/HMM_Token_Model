i first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is still funny. i don't know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90's, but it helps if you do. in the 90's when nwa and public enemy were at the top, there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways (ice cube, easy e, etc). also there were the wanna b's, accessible rappers that start making the scene (vanilla ice, freedom williams from c&c music factory, etc). this movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like it's an actually documentary. kasi lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name n.w.h. the members of the group are ice code (rusty condieff/director), tasty taste (larry b scott/revenge of the nerds, and tone def (mark christopher lawrence). they are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial. whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it. but, if you know 80's/90's rap, you know how much of this stuff is true. still, on it's own, without hip hop knowledge, it is still a funny funny movie. and for all of those who ask, yes spinal tap came first, but spinal tap is not the first spoof movie either. this, in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways, better than spinal tap. as spinal tap is to heavy metal, fear of a black planet is to rap. and the songs are off the hook also. the dvd is chalk full of extras to include music videos of nwh as a group and as solo artists. brilliant performances by rusty condieff and larry b scott.
