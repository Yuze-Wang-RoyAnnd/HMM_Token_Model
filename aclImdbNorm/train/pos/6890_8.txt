this was one of the highlights of st:tng's semi-forgettable second season, before they 'grew up' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond. this was not only a showcase for up-and-comers like bill campbell and teri hatcher, but was also the continuation of data's search for his 'humanity', this time through the concept of comedy. still one of my favorite episodes.<br /><br />on a side-note, i'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character okona was about to have a tryst(after teri hatcher's character) before being rudely interrupted by lt worf. i remember watching this episode 'first-run' at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would've been a perfect jean grey/marvel girl.<br /><br />it would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is...
