it's very funny. it has a great cast who each give great performances. especially sally field and kevin kline. it's a well written screenplay by andrew bergman (honeymoon in vegas). i don't like soap operas, even though i never watch them. but i do love this film because it's so crazy and off the wall, that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television. in my opinion, it's the best film of 1991.
