i personally thought the movie was pretty good, very good acting by tadanobu asano of ichi the killer fame. i really can't say much about the story, but there were parts that confused me a little too much, and overall i thought the movie was just too lengthy. other than that however, the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the locations were beautifully shot, great effects, and a lot of sword play. another solid effort by tadanobu asano in my opinion. well i really can't say anymore about the movie, but if you're only outlook on asian cinema is crouching tiger hidden dragon or house of flying daggers, i would suggest you trying to rent it, but if you're a die-hard asian cinema fan i would say this has to be in your collection very good japanese film.
