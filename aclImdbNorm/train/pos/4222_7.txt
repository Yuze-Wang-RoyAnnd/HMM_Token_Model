i like this episode quite a bit, ruth gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was. as has been stated, the music is very good, and it has a moodiness that doesn't exist in all episodes.<br /><br />but one major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. it is established that the light doesn't work in the vault. don't you think that the very intelligent columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? you'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. granted this is tv whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring.<br /><br />it really doesn't make columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the "death bed" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days.
