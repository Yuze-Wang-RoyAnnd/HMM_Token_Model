i thought it was an extremely clever film. i was very pleased with it and truly couldn't' ask for more. i actually own the film because i didn't return it to someone... which i should do, but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it. also, the fact i don't own too many foreign films and this is a first. now, i personally love finnish stuff so, that definitely added to how much i enjoyed it. but overall, its worth watching. however, if you're not into the whole trying to understand finnish or read subtitles bit, then this film is not for you.<br /><br />9/10 for sure.
