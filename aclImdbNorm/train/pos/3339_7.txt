the farrelly brothers, bobby and peter, are at it again. with "fever pitch" the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes, abandon that tactic when they decided to bring nick hornby's film to the screen, something that it would have been hard to do. the novel, of the same title, dealt with a man's obsession with soccer, since it is set in england, where that sport consumes most of british sports fans. it's to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell, to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most americans, when they make their hero, a boston red sox fan.<br /><br />"fever pitch" is a film that presents an obsessive fan, ben wrightly, whose life revolves into the red sox season, and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them. when ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm, he meets, and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy lindsey meeks, a young woman who is going places, but at thirty, has no life of her own.<br /><br />the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox, at home games, in fenway park. this team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world, having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but, until 2004, never won a world series. in fact, the ending, from what we heard, had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years! drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film. ms. barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera. jimmy fallon, a popular television comedian, turned movie actor, has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in "taxi", in our humble opinion.<br /><br />the farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale.
