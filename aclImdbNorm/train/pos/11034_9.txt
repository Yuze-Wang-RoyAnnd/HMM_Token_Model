eric valette is obviously a talented film-maker, and so are the two guys who wrote the script. therefore mal'efique is a great flick, made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination. well, i'm a bit exaggerating, but nevertheless i'm sincere. so, if you like dark, gory movies, go and see this one. it's really worth it.
