the unborn is a roger corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless. if you hate pregnant women, check out this movie because it's chock full of preggo killings and failed abortions. brooke adams stars as virginia. her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic because they can't have kids on their own. there they meet dr. meyerling (james karen of rotld 1 & 2). dr. meyerling has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant. (insert joke here.) is it because he's creating some genetic killer supermutant babies? that's what virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment. that's when she starts taking matters into her own hands.<br /><br />on this one, you'll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if i told ya all the goodies this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your netflix rental queue too quickly. it's a bit slow-moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third, all systems are go! very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un-pc fetal violence. 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars.
