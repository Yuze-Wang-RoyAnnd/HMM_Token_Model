unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for imdb equate low budget with not good. whatever else this movie might need, more budget really isn't part of it. big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another lara croft movie. what we have here is a step or two better than that.<br /><br />the nearly unknown alexandra staden is captivating as the enigmatic modesty, and this is crucial for this movie to work. her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable, and you find yourself wishing that the camera won't leaver her face. it makes it workable that the bad guy nikolai, played by also little known (in the u.s. at least) nikolaj coaster-waldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her, something modesty can exploit. she is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out "stop wasting my time!" then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen. making a scene like that plausible doesn't happen by accident.<br /><br />probably the biggest problem i have with the rail-thin staden playing modesty is it just isn't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like coaster-waldau and beat him. she just ain't a peta wilson or a pumped-up hilary swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch. coaster-waldau letting himself be overpowered by staden looks like he's just roughhousing with his little sister.<br /><br />since this is not really an action film, this isn't a big flaw. i just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels.
