i guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. and that's exactly what embarrassed taft resident jack dundee (robin williams) intends to do in "the best of times". yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in "good morning, vietnam" is playing football. in this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. but ex-teammate reno hightower (kurt russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily.<br /><br />granted, it's not the best movie for either man. but williams and russell are actually a pretty good comedy team. and some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles (to say the least). check it out.
