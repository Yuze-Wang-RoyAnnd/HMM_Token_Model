the pioneering technicolor cinematography (winner of special technical achievement oscar) is indeed enchanting. add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like marlene dietrich and charles boyer, and you've got a rather pleasant "picture".<br /><br />unfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over-blown acting leave much to be desired. still, there have not been any more breathtaking technicolor films before this one (1936), and very few since then, that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors. cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in "robin hood" (1938), "jesse james" (1939) and "gone with the wind" (1939), will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here. "the garden of allah" will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography.
