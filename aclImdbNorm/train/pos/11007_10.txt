jeremy northam's characterization of the stuttering, mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch. his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face, neck and lips. no matter the brainwashing, love has a way of persevering. love also cannot be "brainwashed in" with either of his two fake wives. in gradual stages, he begins to dispense with his glasses, to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses. the music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and appropriately driving at times. the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi "film noir" in the tradition of many classic thrillers. i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu's portrayal, whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states, the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith, some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part. she is just no match for northam's talents, but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author.
