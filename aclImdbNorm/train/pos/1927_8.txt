with the death of george nader, on 4 february 2002, i thought of this most interesting program, which even though it had only a short run, was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout. generally unseen for over 40+ years it would be worth viewing again. the opening credits showed many differing images, one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp, riding his famed rocket sled, at the point where he was often referred to as "the fastest man alive".
