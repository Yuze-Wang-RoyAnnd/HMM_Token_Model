i rated this film 7/10 which is an average of 8/10 for screenplay, direction and 1944 production values and 6/10 for acting.my acting rating in turn was calculated at 4/10 for all the screen characters except for that played by heroine ella raines as carol richman who was excellent at 8/10.also i commend thomas gomez as inspector burgess whose character convinces that he personally does not think the guilty verdict on scott henderson (alan curtis) was just in view of his naive alibi.these two then form an alliance to prove scott's alibi.<br /><br />i have this film on a "suevia film noir cine negro" dvd in spanish as "la dama desconocida" with the original soundtrack "ingles" as an alternative language, since despite searching i could not find a wholly english version.i was however anxious to see another performance by ella raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in "impact" playing a sole female garage proprietor.here ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several suggestions that she should return to her home in kansas (her boss's pet name for her) before solving the missing alibi.the fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her.he had however designed children's homes and playgrounds so i suppose "family man" had lit up in carol's brain.<br /><br />in the 1940s with "the film code" in operation, producers could only portray sex through metaphors and here it is done in the form of furious drumming played by elisha cooke jnr.carol dolls herself up as a girl of easy virtue in an attempt to lure the drummer into giving her information about "the phantom lady" alibi.the other main character, jack marlow (an associate of scott henderson) is played by franchot tone whose performance i found too theatrical and wondered why carol, for instance, did not notice him constantly and strangely admiring his hands.here the screenplay should have been improved and provided more suspense as these theatrical moves telegraphed the plot far too early to the audience.
