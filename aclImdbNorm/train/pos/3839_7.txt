most people know paul verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) sci-fi movies in hollywood. but long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land. the story is a basic femme fatale premise, nothing new or enthralling. verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences, which instead of defining our main character and his situation, are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot. the screenplay was solid, the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story. what really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting. jereone krabbe was amazing as the "tortured artist", and the supporters were very good as well. also, jan de bont's cinematography adds at least some life to the film, helping to make verhoeven look at least capable as a director.<br /><br />6.5/10<br /><br />* * 1/2 / * * * *
