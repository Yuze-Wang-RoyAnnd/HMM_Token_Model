and this somebody is me. and not only me, as i can see here at imdb or when leaving the theater. why did the people love it? it's obvious: everybody knows zombies by now (at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the "dawn of the dead" reinvention or resident evil movies etc.) <br /><br />or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... that is until this movie came along. and you'll see zombies in a new light (perhaps). this is not a horror movie, although it does contain some violent scenes, but is rather a comedy. a satire to be precise. and it never runs out of steam! that is why i rated it so high. pacing wise it's incredible, the acting is great and the script has no (obvious) mistakes ... quite the contrary: it's a gem and if you're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it! and even if you dislike them, watch it! because it's a great (comedy) movie!
