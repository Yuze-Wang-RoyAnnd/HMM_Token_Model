given the low budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. it is plausible, realistic, and shows how the csikos (hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis. we are drawn into strong feelings for the young, impressionable, yet highly courageous boy--who admires the american pilot. if you're looking for special effects, superman heroes, and magical endings--this movie is not for you. if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent, amoral nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be enthralled by this movie. i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs, and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end, this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time.
