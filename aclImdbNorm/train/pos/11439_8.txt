ok - as far as the 2 versions of this movie. there were 2 people involved in the making - john korty and bill couterie (george was just the producer - he really didn't have any kind of say so in the film - just helped with money) - the 'adult' version was made possible by bill couterie. john korty didn't like or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). thanks to ladd films going under, they didn't advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for "the right stuff", hoping it would pull them through;... and it didn't. so, this movie never really had a chance. when "twice" made it to cable (hbo) - they showed the reels with bill's version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore (did you notice how the 'adult' version wasn't on for very long?). showtime got the 'clean' version. the version on the videotape and laser-disc is the version approved by john (who holds more power than bill). it's a pity, really, as the 'adult' version is actually better and does make more sense. but it's very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd (or any other format short of bootleg). sorry to disappoint everyone. i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club (still have numerous items from the movie - used to own a letter-boxed version of the 'adult' version, but it was stolen - only have a partial hbo copy of it now). 8 stars to the 'adult' version - 5 to the 'clean' version. any other questions, just ask.
