a damn good movie! one that is seriously underrated. the songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain, but also their hope for the future. whoopi goldberg puts in a good performance here, but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character. i wish she was in more movies.<br /><br />this movie should have a higher rating. i give it a 10/10.
