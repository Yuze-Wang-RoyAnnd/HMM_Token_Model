no day passes without a new released computer animated movie, so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects. after watching ice age i felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre.<br /><br />but it's because i am a big guy now, and i am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children (maybe up to 14). the story is quite simple, and the "actors" are funny in a cute way, without any crude or complex humour. even the "evil" is lovely, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. and the story has a happy end, which was a small disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way) but a great thing for children. and apart from some fights nobody dies (not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth, several times), which made a cartoony feeling.<br /><br />the computer animation part is nice but nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes, when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics. [which means lots of work nevertheless!]<br /><br />there were some gags which made me smile - i accept, the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, since it does not feel to fit into the story.<br /><br />overall it's a nice movie, but it's rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche. if you don't hate cute animals making funny things, watch it at least once.
