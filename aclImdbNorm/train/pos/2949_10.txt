this is the funniest stand up i have ever seen and i think it is the funniest i will ever see. if you don't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity, then this is just not your cup of tea. but i honestly don't know anyone who has seen this that hasn't liked it. it is now 17 years later and my friends and i still quote everything from goonie goo goo to the fart game, aunt bunnie to the ice cream man, ralph and ed to get out!! there are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly haven't seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever. take any of robin williams, damon wayans, the dice, george carlin or even the greats like richard pryor or red foxx and this will surpass it. i don't know how or where murphy got some of his material but it works. that is what it comes down to. it is funny as hell.<br /><br />could you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to eddie doing buckwheat and mr. rogers and such on snl? if you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the f-word for the first time, they are in complete shock.<br /><br />his first time he says the f-word is when he does the skit about mr. t being a homosexual.<br /><br />" hey boy, hey boy. you look mighty cute in them jeans. now come on over here, and f@** me up the ass!"<br /><br />the crowd erupts in gales of laughter. no one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them. but the results were just awesome. i have never been barraged with relentless comedy the way i was in this stand-up. in fact, the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing wasn't until 1999 when i saw south park: bigger longer and uncut . that comedy was raw and unapologetic and it went for the jugular, as did delirious. i don't think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh. it is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video.<br /><br />" i took your kids fishing last week. and i put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes gus. normal kids don't do shit like that gus. then they started movin their heads around like this and the m****f***** come up with fish. then they looked at each other and said goonie goo goo! i said can you believe this f****n shit?!"<br /><br />see it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off!<br /><br />10 out of 10
