well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems. being a self confessed horror fan i sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect. after 2 or 3 mins i actually found myself scared (quite rare). the film obviously has a small budget and is set around charing cross station but the films lack of money does not distract from the story. yes the story is a bit far fetched and doesn't explain itself very well but the creep is a class act and proceeds to slash and dismember anything that comes its way. message for ladies !!! there are certain parts of the film you should close your eyes at or at least cross your legs !! you will understand when you see it.<br /><br />all in all a good film and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that actually scares
