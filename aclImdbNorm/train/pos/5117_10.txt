very few movies have had the impact on american culture the way urban cowboy has. thank god it was temporary. but uc is almost in a class by itself as one of those flicks that when you're flipping channels at 3:00am you just can't take your eyes off....my top three are animal house and walking tall btw but that's beside the point. i remember urban cowboy hit the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks being opened on every corner, men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny loafers, and if you didnt know how to two-step you were considered a social moron! personally i think it's a great movie. travolta really surprised me on the heels of satnitefever. who'd a thunk. he's actually believable too. the soundtrack is awesome. too bad charlene tilton, of tv's dallas fame ruined johnny lee's career cause that guy was just terrific. the show stealer here is scott glenn as the greaser ex-con redneck cowboy. and i ain't got nothing against greaser ex-con cowboys semi-being one myself, but i've always envied what i feel to be the greatest power line of all time...."pack-at s*#t!" sort of like clint's "make my day." and watching him slap sissy around is the closest thing i'll see to my julia roberts fantasy so..... like i said, beautiful. 9/10
