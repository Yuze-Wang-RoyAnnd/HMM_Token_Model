this miracle of a movie is one of those films that has a lasting, long term effect on you. i've read a review or two from angry people who i guess are either republicans or child beaters, and their extremist remarks speak of the films power to confront people with their own darkest secrets. no such piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. the realism of the movie and it's performance by bret carr is not to be missed. the very nature of it's almost interactive effect, will cause people to leave the theater either liberated or questioning their very identity. bravo on the next level of cinema.
