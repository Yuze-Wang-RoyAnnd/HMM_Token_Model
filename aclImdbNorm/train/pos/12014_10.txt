this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time. the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie. the story was accurately portrayed. the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo, illinois. she has become a member of the lds church and he has not. he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging. she encourages him to read about joseph smith, the prophet. this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins. the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time. it was graphic at times, but was needed. the emotional expression was very believable, which caused my emotions to spill out. filming was awesome. the way in which the story was presented was touching. after the movie was over, we just sat there unable to moved. i was stunned. for people who know very little of joseph smith, the mormon prophet, i would encourage you to see this. if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life. for those who are members of the church, i would encourage you to see it. it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man. this is a must see.
