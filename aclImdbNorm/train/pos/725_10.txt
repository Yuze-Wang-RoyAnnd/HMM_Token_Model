fascist principal miss togar(mary woronov, who is lensed by expert photographer dean cundy as if she were ten feet tall)has a plan to turn her high completely square. complications ensue which challenge that goal in delightful rock'n'roller riff randell(pj soles who lights up the screen--she's got a hot bod, too)who is an obsessive fan of the punk band the ramones. pal kate rambeau(dey young, whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide her stunning beauty)joins forces with riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good which is togar's desired mission.<br /><br />vincent van patten has a hilarious role as tom roberts, a success at everything, but getting laid. kate is crazy about tom..if only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it. clint howard steals the film almost(honestly, who can steal this film away from soles?)as eaglebauer, "the supplier" who can get everyone almost anything. his office is located in the boy's restroom! paul bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of riff's when he enjoys a concert of the ramones.<br /><br />a raucous high school romp that defies all rules of normalcy..and i loved it. it's like someone just says, "let's make life fun for 1 1/2  hours." the film really is anarchy..a plot-less chaos lovingly adoring the ramones with all it's heart(even if they are horrible actors, they have an opportunity to gain new audiences with this film).<br /><br />the ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole..riff and her classmates take over the high school and one massive party begins. to be honest, i didn't want the party to end! not conventional in any way whatsoever, this film just let's loose a frenzy. accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of the ramones best songs, this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war didn't dominate headlines and people just had a good time. those, i guess were the days.
