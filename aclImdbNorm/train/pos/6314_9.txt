i went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect. and it turn out into a very enjoyable, die-laughing experience! it's an excellent movie with very unexpected story, very good dialogs and crazy humor. all characters are obviously made in "alan ford" (italian satiric comic) style, but that haven't bothered me for a second. in fact this kind of loser-bums line-up made a movie quite unique and interesting. sam rockwell gave very good and convincing role, willian macy too, clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant. but real star is actually guzman. he made a role of his life in this movie! the scene when his character cosimo dies in the movie, is so hilarious that it made me choke and almost die with him! highly recommended for all "alan ford" fans!
