i have seen slaughter high several times over the years, and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor, but i never knew that it was filmed in the uk, and i never knew that the actor that plays marty rantzen (simon scuddamore) committed suicide after the film was released. i guess i did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for americans, and a few of them aren't very good at hiding their english accents.<br /><br />all that aside though, this is the tale of the class nerd, marty, who is the butt of jokes from his classmates, and on one particular day, april fools day, he's lured into the girl's locker room by one caroline munro (yes, playing a teenager) and humiliated big time on film. of course, the coach catches the gang at work & they're all given a vigorous workout to punish them, but not before a couple of the guys slip marty a joint, which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab, but it's full of something that makes him sick & when he runs to the restroom, one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something marty is mixing, which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid, which leaves poor marty burned & horribly scarred.<br /><br />ten years later, this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old doddsville high, which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible, but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelict...except there's a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course, they eat, drink, and be merry. for soon, they will die, of course.<br /><br />the gang is stalked one-by-one by a figure in a jester's mask, but could it be marty? they don't know, they figure he's either in a loony bin or working for ibm, they're not sure which. but whoever it is, he's making quick work of them. particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer. she is victim to an acid bath which i believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version, because it seemed extra nasty when i watched it this time. i could be wrong but i believe that wasn't on the tape.<br /><br />at any rate, there's somewhat of a twist ending, and that also contains footage not on the tape, i believe. there's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised, but apart from that i didn't really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version, probably so but it's been a while since i've last seen it.<br /><br />at any rate, if you're a fan of 80's slasher flicks then snap up the new release dvd, because it's a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere & feel to it. 7 out of 10.
