maybe it wasn't that good as a whole, but the second episode, which was the first one i say, was so memorable i still remember it today. i became a fan of dick francis. i would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries.<br /><br />the cockney slang of the sidekick, chico barnes, is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing london's bow bells, but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting.<br /><br />sid halley was one of francis' more interesting characters, and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand. interestingly, electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after world war ii.
