this is a great game! okay perhaps it didn't have some of the features it was meant to have but digital anvil have still come up with a good game. there is a certain similarity to elite(you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo off destroyed ships, go on missions)however this game features a heavily scripted mission. it is a great mission. the control system is different it uses the mouse! you basically fly you spaceship around a system and work your way up! the game features some pretty good graphics even through it was made in 2003. it should run well on even a modestly specified pc. the story features some great voice acting from john rhys davies, george takei, jennifer hale(she appears in every computer game). stick with the story it gets better and better as it goes on. there is even a race section, where you and an opponent have to race your spaceships around a course(it involves you going through rings). this section took me a while to beat. it adds variety to the game. some sections are a little tough here and there but overall you can beat this game. the game has an active mod scene on the net. pick up some mods to extend the game. i haven't played any of the mods yet. <br /><br />sadly a sequel to this was cancelled, a shame!
