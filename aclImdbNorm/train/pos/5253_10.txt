i really don't understand why people get so upset and pan this movie! remember folks, this is an snl movie, not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction! the ladies man is a hilarious movie, albeit stupid at times, with a wacked-out cast and, as usual, wonderful performances by will ferrel and tim meadows. yes some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are unbelievable but its comedy! i really don't understand how anyone couldn't laugh a lot during this hilarious film. anyway, all i ask is that people take this as it is--an snl, silly and irreverent comedy. nothing that will win awards, but nonetheless, some modern comedy gold.
