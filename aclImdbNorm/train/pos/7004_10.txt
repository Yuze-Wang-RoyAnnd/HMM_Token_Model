will smith is one of the best actors of all time. i don't know how he does it. i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it. he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there. this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet. i watched it on saturday and i still cannot get it out of my head. amazing and sad all at the same time. thanks again will. you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie. you cannot miss a thing. make sure you have plenty of kleenex and your man/woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle. well worth the money that you will pay to watch it.. don't wait for it to come on tv.
