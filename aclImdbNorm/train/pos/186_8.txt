there are some wonderful things about this movie. marion davies could act, given the right property; she is wonderful in comedic roles. william haines could act, and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular leading men. (until a potential scandal forced him from the business).<br /><br />the story is a bit trite, but handled so beautifully that you don't notice. king vidor's direction is one of the principle reasons for this. the producer? the boy genius, irving thalberg.<br /><br />it's about movie making, and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928, the cameras, sets, directors directing and actors emoting. you get to see (briefly) some of the major stars of the day; even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself, seeking an autograph. you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman, elinor glyn, claire windsor, king vidor, and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographs.<br /><br />please, even if you're not a fan of the silents, take the time to catch this film when you can. it's really a terrific trip back in time.
