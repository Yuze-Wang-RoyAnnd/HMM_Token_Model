stephen king was raised on flicks like this. -flicks not films.<br /><br />movies like this and 'jeepers creepers' are "throwbacks" to the good 'ol day drive-in horror flicks. they are meant to be fun, cheaply made and hopefully: a few good scares.<br /><br />anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that's all this is... all it ever will be.<br /><br />stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash. -good, fun, trash!<br /><br />if you enjoyed this i recommend: 'jeepers creepers' 'jeepers creepers 2' '30 days of night' 'scarecrows'('88) 'they live' 'planet terror' 'death proof' and 'halloween iii: season of the witch'
