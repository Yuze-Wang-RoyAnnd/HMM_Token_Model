this is an excellent, fast paced thriller by wes craven (nightmare on elm street), who for 85 minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying - the evil of human beings. we are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of jackson rippner than freddy kruger, and cillian murphy (batman begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly, even charismatic killer. the performances by murphy and by rachel mcadams (claire, from the wedding crashers)are brilliant. most of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. it is action on a small scale, not the broad sweep of the canvas, and it is no less compelling for these limitations. the cinematography is nothing special, though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet, but the dialog is excellent, the story taut. there are no distractions, no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters. by keeping his focus and avoiding distractions, wes craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting, fast-paced action thriller.
