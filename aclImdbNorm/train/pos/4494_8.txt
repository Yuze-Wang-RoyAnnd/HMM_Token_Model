as an native of bolton, this film has obvious appeal for me. the location shots are fascinating and show a bolton very much in transition - there are a number of scenes of apparent dereliction but this serves to show the town being rebuilt - and the idea that the old must make way for the new is right at the heart of this film. a slightly miscast james mason leads an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss over a herring that spirals into a full-blown generational conflict, then a pleasingly schmaltzy resolution. though i'm a bit too young to remember it fully, the minutiae of lancashire life in the 60s is all here: cashing up on a friday, songs round the piano, the sunday constitutional, good neighbourliness, the trepidations of courtship, the massive importance of self-respect, and i was pleased to see naughton's funniest lines from the play left intact. there is no doubt that this film ought to be made available on dvd - it is well crafted and most performances are well realised.
