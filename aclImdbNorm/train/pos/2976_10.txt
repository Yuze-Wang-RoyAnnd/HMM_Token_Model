for a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and trey parker and matt stone's comic timing is perfect. there are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie. i especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes. robert stacks unsolved mysteries spoof is also very amusing.
