i like films that don't provide the typical "happy ending," and that's my main reason for my liking of this movie. alice marano (danes) and her best friend darlene (beckinsale) are arrested in thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the thai authorities. the film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether (or which) of the girls was involved, and bill pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer. jacqueline kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind, magnanimous wife, yon, who is also an attorney. i wish the girls had been abused more in the prison, as another commenter has suggested, as i've heard that thai prisons can be quite brutal. where this film grabs me, however, is its ending. alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that darlene can be pardoned, and we (the viewers) realize that they are both innocent. any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me, and this well-acted drama is certainly deserving.
