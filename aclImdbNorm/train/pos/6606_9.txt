time for hollywood to sit up and take notice! if the actors are acting snooty, all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel. renaissance is probably the first animation flick which makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings. although the voice overs by the cast (craig, mccormack, pryce etc.) are some of the best i have ever heard but even then the emotions portrayed by the 'cartoons' are unnerving.<br /><br />this style of animation is not very new but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting. ironically, such technical wizardry makes you forget that this is actually a very very nice movie. the pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crisp.<br /><br />plot: disappearance of a mega corporation's top employee unravels a tale of deceit and corruption with a cold hearted hero at the helm. can't say much without giving it all away...except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you speechless.<br /><br />a must watch..even for the 'grown-ups' who smirk at 'cartoons'
