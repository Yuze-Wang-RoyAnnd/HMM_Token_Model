now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i'm appalled. for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i'm afraid i don't know what the world has come to. let me tell u something. i started watching many t.v shows like lost, prison break, dexter, deadwood and even invasion. but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season. then we have the sopranos. i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season, and more importantly all of its episodes. there is no department that this show doesn't excel in. acting- nothing short of superb. james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode, after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would've been the better choice, however after watching the first few episodes, i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony. the raw emotion he displays is superb. then we have everyone else, edie falco, michael imperioli, lorraine bracco, dominic chianese (whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part 2) and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie 'walnuts' gualtieri and silvio dante. all of these actors perform to the best quality, and all giving an excellent performance in each episode. then we have the story, never have i been so sucked into a t.v show before. the story is nothing short of excellent. each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic. i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of. its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence, but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television, and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show. not just say its too violent, or they feel that the character of tony is immoral, i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day, i don't think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god. i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me, you'll be hooked from the very first episode, i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show, hooked on it. trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t.v. after you've watched the first season, you'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television, and no t.v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos.
