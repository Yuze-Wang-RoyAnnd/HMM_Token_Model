if i watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it's got to be pretty good. i'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist. i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (the english patient, shakespeare in love, atonement, crash. this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end. acting is great, story is absolutely original, flash-back technique very affective. there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him, but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to, rather than a rip-off of, orson.
