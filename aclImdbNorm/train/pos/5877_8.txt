okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch . it's about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when mac ( akshay kumar ) starts dating with 3 air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious . sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely . but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses . there's garam masala at every step of the movie , songs rock but somethings lacking . the comedy's not up to the mark and deserves an award . its nice but not all that excellent . some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it didn't deserve that many laughs . but of course everyone's opinion is different . so if you wanna watch the movie you're welcome to do so .
