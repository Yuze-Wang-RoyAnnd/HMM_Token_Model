and possibly closest to the dickens story line. although i find the young ebenezer hard to watch (who's idea was that period hair, surely they could have done better than that!), scott does an incredible job as scrooge. his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me. edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present. i find g.c. scott's scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart. the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he hasn't 'missed it', is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus overact. he's phenomenal here. nearly the entire cast is incredible. the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at, almost too sweet. still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday. enjoy!
