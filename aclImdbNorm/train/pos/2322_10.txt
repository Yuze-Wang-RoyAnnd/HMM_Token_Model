that magical moment in life, that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood, and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood . . . this is what this movie is all about. <br /><br />danni (wonderfully played by reese witherspoon) is right at that moment in life when the movie starts. she swoons over elvis, playing his records and wishfully thinking about love. maureen her sister will soon be off to college, has no trouble with attracting boys, is beautiful, and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn't. she dates a local loser whos father is also after her, and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet. danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn't good enough. she wants to be maureen but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself.<br /><br />the moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets court foster for the first time. court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers. he has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun. on one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find danni skinny dipping. they yell and argue and danni leaves. but they see each other a day later when courts mother is invited to danni's to visit old friends(danni's parents). danni becomes attracted to court, and court to danni. she is a tomboy and is spunky, has attitude and says whats on her mind. <br /><br />court is 17 and danni 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between court working the farm. by the time court kisses her one day, danni is smitten. danni's father tells her to invite court to the house and he does. but things are uncomfortable for court on his "sort of date". the silence though is broken by his meeting with maureen who has yet to see court. one look between the two and its all over. the looks of pain and defeat on danni's face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time. the rest of the movie i will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters.<br /><br />the greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love, and the pain they must endure both together and individually. danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair, painful, and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started. few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly. this movie has since the first time i watched it stuck in my mind. its in the my top 100 movie list and deservedly so. i only wish more movies like this were made, because if so . . . my faith in hollywood would be a lot better.
