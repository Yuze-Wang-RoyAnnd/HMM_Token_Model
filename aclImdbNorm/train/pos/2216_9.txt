historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war new orleans. starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin. this is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because these were free people. they may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors. the young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives, whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community. i enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were christophe, anna bella, and marcel.
