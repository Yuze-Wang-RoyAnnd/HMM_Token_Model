there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups. it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers. this film also included one of the most imaginative "escape" scenes in recent years. the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller.<br /><br />although the plotting of the film was convoluted, the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed.<br /><br />in 1949, george orwell suggested in his famous novel "1984" that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state, which would control minds and diminish human liberty. it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film, it was not the state, but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.
