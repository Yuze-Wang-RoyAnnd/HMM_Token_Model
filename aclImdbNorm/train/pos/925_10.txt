one word: supurrrrb! i don't think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television. watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring re-runs. <br /><br />i have to say i had my reservations. after all, critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show. but when half an hour was over (by the way, thank you, nbc, for running a commercial-free show), i was left with the feeling of instant love, love at first glance, the true love that one feels in his guts. everything about this show screamed excellence.<br /><br />graphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek. no small feat considering those movies took years to be developed.<br /><br />cast was marvelous. i am partial to john goodman's voice, but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john. special mention: lisa kudrow's guest appearance. she was on top of the game creating neurotic, pudgy, and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her. (panda from brooklyn? only in this show.) <br /><br />script was funny, with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp, yet not tacky. a note for all parents: this is not for children. this show was never advertised as such, and there's a reason why it's set for 9pm, not 8pm. so if you'd like to complain about "objectionable context", save your breath. adults deserve a comedy made just for them, and father of the pride is it. <br /><br />not everything was perfect. i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roy's characters. do i sense "stereotype" when it comes to them? yes, they are gay. yes, they are flamboyant. yes, they speak with german accents. but that's yesterday's news. give us something new, something fresh, something funny. putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach. i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "star power" that these guys have. that's fine by me. but please don't dwell on something everybody already knows by heart. hopefully, the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over. <br /><br />in general, the show is definitely a must-see-tv. funny, witty, with a few unexpected twists here and there -- there haven't been a comedy this good since seinfeld. i am certainly looking forward to the next episode.
