chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos. unfaltering performances, rock-solid writing, and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever.<br /><br />all of the cast are strong, but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy's. anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes; particularly from the first few seasons. james gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely terrifying, and you still find yourself loving him - mesmerized by him.<br /><br />many people that i've spoken to about the sopranos (who haven't seen it yet) will say "i'm just not a fan of mafia movies/shows". whatever. run - don't walk - and get it. those same people usually love "e.r.", but i bet they don't much care for hospitals... it's not about the context.
