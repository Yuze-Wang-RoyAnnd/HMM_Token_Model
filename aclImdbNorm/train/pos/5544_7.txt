prc which was the lowest of the low actually struck gold with this moody little thriller. they did the same thing a year earlier with "detour" which is probably one of the finest low-budget films ever made.<br /><br />"strangler" is basically a one set film, filled with mist and shadows, a technique used by most poverty row studios to hide the sets, or lack thereof. but here, it works well. the ghost of charles middleton (better known as ming the merciless) lurches around the swamp killing those involved in his wrongful execution for murder and generates some sympathy from the viewer. his final victim is to be the daughter of the ferryman.....he concentrates his wrath not only on those directly involved in his fate but their relatives as well.<br /><br />rosemary laplanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style. she offers herself up to the strangler in order to put a stop to the killing but as a sop to the audience, the strangler sees the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the hereafter, somewhat chastened. if ulmer(who directed "detour") has directed "strangler" she would be hanging from the nearest tree and the strangler's job would be done. but who's complaining? it's not the story that is the major attraction but the shrouded sets, lighting and the general moodiness of the piece. it stands, right behind "detour", as prc's finest hour
