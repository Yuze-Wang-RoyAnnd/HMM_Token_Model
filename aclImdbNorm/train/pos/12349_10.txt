this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions,muti-billion dollar computer graphics,or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie, all you need is a excellent story line and plot. which the master of all japanese films,akira kurosawa pulls off brilliantly. i recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece. and for those that enjoy kurosawas earlier works. 10/10
