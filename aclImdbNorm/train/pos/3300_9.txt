pakeezah has a very interesting history (which is well documented in the 'trivia' section) about how it came to be. it seems as if destiny conspired to test kamal amrohi (the director) while at the same time secretly desiring to see him complete his masterpiece.<br /><br />pakeezah rides on metaphors, poetry and visual elocution. as a result the intensity with which emotions come out achieve a dimension which may not be very real but are very effective and leave an impact on the viewer.<br /><br />meena kumari lives the tragedy of nargis and sahib jaan like her own. the other stars of the film, besides her, are ghulam mohammed (the music director), lata mangeshkar, naushad (background score) and joseph wirsching (the d.o.p). their music and cinematography leaves you spell bound.<br /><br />pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. it reveals new layers to you every time you watch it again. kamal amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and he left us all a gift.
