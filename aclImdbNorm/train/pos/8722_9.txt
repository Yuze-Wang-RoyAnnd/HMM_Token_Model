for starters, it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh (check out the two russian bugs).<br /><br />a bug's life has a classical disney storyline, but that's one of the good things about the movie. family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end. and it also has a couple of great voice-overs by dave foley, julia-louise dreyfus, kevin spacey (of course),... but actually, the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation. it's just wonderful. all the details, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds... and the guys and girls at pixar made it all look so realistic. all in all, a very nice piece of work. this is the best animation by disney since aladdin.
