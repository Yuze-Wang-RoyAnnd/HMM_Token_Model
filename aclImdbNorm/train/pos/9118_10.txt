i saw this film with a special screening of the work of owen alik shahadah. it is so interesting where did this guy come from. now he is probably the key independent african filmmaker in the world. and i am not talking about black filmmakers i am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture. the idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of african themes, with his film 500 years later it is a african issue. but the idea doesn't fit that mold. showing the artistic diversity. the film is an all african cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to. i just love the mild comedy in it. and the kora of tunde jegede is just amazing, it is really a art-house gem.
