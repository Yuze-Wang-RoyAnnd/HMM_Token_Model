comparable to fight club, the matrix, a.i., sixth sense, among others. this film approaches the psyche in a way never done before. the first 30 minutes builds a interesting love story between diaz-cruise-cruz. the rest of the movie is, well, confusing, you'll pick more every time you watch it (i've gone to the movies to see it 3 times now)
