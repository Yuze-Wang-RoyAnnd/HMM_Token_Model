this is indeed a funny show, done in a creepy sort of way, much like a tim burton film. it's worth a look, as it's far more creative than most of the shows this season. best of all, it's not a "reality" show. i'm wondering why the viewing public is so ready to accept shows like that (which lack creativity) and ignore wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative bent.<br /><br />while some decry the premise, i think it's really unusual. much more enjoyable than "ghost whisperer" and "medium". i think it's the funniest thing on the tube since "my name is earl".<br /><br />oh, and the narration and music are wonderful. if you enjoy shows that are a bit off the beaten path, i'd recommend it. it's not as strange as twin peaks was, but it's got a serious kink to it.
