i haven't seen bsg, i tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it. however, i saw caprica rebirth yesterday i felt a little lost, so i decided to watch the pilot today and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now i want to watch bsg as well.<br /><br />but what i really liked is that i didn't have to be a hardcore bsg fan to understand what's going on in caprica. from what i have read in the net, they were trying to reach the female population since bsg reached way more men, and at least in my case it worked.<br /><br />however, i suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the pilot.
