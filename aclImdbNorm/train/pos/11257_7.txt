erotic cinema of the 1970's was tame compared to the triple x romps of today, which is good. because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes. of course, i wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little. plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods, but it's worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled the devil's plaything. but if you don't care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex, then this isn't the movie for you. however, i did enjoy it and i give it...7 stars.
