i loved this show growing up and i still watch the first season dvd at age 19 today. what can i say? i grew up in a house much like the one on full house. i had a dad, two sisters, and a dog. i guess the only difference was that i did not live with my uncle and my dad's best friend. also, i grew up with my mom in the house. i don't know what i would have done without full house on television. i think that stephanie (played by jodie sweetin), d.j. (played by kirk cameron's sister candace), and michelle (played by mary-kate and ashley olsen) are my favorite characters. i can relate to each of them because i am the middle child of my family like steph, i am a younger sister like michelle, and i am an older sister like d.j. i really like how the show always has moral values because i don't really like any of the o.c.-like shows today. i like the comedy of full house, too. uncle jesse (john stamos), joey (dave coulier), and danny (bob saget) are hilarious as the girls' uncle, dad's friend, and dad, respectively. the story goes that, after the girls' mom dies, danny's best friend joey and his brother-in-law, jesse move in to help raise the kids. three men trying to raise three young girls=hilarious. each character on full house is full of heart, funny, and genuinely believable. joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid's heart and soul. jesse is the cool, motorcycle riding, tough-guy uncle who is softened by his three nieces, and later, his wife becky (laurie laughlin, from summerville). both kids and adults will love this show. guaranteed.
