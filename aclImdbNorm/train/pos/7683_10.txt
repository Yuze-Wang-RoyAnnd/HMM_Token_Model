i loved good times with the rest of many of you. i love reading intelligent and insightful commentary. the writers on this show were fantastic and the actors were beyond talented. to answer strawberry22 (the neatest commentary to the other superior and positive commentary)...what happened was that james was killed in an accident (i believe i remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it first aired and i was a tiny thing...it was so sad to me..).<br /><br />florida and the children actually get out of the projects and even become neighbors with willona (wilnona) and that is how the very last show ended.<br /><br />all of the children achieved their dreams and found opportunity in each of their dreams. it was a wonderful ending and i cried because i was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that i actually believed in their fate. i hope that this kind of ending rings true in actually for many.<br /><br />a great show and many other great shows followed including benson and the jeffersons. this was an awesome period for african-american television and the best writers were awesome at that time. tv land is awesome for the memories and i just love it because i cannot stand the junk that we are watching today. somebody...bring back the 1970s and 1980s quickly...your intelligent viewers are a dying breed out here and we need better material.<br /><br />love, a tv land original sitcom junkie of the 70s and 80s (as they sing in "all in the family"...those were the days......
