it was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all-star flick. i laughed through the entire picture, as did my entire family. the movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy--the players were hysterical--i'll bet they had a good old time while making it. of course goldblum and dreyfuss were great--and how about those everly sisters, each of the two falco's, and the divine music throughout. rob reiner made a great laughing limo driver, and gabriel byrne a laughable neurotic. not to mention gregory hines, burt reynolds, the sleepy joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references. paul anka was his usual entertaining self, with the added attraction of running scared after byrne decided to make a duet of his "my way" welcome home to vick performance.<br /><br />i am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to frank sinatra and friends; dreyfuss imitated him well. i am also of the opinion that no one, of any age, would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie--it's a joke--not a terrifying "gangsta" film. the cars and clothing were impressive, as was the decorative, "vic's place."<br /><br />truly, i think of "mad dog time" as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, tv crime dramas, and talk shows. i would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment.
