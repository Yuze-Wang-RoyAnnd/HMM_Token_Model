before i begin, let me tell you how great this stand-up special sounds when you play sonic adventure i dx: director's cut at the same time (red mountain level in particular). so while watching this stand-up special, i suggest-- no, demand you do it.<br /><br />carlos mencia takes his stand-up to the extreme in san francisco, california. there, he makes fun of everybody with absolutely no apologies.<br /><br />i am pretty much thanking god here that carlos didn't do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over and over and over again. he does a tremendous job making fun of everyone and at the same time be truthful about it; i know a couple of times i said, after carlos said a joke, "damn, this guy makes a good point!" and then the game over screen came over my tv because i forgot i was playing sonic adventure i dx: director's cut. my bad :) so yeah, there's nothing to complain about this stand-up special. if you have tivo or something like that, please do yourself a favor and record this historic hour.
