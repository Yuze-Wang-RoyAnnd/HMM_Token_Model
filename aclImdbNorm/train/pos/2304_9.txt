i thought this movie was very well done. taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked accurate to me. it was well cast and believable. i don't usually care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, but i felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt, you got to really know them and care about them. it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups. after the movie was over i wished there was a part two. i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family. this movie is bound to be a classic. if you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it...
