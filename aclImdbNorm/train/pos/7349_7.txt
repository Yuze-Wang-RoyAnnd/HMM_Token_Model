of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already. 'raja babu' is one of my most favorite characters. i just love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle. watch movies and emulate characters etc etc. i love the scene when a stone cracks in kader khans mouth while eating. also where shakti kapoor narrates a corny story of raja babu's affairs on a dinner table and govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. thats my favorite scene of the film. 'achcha pitaji to main chalta hoon' scene is just chemistry between two great indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs. its brilliant. it's a cat mouse film. just watch these actors helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other. its total entertainment. if you like govinda and kader khan chemistry then its a must. i think rb is 6th in my list by david dhawan. 'deewana mastana', 'ankhein','shola or shabnam', 'swarg', coolie no 1' precedes this gem of a film. 7/10.
