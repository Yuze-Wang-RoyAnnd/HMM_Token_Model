when braveheart first came out, i was enthralled, and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film. when rob roy came out, i was intrigued, and although i enjoyed the film i did not think it was a great film. however, as time has gone by, my appreciation for rob roy has grown, and my enthusiasm for braveheart has diminished. braveheart is great entertainment, to be sure, but there are flaws as well. the most significant, in my view, is the unflattering portrayal of robert the bruce, who was without a doubt scotland's greatest king. another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions. i think i am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film, seen only (at least by me) in retrospect, that the beginnings of mel gibson's egomania can be seen clearly for the first time. in contrast, rob roy has grown on me over the years. partly because it largely avoids the faults i mind most in braveheart. but also because rob roy is like fine wine, growing more mature and complex with each viewing.
