not really a big box office draw, but i was pleasently surprised<br /><br />with this movie. james "i did some things to farrah fawcett" orr <br /><br />co-wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary, average guy<br /><br />named larry burrows who thinks his life would have been<br /><br />incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game<br /><br />when he was 15. but thanks to mysterious and magical bartender<br /><br />mike, larry gets his wish, yet soon realizes that his new life<br /><br />isn't exactly as he hoped it would be.<br /><br />i must say, this movie really impressed me. critics have given<br /><br />it mixed, and i must say the concept is really interesting and<br /><br />pulled off well. yes, it is a little standard, but packs enough<br /><br />funny moments, drama and excellent acting to make it really<br /><br />good. james belushi (i think) was oscar worthy for his role. jon<br /><br />lovitz is perfect, and linda hamilton plus renee russo shine in<br /><br />their roles. michael caine is perfect as the bartender. it's<br /><br />just a good movie with a good lesson. if you've never seen, i<br /><br />highly recommend you check
