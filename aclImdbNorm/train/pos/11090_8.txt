successful self-made married businessman harry mitchell (a superbly steely performance by roy scheider) has an adulteress fling with sweet'n'sexy young stripper cini (the gorgeous kelly preston). harry's blackmailed by a trio of scummy low-life hoods -- sleazy porno theater manager raimy (a splendidly slimy john glover), antsy strip joint owner leo (well played by robert trebor) and crazed pimp bobby shy (a frightfully intense clarence williams iii) -- who have videotaped his affair with cini. when harry refuses to pay up, the hoods kill cini and make it look like harry did it. this in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and wills between harry and the hoods. director john frankenheimer, adopting a tough script based on elmore leonard's gritty crime thriller novel, expertly maintains a steady snappy pace, delivers plenty of gripping tension, and effectively creates a compellingly seedy'n'sordid atmosphere. the leads are all uniformly excellent, with stand-out supporting turns by ann-margret as harry's bitter neglected wife barbara, vanity as brash jaded prostitute doreen, and lonny chapman as harry's loyal business partner jim o'boyle. the tight'n'twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout. the wickedly profane dialogue, jost vacano's glossy cinematography, gary chang's stirring score, the harshly amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well. as an added bonus, both vanity and preston take their clothes off. a very strong and satisfying little number that's well worth checking out.
