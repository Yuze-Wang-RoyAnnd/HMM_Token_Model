i enjoy ralph bakshi films ("wizards", "cool world" and the underrated animated "lord of the rings") and am a frank frazetta collector and fan. i am also a sword and sorcery fan who loves the worlds of edgar rice burroughs and robert e. howard.<br /><br />i missed "fire and ice's" theatrical release back in 1983 and have looked forward to seeing it on video or at some revival ever since then. therefore the 2005 release was a dream come true for me. however, i bought it with some trepidation, because i hoped it would not be only worth watching once and then put on the shelf as a "collectible" gathering dust until the day i died. fortunately my fears were groundless and i was pleasantly impressed with this movie.<br /><br />as with frazetta art this is a gritty film that has a physicality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy/sword and sorcery films without being cheesy or dirty. the art is good and you see glimpses of frazetta at his best. even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again. however, my wife has some objections due to the scantily clad princess (very frazetta-esquire). i don't mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scene.<br /><br />there is roto-scoping used, but personally i enjoy roto-scoping. it gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that is hard to find in animation.<br /><br />despite some continuity problems, i recommend this film to all bakshi, frazetta, conan, and sword and sorcery fans. enjoy!
