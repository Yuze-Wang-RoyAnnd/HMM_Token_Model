as the maker of "this darkness," i admit we neglected 3 very important acknowledgments in our end credits. the omissions were over-sights that could not be corrected once committed, nor did the parties involved --- who saw the movie --- mention it at the time. on behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film, i extend them an apology. obviously, some criticisms posted here are harsh in light of their credit being accidentally. our production values were negligible and our "special effects" were quite special indeed, but the plot is very strong and the cinematography by john mcleod is superb. we hope you, the reader, enjoy "this darkness" and the efforts of those who worked their butts off for free. thank you, dylan o'leary, director.
