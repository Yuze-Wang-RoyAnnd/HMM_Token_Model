in a penitentiary, four prisoners occupy a cell: carr`ere (g'erald laroche), who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife; the drag lassalle (philippe laudenbach) and his prot'eg'ee, the retarded p^aquerette (dimitri rataud), who ate his six months sister; and the intellectual marcus (clovis cornillac), who killed his wife. one night, carr`ere finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. they realize that the book was written by danvers (geoffrey carey) in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. they decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison, when they find the truth about danvers' fate. "mal'efique" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic french low-budget horror movie. the story is practically in the same location, does not have any clich'es and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene. i am a great fan of french cinema, usually romances, dramas and police stories, but i noted that recently i have seen some good french horror movies, such as "un jeu d' enfants", "belphegor" and "dead end". my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "sinais do mal" ("signs of the evil")
