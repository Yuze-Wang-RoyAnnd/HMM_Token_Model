i recall seeing this film on tv some years ago and not paying full attention, maybe even missing the first half, so i came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated. i decided to revisit it last night to see if i had missed anything the first time. i certainly did. this is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever. i can't believe i thought this film was boring! <br /><br />a young jon voight and burt reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by ned beatty and ronny cox. this story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it, it is truly horrifying. oh, and did i mention that the theme song is great, as well? well it is, and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere.<br /><br />everyone should see this movie for the experience. just don't expect a picnic.
