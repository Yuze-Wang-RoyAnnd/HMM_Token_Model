i really loved this version of emma the best. kate beckinsale was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as knightly. the only complaint that i had was on mr. woodhouse..i can't believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life..she was a smart girl in the end though. as always, i love the places in which these jane austin movies were shot. the settings are so spectular. it makes me want to visit england so much 9as well as ireland and scotland) i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines interwhined with emma's most excellently! i am glad that i got to see this one as well.
