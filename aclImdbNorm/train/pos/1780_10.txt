my mother and i were on our way home from a trip up to the north east (mainly massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in boston. now, i don't know much about film so i thought this might be a bit educational. the first movie we saw was this one, the romeo division. now, i don't know about you but i thought this was great! i'm from texas and where i come from we don't see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise. my mother insisted that it was too violent, but said that i didn't know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture. i was shocked by the fight sequences they were great. also, i am a big fan when the good guys win so i was thrilled when romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys. this was true brilliance. i'm not sure when it's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out. i think you'll be pleasantly surprised. a word to the wise though, it is rather violent and there many cuss words so you may not want to let your children watch. it's more for adults.
