branagh and fishburne deliver excellent performances in this version of the shakespeare classic. branagh plays iago better than i've seen the character played in film or on stage. some might say this film is overly iago-centric, but i disagree. fishburne, the first black othello in film history ironically, delivers a powerful performance. fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as the moor of venice may be one of his best. <br /><br />the one problem i have with this film, is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. desdemona's character is given far less depth than she has in the play. in this film, she might as well not be added at all. one of the worst cuts made by branagh in this film, was the subtraction of a conversation between iago and desdemona at the beginning of the second act. this part of the play shows that desdemona may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this film. there were a number of subtractions that hurt the integrity of this film. <br /><br />however, if you have not read the play, or seen a film version of othello before, i recommend this movie. the story, cut or not, is still incredibly enthralling. the acting, as stated previously, is very good. if some important scenes had been added, and desdemona's character been prioritized a bit further, this would be a great movie. as it stands, it's still an admirable version of the original. i give it a marginal recommendation.
