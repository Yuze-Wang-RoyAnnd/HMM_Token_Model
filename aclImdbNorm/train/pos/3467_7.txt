i still wonder why i watched this movie. admittedly, before i viewed this film, i knew practicly nothing about the beatles. i didn't even know all their names! all i knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, john married yoko ono, and john was murdered.<br /><br />also, vh1 isn't even my favorite music station, mtv is. still, for some reason or another i decided to watch it, not expecting much. surprisingly, i enjoyed it very much! the dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up. this is very important, because john and paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. jared harris and adien quinn give good performaces,overall.<br /><br />the ending was also very smart. i enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the snl performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on a good note. my favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.<br /><br />overall, i recommend this film to almost everyone. it is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up paul just showed up on john's doorstep. which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film, settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.
