i must admit - the only reason i bought this movie was because i am a big fan of gackt and a *huge* fan of hyde. i was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were, shall we say, pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story. i mean, the synopsis sounded really out there. and now that i have just finished watching it - i feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance! hyde and gackt both gave heart-wrenching performances, and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie. you get sucked into the story, and you really feel for the characters by the end. the element of vampirism - which i love, but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with - is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic, normal to this setting, rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story. i ranked it at a 9 out of 10 at first...and then i went back and tried to think of why i wasn't giving it that last point. came up with nothing. so a ten out of ten it is. after all - i'm not much of a critic - the fact that i'm bothering to write a review at all means i either really hate the movie or really love it. you can tell what side i'm on with moon child.
