"descent." yeah. boy... i haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since bruno dumont's, "twentynine palms" (2003). (by the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of "female empowerment," "the descent" (2005), directed by our splat pack friend, neil marshall, who also happens to be a major talent his own right.) but getting back to this "descent," the nc-17 rated (uh-oh) effort on which the lovely ms. dawson takes a producer's credit (congratulations) and directed by talia lugacy (strong chance that's not a real name), as good as it is (in moments), it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed. as a producer, you really have to tighten up that script. of course, in the premise alone, you have the promise of rising conflict, but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict.<br /><br />at times, this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and, well, i guess i'll let the others who've already commented here speak to the boringness of it, namely that which occurs in the second act -but find me a second act that isn't boring? there's also this catch 22 that goes along with these quasi-independent films like "descent" in which rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her "fame-identity" to get a script into production that would, under usual circumstances, not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film's leading role. rosario dawson is gorgeous and, apparently, you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long, but, oh, wow-wee, how fast the time just slips away: rosy ain't no undergraduate no more. that's part of the confusion about the screenplay: "is she a graduate student? a ta? no, graduate students don't really have these type of qualms with football players, do they?" again, if you are rosario dawson, executive producer, that's the one of many, many aspects to the professional film process you'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career. and if you don't have the answer to why you're movie isn't convincing, let me tell you: there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious, well-qualified, undergraduate aged talents, pining to get involved in the business, who might have nailed that lead character down, all the while, looking just as darn good as you know who; but unfortunately without ms. dawson -no honey, no money. i have to say, the camera department did an outstanding job, however, because this film is really well shot (i.e. lit) in all its dreary/dreamy darkness. the nightclub scenes look wonderful; one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time... the shooting/framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch.<br /><br />"descent" is good not great. however, i have a feeling, thanks to netflix, this movie will find a life of its own. i hope this group continues making films. if you're into experimental american film-making, cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs (or male model drop-outs) in their early twenties, or if you're an undergraduate, just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your american university, "rosario dawson's descent" might be your flavor of rockaroll.
