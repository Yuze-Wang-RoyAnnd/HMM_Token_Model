edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this movie.<br /><br />this is the typical "alternative" or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important.<br /><br />pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in. suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and more.<br /><br />but pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the town's people who are pecker's main inspiration. even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the "adequate" attention to her.<br /><br />well this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone. it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something "different" than hollywood's typical standards.<br /><br />to describe in a few words: this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie. that's it.<br /><br />oh and i almost forgot to mention that the "full of grace" lines are really annoying. geez.
