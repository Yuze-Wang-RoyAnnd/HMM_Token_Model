this is real character and story driven drama at a level that shames most of what we see on tv at the mo.<br /><br />i was impressed right from the start. don't be put off if your not a sci fi nut (like me...) this could be happening on earth, the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. there are no space ships or laser guns (none yet anyway) so far i've seen up to s01 e04 and i'm gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities.<br /><br />the cast play there roles with pasion. eric stoltz is especially strong.<br /><br />this show really stands alone well, it doesn't matter if you watched bsg or not, in fact they are quite different. i've read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but i would say ignore them.<br /><br />this is a really positive start to a show. lets hope they don't cann it after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days.
