the odd couple (3+ outta 5 stars)<br /><br />like most people i will always feel that jack klugman and tony randall are the definitive "odd couple". their incredible work on the tv series from the early to mid-70s was a highwater mark for television at the time... easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale. nonetheless, how can you go wrong with a jack lemmon/walter matthau pairing? matthau is in especially good form as oscar, the slob. lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as felix, particularly if you have previously seen tony randall's outstanding performance. the script is good... definitely neil simon's best. (i will go on record here as stating that neil simon is probably one of the worst, most over-rated playwrights of american theatre.) the storyline is simple: felix, a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with oscar, the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments. their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well, culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats. lots of fun and some great one-liners.
