reed hadley makes a better foppish don diego than he does a dashing and daring zorro, but that's almost beside the point because this serial features the bar-none best theme song of any serial, ever -- and the best version of yakima canutt's famous stagecoach stunt. there are other good stunts, and lots of action, and plenty of hair-raising cliff-hanger chapter endings, but if for no other reason, you must see this film to watch the stagecoach stunt, then re-watch it in slow motion. it is incredible, and, despite the lower budget for this chapter play, yak turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film "stagecoach." indiana jones, eat your heart out: this is the real deal!
