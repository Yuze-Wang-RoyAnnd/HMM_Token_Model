it' just funny, watch it!!! <br /><br />ok they want 10 lines so there: this is a spoof of 50s/70s werewolf movies. lots of satire, some political. feels like an early clouseau movie (probably due to alan arkin), but with less slap stick. if you like the naked guns movies you'll like this too (once again less slapstick in this one). <br /><br />actually, the humor ranges from light sexual innuendo (unavoidable in a teen comedy), to really poignant socio-political satire. the transformation of the moon high school from 50s to 70s is really funny. the sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious. there are tons of (histarical) cracks starting from the 50s cold war paranoia and the late 70s inflation.<br /><br />anyway, just watch the movie if you get a chance!
