many of the american people would say...what??? to my opening comment. yes i know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the master akira kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right. we have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village. the great difference is the way that the story takes. our samurais, a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs, heroes. please watch again this incredible movie (the seven samurai, obviously) and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the masterpiece of akira kurosawa. a tip is the 13th warrior with antonio banderas, michael crichton copied the story to wrote his best seller's, but he didn't found the third foot of the cat.
