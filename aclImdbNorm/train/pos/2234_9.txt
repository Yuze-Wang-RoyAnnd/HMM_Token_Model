while the 'special effects' and technical attributes of this movie may in fact be laughable to some, i have never been able to erase the images this movie etched on my young and impressionable mind when i first saw it at around 8 years of age. the story of this girl's survival and of the trials she endured have stayed with me all these years, and i have thought back on more than one occasion about how the girl made it out of situations far beyond anything i have seen.<br /><br />the fact that this is a true story, and the fact that i was only a child when i first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie. each time this movie aired on television in the 70s and 80s i would be riveted to the television, drinking in each scene with an interest i cannot explain. i suppose watching this for the first time as an adult (and with a jaded view of the world) it may not be as enjoyable to some. i actually went out of my way to obtain a copy so i could show this movie to my son.<br /><br />this, like many other movies, is not for everyone. if you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories, are partial to peru/macchu picchu and/or the amazon, then i believe you might enjoy this movie as much as i have been enjoying it for the past 30 years.
