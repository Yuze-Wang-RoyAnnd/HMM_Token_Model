what a pleasant surprise: a disney dtv (direct to video) sequel that's actually good. "the lion king 1 1/2" is a comedy affair that involves everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog, timon and pumbaa. it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments, until timon complains that "we're not here yet". after fighting over the remote, timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience "their story". they start the new movie, and the laughs begin.<br /><br />to be honest, i was losing hope in disney. most of their direct-to-video fare has been aggressively awful, with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: it tells the original story from a new point of view. okay, it adds some stuff, like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. nathan lane and ernie sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie. there's also some neat movie parodies (including one scene that simultaneously spoofs 'the good, the bad, and the ugly' and 'cool hand luke), and the script is filled with funny memorable lines.<br /><br />added to the cast are julie kavner ("the simpsons") as timon's worry-wart mom, and jerry stiller as timon's slightly crazy uncle max. matthew broderick shows up as simba, and his "teen" scene reminded me of ferris bueller. everyone does well, especially robert guillame (is that how you spell it?) as rafiki, who exudes more and more yoda-speak in this movie (timon comments on this several times).<br /><br />'the lion king 1 1/2' is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the shrekification of animation. 10/10
