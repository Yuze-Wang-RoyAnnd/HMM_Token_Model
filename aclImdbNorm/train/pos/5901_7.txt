it's a rehash of many recent films only this one has fewer stars, lesser complications and a more fuzzy feel to it. abhay and ritika (played by fardeen khan & esha deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage (unbeknowst to them) begins its process of being arranged. within no time the two strangers are married and sent of to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples going through the motions similar to theirs. as they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and/or mended and love blossoms.<br /><br />if you've seen honeymoon private limited and/or salaam-e-ishq, then you've seen this film. the plot twists are the same, there is not a single element of surprise in the entire two and a half hours of the film. everything is predictable. i only enjoyed it because i had seen 'darling' (also starring the leads deol & khan) earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry in that so i said "why not" when my sister suggested we rent 'just married' as well.<br /><br />see it: because kirron kher co-stars and is her usual darling self in it.<br /><br />skip it: because you've had enough of all this couple-fest nonsense! <br /><br />c+
