what is so taboo about love?! people seem to have major problems with the transgenered.<br /><br />the title of this movie didn't catch my eye. it was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing. i could not believe how freaking amazing this film was. it touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way. it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen. i did not view these characters as either gender, just human. i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. especially independent films. praise to all fearless filmmakers!
