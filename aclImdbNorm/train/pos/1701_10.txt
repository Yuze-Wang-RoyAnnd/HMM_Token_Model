this is a thinking man's silly movie. if you don't expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i - from casting the "voice" of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either way.<br /><br />it's not for everyone, but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie.
