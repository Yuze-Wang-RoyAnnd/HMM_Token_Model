i lived during those times and i think the program caught the heart of the era. i do think it should have dealt with more of the afro american issue but i think it cover a lot in the program. it was scary to sit and watch the riots on t v hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down. i thought jerry o'connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war. i went to school with guys who came back. some had changed more than others and some not so much. it bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough. live through it and then make comments. i thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job. thank you for a trip (sad and good) down memory lane.
