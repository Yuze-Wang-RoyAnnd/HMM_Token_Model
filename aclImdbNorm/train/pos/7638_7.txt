larry burrows has the distinct feeling he's missing out on something. ever since he missed a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship, he's been convinced his life would have turned out better had he made that shot. then one night his car breaks down again. walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck, larry happens upon barman mike, who unbeknown to larry is about to change his life for ever.......<br /><br />the alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing, stretching back to the likes of it's a wonderful life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent sandler vehicle that was click. it's a genre that has produced very mixed results. back in 1990 was this james belushi led production, rarely mentioned when the said topic arises, it appears that it has largely been forgotten. which is a shame since it oozes charm and is not short in the humour department. we know that we are being led to its ultimate message come the end, but it's a fun and enjoyable path to be led down. the film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor james belushi was. i mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation isn't your thing,? then chances are you would avoid this film anyway. but for those engaged by the likes of red heat, k-9 and taking care of business, well mr. destiny is right up your street. along for the ride are linda hamilton, michael caine, jon lovitz, hart bochner, jay o. sanders, rene russo and courteney cox.<br /><br />mr. destiny, pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart. 7/10
