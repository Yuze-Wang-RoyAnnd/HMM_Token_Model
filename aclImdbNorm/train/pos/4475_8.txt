the united states was still fighting world war ii (the movie was released in between ve day and vj day). any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless american soldiers beat the enemy, or americans in general were singing and dancing. technicolor musicals were what america thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed. most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number! i get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970. depressing how quickly we forget.<br /><br />this film could've been called "the search for jose iturbi" but now everyone wonders why. allow me to explain. from 1929--his arrival in america--until his death in 1980, iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage. he agreed to do a few movies in 1942, but hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time. not only an excellent pianist, but a successful conductor as well, iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years. <br /><br />the scene where iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of liszt's rhapsodies was planned early on--and hasn't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children? joe pasternak, who produced that movie & many other mgm musicals, credited iturbi with interesting america's youth in classical music. grayson's wanting an audition with iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time. everyone wanted iturbi back then. the joke among soldiers was that "gi" meant "get iturbi" (he did a lot of concerts at military bases).<br /><br />gene kelly was a great dancer and frank sinatra an excellent singer, but at the time this movie was made sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to columbia records for four years. kelly was already well-known as a dancer, but iturbi had by then been a world-wide sensation for 20+ years.<br /><br />and as to the lack of a plot, americans didn't need plot. they were tired of war, they were sick with fear for their loved ones, and worried about the future. they needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end. they needed music and smiles and joy and romance. this movie and others like it delivered just what was needed.<br /><br />enough lecturing. mouse dancing aside, the best scene in the movie occurs between sinatra and iturbi with each of them "ignorantly" complimenting the other's music.<br /><br />if you have any interest in jose iturbi, the spaniard who conquered more of america than de soto, cortez, and de leon put together, please drop by my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a plot summary, excerpts from movie reviews "of the day" and pictures from this and certain other mgm musicals of the 1940's, as well as a biography and discography of iturbi.<br /><br />trout
