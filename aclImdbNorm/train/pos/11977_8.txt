ok. who brought the cheese. i love it. during it's run it became a phenomenon. the anorexic twins became popular.bob saget started making a paycheck (instead of his really funny stand-up). and people knew who dave coulier was. this is when life was good and simple. this is one of the great american classics. it was humorous and always brought home a good lesson. and this is where i differ from the norm: i liked the last few seasons. like home improvement, when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script. this is why i dare say...it could have gone much later than it did. but anyway. i gave it an 8/10 because of its wholesome, funny story lines, and because of bob saget!
