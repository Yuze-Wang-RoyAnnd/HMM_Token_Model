i can not quite understand why any of the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0" other than for political reasons. no, the film did not investigate both "sides" of the story, but then surely one film in favour of chavez against the tides of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance out the narrative overall (especially given a. the history of cia involvement in latin america in fermenting civil unrest - google national security archive and b. the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly faked scenes of chavez supporters shooting non-existent opponents). what is most amazing about this film is the fact that the film makers stayed in the presidential palace all of the way though the coup - surely a first in documentary making - images of a coup from both sides!!!
