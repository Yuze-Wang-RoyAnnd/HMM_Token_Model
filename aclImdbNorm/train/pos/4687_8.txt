lizzie borden's love crimes is an important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity, which sure beats the male kind). it flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory.<br /><br />this treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky, but borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust.<br /><br />one striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse. he shoves a riding crop between her legs, pressing it against her crotch, and this greatly increases her excitement.<br /><br />then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door.<br /><br />patrick bergin plays the con artist, and though he falls a long distance from handsome, he picks on plain janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line. by all reports, sean young proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful. yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination. her performance is forceful and complex.<br /><br />borden possesses an intriguing worldview, and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist i truly appreciate.
