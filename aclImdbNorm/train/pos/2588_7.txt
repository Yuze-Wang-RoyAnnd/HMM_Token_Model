brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not just for debra winger's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers.<br /><br />there are surreal touches (the fire brigade that act like a singing greek chorus), but there is also humour and romance. the soundtrack is great similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~ and i don't think i'll ever forget dennis quaid (mmmmm dennis quaid), setting his own trailer a rockin' to 'she's a lady' ~ priceless ;)<br /><br />best line missing from the quotes section btw ~ 'once you've had a clown, you never go back!'<br /><br />i love this movie (i ordered the dvd from the us) and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with legally blond 3 don't put you off ~ give it a try :)
