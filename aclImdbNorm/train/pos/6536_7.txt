let's face it; nancy drew was never great literature. it is in the same category as babysitter club, magic tree house, goosebumps, abc mysteries. in fact, it was one of the original formula stories. nancy is perfect, pretty, thoughtful, "nice", has no internal conflicts ever! and never changes. ned is pretty much the same. the movie was true to that style and i have to say, i liked it. it will never be a great movie, but it had a that same nostalgic flavor that the books held. it had just the right amount of suspense for my children (8 and 10.) there was almost no offensive language. i liked the push for more conservative dress.<br /><br />corky was a bit of an annoyance. he was a little out of place on a high school campus. i never quite got why he was there in the first place.
