i'm not at all picky about horror movies, and i'm willing to watch pretty much any of them. that doesn't mean that i'm willing to re-watch many of them, or that i won't have criticism for them. this movie is creepy, and is very well done. in fact, i think this movie would make an excellent double-bill with session 9.<br /><br />i should specify, before i get to my comments, that i watched this alone. i started watching it before going to bed, and got about 15 minutes in before i realized that it was too effective, so i saved the rest of it for the morning. even while watching it in broad daylight, it was still creepy. however, i can't vouch for how effective it would be when watching in a larger group.<br /><br />after the death of their daughter, a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death. let me make note of this death - this is one of the rare movies that doesn't shy away from the death of a child. this is much more important, as it both sets the tone, as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the movie.<br /><br />the couple is not doing well. the wife has distanced herself from the relationship, and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back. while some of the comments have complained about their acting - one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife, and that's legitimate. he's trying to give her more direction. it's a role that men sometimes take on.<br /><br />there are a variety of scares in the film, and most are fairly non-violent, though grotesque in some ways. the story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film, and takes an odd turn near the end. while the turn is not absurd, it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressing.<br /><br />moody, atmospheric, and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video.
