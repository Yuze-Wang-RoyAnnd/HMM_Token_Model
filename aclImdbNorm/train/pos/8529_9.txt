i ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off. peter sellers plays an unlikable fellow who falls for an extremely warm and cute goldie hawn (who wouldn't?). the way that goldie's character holds herself from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today. this movie gave me a different angle into human relations and also i found it very funny. peter sellers role was a difficult sell, but i think he pulls it off well.
