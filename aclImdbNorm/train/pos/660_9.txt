9/10- 30 minutes of pure holiday terror. okay, so it's not that scary. but it sure is fun.<br /><br />the crypt keeper (john kassir) tales a tale of holiday fear, giving us all christmas goose... gossebumps that is. bwahahahahha. you should really be careful what you axe santa for. have a scary christmas and a happy new fear. okay i'll stop.<br /><br />okay, so in the story, a greedy wife (best screamer in the world, mary ellen trainor) kills her husband (marshall bell, the coach who gets towel whipped to death in anoes 2) for the money. but, her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a santa suit (larry "dr. giggles" drake) comes her way.<br /><br />if you look it up on youtube, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third viewing). but if you haven't seen it, i suggest you do.
