my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970's. we absolutely adored it. there was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual american re-runs (petticoat junction, green acres... you get the idea). it had a similar feel to the avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also british and in the spy/adventure genre).<br /><br />i would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up. i've mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so i began to wonder if i'd imagined its whole existence. but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.
