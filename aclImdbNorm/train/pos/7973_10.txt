maybe i'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever! i saw it for the first time when i was around 4 or 5, and i cried my eyes out. between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) i have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them. don't worry they're tears of happiness! and it's not all sap! there's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case. my only word of advice: even if you love this-don't see the sequal...cornyness! i suggest everyone checks this out...you won't be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!
