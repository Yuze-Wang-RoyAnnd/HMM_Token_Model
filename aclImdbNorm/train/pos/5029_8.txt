i went into this movie perhaps a bit jaded by the hack-and-slash films rampant on the screen these days. boy, was i surprised. this little treasure was pleasantly paced with a somber, dark atmosphere. more surprising yet was the very limited amount of blood actually shown. as with most good movies, this one leaves something to the imagination, and bill paxton did a superb job at directing. scenes shot inside the car as are well done and, after watching the "anatomy of a scene" episode at the end of the video tape, it was good to see that some of the subtle, yet wonderful things i had noticed were intentional and not just an "oh, that looks good, keep it" type of direction. this is a moody movie, filled with grimness. still, for the dark subject, a considerable portion of it is filmed in daylight, even some of the more disturbing scenes. the acting is exceptional (okay, i've always been a fan of powers booth), and never goes over the top. au contraire, it is very subdued which works extremely well for this type of film. if there is any one area where this film lacks, it is in the ending, which seems just a bit too contrived, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie. what is the message? it's something that each individual decides for themself. overall, on the 1-10 scale, this movie scores an 8 for those who like the southern gothic genre (ie: "body heat" or "midnight in the garden of good and evil"), and about a 5 for those who don't.
