great movie, enough laughs and action for any audience.<br /><br />since the last person who posted on this movie took it upon themselves to call woody allen incestuous and not comment on the film, here i am.<br /><br />the film follows an unlikely duo, johansson and allen, as they follow a tip given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased english reporter. their search takes them into the home of the killer, and eventually to a somewhat tragic end. but don't let the plot fool you, the film truly is hilarious and the acting is superb.<br /><br />it seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right. clint eastwood, allen and pollack all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers. also, from watching the movie in a pact theater, you can just tell that people really love woody allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback. the second he walked on screen audience lit up. there's just something about the man and he really shines in scoop. <br /><br />check it out, it's worth the trip.
