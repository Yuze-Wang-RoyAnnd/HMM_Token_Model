this movie is excellent and i would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it. or, even better, you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over. i can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then. but after watching it again yesterday i've found it to be amazing.<br /><br />a good blend of comedy (although not as great as "mr magoo"-another one of my favorites) and action. this deserves 10/10 and i'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon (fingers crossed). if you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then i'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours :).
