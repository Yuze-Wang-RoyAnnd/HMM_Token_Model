karen goes into a japanese house as a substitute nurse to emma, a strange woman who sleeps at day and wakes at night. karen goes upstairs after hearing noises when she encounters a frightening ghost. she will learn the house's secrets.<br /><br />it is very scary! the scenes are shocking and frightening! the characters are good. the settings are creepy. i love the whole plot! the ending was shocking! i paused at a scene where the little boy meowed so loudly to the man finding his sister upstairs and i was shocked. this is the scariest movie i have watched. i did not see the japanese version. i recommend this to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
