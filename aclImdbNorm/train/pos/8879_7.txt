*** spoilers *** <br /><br />this movie always seems very exaggerated, until i remember that my college campus had a former-student-turned-nazi-racist-killer-who-then-committed-suicide, too: his name was benjamin nathaniel smith.<br /><br />look him up in the wikipedia- i added a few photos to their article about him.<br /><br />it's hard to believe, but this stuff really does happen.<br /><br />i'm not a big fan of omar epps or ice cube, but larry fishburne, kristy swanson, jennifer connelly & mike rappaport were good.
