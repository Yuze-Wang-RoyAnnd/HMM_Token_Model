an axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first. <br /><br />once again, the casting is just wonderful. i like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness.<br /><br />the second episode is just very funny, very silly and very enjoyable. it is the very first christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband. just like the first episode; karma.<br /><br />the most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
