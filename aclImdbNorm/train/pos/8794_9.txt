chang cheh's "shaolin temple" might very well be the highwater mark of the shaw brothers martial arts film cycle. this rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a veritable who's who of the shaw stable. though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual, it is cheh's handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable. the sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the shaolin temple is palpable in every frame. not unlike william keighley's paean to the fabled fighting 69th in that same self titled film or john ford's salute to west point in "the long gray line," cheh's "shaolin temple" is a lovingly crafted ode in that same style.<br /><br />the cultural correlation i am tempted to make, is to compare the shaolin temple to the alamo. watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the alamo. at the end of the film, you too might be tempted to call out, remember the shaolin temple!
