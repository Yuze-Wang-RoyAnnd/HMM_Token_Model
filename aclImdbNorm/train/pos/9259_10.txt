it was simple and yet so nice. i think the whole sense of sex segregation in society, which can be bitter, was shown very delicately. it had a bitter kind of hummer in it. the fact that most of the actors were not professionals, made the movie more tangible and more realistic. there was a "documentary" side to the movie too. the best scenes were those that all the girls, banned from watching, were listening passionately to the soldier, who is supposed to keep an eye on them, broadcasting the game. if you are an iranian, the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won, fills you up with national pride!! if you are not iranian, you'll still love it all the same!
