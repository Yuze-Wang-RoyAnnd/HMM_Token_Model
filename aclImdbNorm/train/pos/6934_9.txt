winchester '73 is a great story, and that's what i like about it. it's not your everyday western--it uses a rifle, which passes hands from various characters--as a mechanism for telling the story about these people. rock hudson plays an indian chief, jimmy stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength, and shelly winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west. it's important to note for those politically correct types--they kill a lot of indians in this movie without remorse. by today's standards, it's still pretty violent. but it's a great story and worth watching. enjoy!
