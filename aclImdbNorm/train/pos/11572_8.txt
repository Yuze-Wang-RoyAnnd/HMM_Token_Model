"in april 1946, the university of chicago agreed to operate argonne national laboratory, with an association of midwestern universities offering to sponsor the research. argonne thereby became the first "national" laboratory. it did not, however, remain at its original location in the argonne forest. in 1947, it moved farther west from the "windy city" to a new site on illinois farmland. when alvin weinberg visited argonne's director, walter zinn, in 1947, he asked him what kind of reactor was to be built at the new site. when zinn described a heavy-water reactor operating at one-tenth the power of the materials testing reactor under design at oak ridge, weinberg joked it would be simpler if zinn took the oak ridge design and operated the materials testing reactor at one-tenth capacity. the joke proved unintentionally prophetic."<br /><br />the s-50 plant used convection to separate the isotopes in thousands of tall columns. it was built next to the k-25 power plant, which provided the necessary steam. much less efficient than k-25, the s-50 plant was torn down after the war.<br /><br />concerned that the atomic energy commission research program might become too academic, lilienthal established a committee of industrial advisers, and during a november visit to oak ridge, he discussed with clark center, manager of carbide & carbon, a subsidiary of union carbide corporation at oak ridge, the possibility of the company assuming management of the laboratory.<br /><br />prince henry (of prussia) arriving in washington and visiting the german embassy (1902). evidently, with prince henry of prussia according to the principles of science and its dangers their were already concerns with the applications of new science with military applications. the hohenzollern (1902/ii), "kaiser wilhelm's splendid yacht at the 34th st. pier, new york. taken at the exact moment of prince henry's arrival, and the raising of the royal standard." if royalty knew of these necessary precautions to citizen welfare then what was the necessity of the warfare wwi and wwii. the quality of management control i presume?<br /><br />thus, did the commandos of operation swallow volunteer for a military mission, or a business plan, based on the security principles of laboratory management? because supposedly their were no survivors, and the ones who were caught in europe ordered to be executed. of the 400 man commando team the survivors who were captured were executed under orders of the german army against subversion, and espionage acts of the state of germany. <br /><br />the f"uhrer no. 003830/42 g. kdos. okw/wfst, f"uhrer hq, 18 oct. 1942, (signed) adolph hitler; translation of document no. 498-ps, office of u.s. chief of counsel, certified true copy kipp major, declassified dod 5200.30 march 23, 1983, reproduced at the u.s. national archives.<br /><br />the oss society(r) 6723 whittier ave., 200 mclean, va 22101
