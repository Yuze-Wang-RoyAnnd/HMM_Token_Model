i don't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of " tetsuo " or not . why " tetsuo " ? because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious " tetsuo " rip - off . the concept is similar , editing is equally frantic and fast - which is good because , aside from making the movie more dynamic , it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors .<br /><br />there is lot more gore , less eroticism and , in the case of " meatball machine " , the transformation of human being into a creature that's partially a machine( sounds familiar ? ) called " necroborg " ( very original ) is caused by slimy little aliens .<br /><br />these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other . they infest the body , somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs . their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg , rip it out of the corpse and eat it .<br /><br />all in all , the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn't expect much , but at the end i actually enjoyed this film .<br /><br />as i said before , this is a low budget flick , but it's still relatively decent . don't expect much from actors , they're mostly not very good , but it can be tolerated . i liked the atmosphere and gore , certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited . although the story is not too original , it possesses certain charm - to me at least .<br /><br />7 out of 10 .
