i so love this movie! the animation is great (for a pok'emon movie), the cgi looks so awesome. i love the music in the movie. so great they kept the japanese music.<br /><br />as for the story: its great. it has a great feeling of friendship. celebi is a very cute and powerful pok'emon. ash is really great in this movie, and i like his friendship with sam. the only thing i didn't like was suicune's appearance, he just suddenly pops up, helps ash & co a bit and leaves. they could have made his part in the movie a little bigger.<br /><br />but overall, awesome movie! can't wait to own the usa version on dvd!
