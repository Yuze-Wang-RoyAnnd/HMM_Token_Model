damn, i've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and i still don't get bored watching it.<br /><br />the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing to me.<br /><br />the cgis are quite bad imho, but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just... just a genius perfect combination for such a movie. the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good.<br /><br />however although, the movie had little flaws, like e.g. sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too "slow", but i don't mean the scenic parts by that, i totally loved those.<br /><br />also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story, like when he is in the underground bunker-like thing of digicorps, where all their data is saved, and has this conversation with the guy down there... but that may also just be me :d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized, they should have made the getting-back-true-memory-part a bit longer and "louder" but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again...
