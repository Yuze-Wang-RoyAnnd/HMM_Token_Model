jane porter's former love interest harry holt(neil hamilton) and his friend martin (paul cavanagh) come to tarzan's hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the "elephant's graveyard" first seen in tarzan, the ape man...only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions...namely jane. will tarzan stand for that? not likely (in fact tarzan won't even stand for any disturbance done to the "elephant's graveyard") and knowing this martin attempts to take tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party (including jane who leaves with them after she believes tarzan is dead)is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions..will tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time?<br /><br />this film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer's interest and doesn't let up. the cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn't be taken so seriously.
