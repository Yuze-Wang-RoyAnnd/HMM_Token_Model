i think this still is the best routine. there are some others, like rock's "bring the pain", and allen's "men are pigs" that are hilarious; "damon waynes last stand" is also funny in a tearful way - but this routine has no errors. all the jokes are funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect. just long enough to last 20 years. i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. i'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool. not putting in a category with ellen and newhart, but something you can watch if you're bloated. thanks eddie, god bless.
