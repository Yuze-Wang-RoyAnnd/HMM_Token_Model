in stand by me, vern and teddy discuss who was tougher, superman or mighty mouse. my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too. sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix. but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan, bruce lee and jet li. it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead, but it is a fun one. and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask, you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan. in this film he comes across as a martial arts god.<br /><br />black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men, to be supreme fighting machines. their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose. they are invincible in some ways. now that is the premise for the film, but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes.<br /><br />jet li is a marvel. he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do. and that is what makes watching him so fun.<br /><br />besides the martial arts in the film, black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co-star, the police officer. they are great together. but to be honest. if anyone is reading this review, they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department. and the answer to that is a resounding yes!!! lots and lots of gory mindless action. you will love this film.
