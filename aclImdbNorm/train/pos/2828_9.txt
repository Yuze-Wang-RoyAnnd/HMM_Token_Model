after tracking it down for half a year, i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing.<br /><br />not disappointing because i'm one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro. but i couldn't believe goro was forced to make a movie as such. in his respectable self now, i'm sure he cringes that he made this movie. nevertheless, they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.<br /><br />man, i still can't believe he made this movie...i had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie....hahahaha....<br /><br />but i'm glad to have watched it. thank goodness he has grown up....
