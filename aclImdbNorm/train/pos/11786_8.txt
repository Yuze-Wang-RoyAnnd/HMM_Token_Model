this is almost typical lynch. however, what makes this film slightly unusual for lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. but i believe lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments.<br /><br />however, a lot of typical lynch motifs are present, such as: floating camera work; haunting music; long (excruciating) pauses; hanging curtains; dim lights growing darker at a slow (almost indiscernible) pace; extreme close ups; themes of women in trouble; over-bearing, incompassionate, all knowing characters facing off with characters who are distraught, temporarily oblivious, in the dark and so on...<br /><br />the performances are great and the short is thought provoking. as usual, lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation. many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination.<br /><br />another brilliant effort from lynch. i only hope he makes some shorts, more along the lines of his sony playstation 2 commercials. they were inspired.
