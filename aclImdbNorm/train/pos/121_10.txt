critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films. europa is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. the back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters, and the focus of the conversation they are having. other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect, again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions.<br /><br />i could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own, and really heighten the drama of the film. a film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not.<br /><br />10/10 don't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors.
