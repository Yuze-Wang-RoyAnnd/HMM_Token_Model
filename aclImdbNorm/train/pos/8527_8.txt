allow me to just get to the bottom line here: i've got 3 kids, ages 5 to 10. i consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals. i've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. i can tell you when the film gets reversed in the wizard of oz, the over-18 sexual joke in el dorado and the tragic flaw with the ending of rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. i could probably storyboard nemo from memory alone.<br /><br />what makes me support the one child of mine (it varies) who suggests this title for the family movie of an evening? in a word: showerman.<br /><br />moment of silence...<br /><br />*sigh*
