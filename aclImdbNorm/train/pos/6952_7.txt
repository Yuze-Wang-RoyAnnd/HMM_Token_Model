in new york, when the shy and lonely project manager of a design firm matt saunders (luke wilson) meets jenny johnson (uma thurman) in the subway, he invites her to date and have dinner with him. jenny immediately falls in love for him, they have sex and she discloses her true identity to him, telling that she is the powerful superhero g-girl. after meeting his co-worker and friend hannah lewis (anna faris), the needy jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and matt follows the advice of his best friend vaughn haige (rainn wilson) and dumps her, breaking her heart. jenny turns matt's life into hell, while he has a romance with hannah. however, the archenemy of g-girl and former high school sweetheart of jenny, professor bedlam (eddie izzard), proposes matt to lure jenny to strip her superpowers.<br /><br />"my super ex-girlfriend" is delightfully silly and funny. this romantic comedy-adventure has many hilarious moments and is very entertaining. luke wilson is great in the role of an idiot, anna farris is extremely sexy as usual, and uma thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero that recalls glenn close in "fatal attraction" or evelyn draper in "play misty for me". my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "minha super ex-namorada" ("my super ex-girlfriend")
