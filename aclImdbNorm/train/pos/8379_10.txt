i remember this movie from when i was 12, it was amazing.. i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then, i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sh*t! anyway, the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real b movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch, i must have watched it about 20 times. it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots, pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off "crash and burn", don't watch that movie by the way it is total pants! if your a real sci-fi movie fan then watch this, if it was re-made today it would be a winner.. i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it.
