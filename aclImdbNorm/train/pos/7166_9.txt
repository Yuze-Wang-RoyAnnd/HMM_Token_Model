holes, the novel, was forced on me in an education course. i didn't think i would like a children's novel; plus, the other couple of books i was forced to read for the class were really bad. but, to my surprise, i absolutely loved holes. it really is one of the most perfectly written novels i've ever read. i think it has the rare quality that makes it appeal to pre-teens, teenagers, and adults. everyone who reads it, i think, will walk away a better person. while i can't quite say that for the film, i am happy to say that they got it mostly right. i don't think viewers of the film will walk away as enriched, but they will certainly be entertained, without the side effect of being stupider when they sat down. it is an intelligent story, and it's very well told. i think it moves a tad too quickly. the novel takes more time in developing the characters. and the flashbacks come in and out so quickly that they don't have too much time to register. the interracial romance in the past feels more clich'e and trite than it does in the novel. and the ending, which ties together all the loose threads, seems very ridiculous. it's exactly the same in the novel, but there's a sense of the absurd that doesn't quite exist in the film. it works a lot better. i also don't like the multitude of pop songs. i wish disney didn't feel it such a necessity to sell soundtracks. the cast is across-the-board excellent, from the young kids to the old pros. jon voight is especially great. not quite sure why we need catwoman and the fonze, though. 9/10.
