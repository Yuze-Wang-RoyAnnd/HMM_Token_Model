at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that jon bon jovi delivers a firm, strong, seamless performance as derek bliss. his capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films (the leading man, no looking back). but, in case anyone is still wondering, yes, jon bon jovi can act. he can act well and that's come to be expected of him. it's easy to separate derek from the guy who belts out hits on vh-1.<br /><br />i generally would not watch a horror movie. i've come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot. what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along. the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets. so, gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not.<br /><br />unlike an action film like u-571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast, we get a chance to know "the good guys" and actually care what happens to them. a few scenes are left unexplained (like derek's hallucinations) but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel. unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film, that sequel will never happen. these few instances are forgiveable knowing that vampires could have been a continuing series.<br /><br />is this the best film i've ever seen in my life? no. is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained? yes. it won't leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it won't leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either. if you're somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover, this film is for you. it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other.<br /><br />
