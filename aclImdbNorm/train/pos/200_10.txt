updated from a previous comment. the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines. davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines, a bit player in crude comedies. they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star.<br /><br />a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretensions. davies & haines are a wonderful team, and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin, douglas fairbanks, william s. hart, john gilbert, elinor glyn, norma talmadge, mae murray, rod larocque, leatrice joy, dorothy sebastian, estelle taylor, louella parsons, renee adoree, aileen pringle, and marion davies (you have to see it) are a hoot. a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies! dell henderson plays the father. polly moran is a maid. paul ralli is the slimy leading man.<br /><br />show people was said to have used the career of gloria swanson as its model (i think mae murray is closer). davies and swanson were friends. but this film's story does parallel the rise of swanson from one-reel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b. demille films of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br />davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends. odd that mgm never teamed them up in a talkie. they're great together! a sweet romance and delightful spoof of early hollywood. greta garbo and bebe daniels are mentioned but do not appear.
