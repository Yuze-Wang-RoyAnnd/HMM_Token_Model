i noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and i too didn't have high hopes for it. i figured it was another "you got served" type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting. i was at the theater and deciding between this and meet the spartans and picked this. to my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good. the fact that it has a lower rating than you got served is absolutely ridiculous. instead of listening to the garbage posted on here i recommend going to see a matin'ee showing of this movie so you don't spend too much. i think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it. when it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones. go see the movie and judge for yourself. hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on dvd and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released.<br /><br />edit the movie is now moving closer to its correct rating. over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9, a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1.
