this movie is ridiculous! that's exactly what i like about this piece of "guilty pleasure". it is easy to condemn this movie for not including pat priest and butch patrick, the original marilyn and eddie. but look at the year and do the math. pat priest and butch patrick had long outgrown their parts! time does that to young stars. yvonne de carlo, who re-prised her role as lili, was pushing the big 6-0 (even though she still looked good and was still the perfect "lili").<br /><br />it's a shame that yvonne de carlo wasn't given a larger part. still, it was good to see fred gwynne and al lewis in the roles that made them so famous! during the 2 seasons that the munsters was on prime time, it was the gwynne/lewis chemistry that made the series such a success. the rest of the cast were supporting cast members, not to say that they weren't needed. they were! the tv series wouldn't had survived as long as it did without them. given the choice between butch patrick or happy derman (the original "eddie"), the choice was too easy. yvonne de carlo was also the better choice over joan marshall.<br /><br />though this movie doesn't measure up to the original tv series, it still measures up nicely and is one of the better "reunuin" tv specials that plagued the boob-tube during the late 1970s/early 1980s.<br /><br />'
