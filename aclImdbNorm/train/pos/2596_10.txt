the film adaptation of james joyce's ulysses is excellent. the actors, the voice overs, the direction, it all captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merits. the milo o'shea does an excellent job as leopold bloom, the cuckolded man married to the sassy molly. i absolutely love this picture.
