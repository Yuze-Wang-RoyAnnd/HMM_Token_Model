you spend most of this two-hour film wondering "what's the story regarding the lead character?" <br /><br />will smith, as a low-key "ben thomas" will keep you guessing. the last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shocker....but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. until then, smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. you know he has a good reason for doing it, but it's never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end.<br /><br />all of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with rosario dawkins ("emily posa") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....but don't because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together.<br /><br />this is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho will smith film. in fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of smith throughout this story. it almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots. he looks like he's lost weight and is sick. smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness.<br /><br />like a good movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits.
