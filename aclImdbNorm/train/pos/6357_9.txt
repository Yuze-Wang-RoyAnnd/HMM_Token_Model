i found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand. a few things are inappropriate for the kiddies, but just a few. othewise, "the grinch" (jim carrey) cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all, ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-hollywood to racial.<br /><br />the film is very colorful and looks great on dvd. the little girl in here, "cindy lou who" (taylor momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view. anthony hopkins' voice is pleasing, too, so having his narrate this elevates the movie further. his rhymes are fun to hear.<br /><br />i saw this in the theater, though it was "fair," but on dvd, it was far better. i've seen in three times and it got better each time.
