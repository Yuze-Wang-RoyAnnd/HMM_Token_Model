your average garden variety psychotic nutcase (deliciously essayed with unhinged glee by stephen sachs) knocks off various dim-witted young "adults" (to use the term very loosely) in dayton hall university, which is being closed down for demolition. featuring dreadful acting by the entire cast (daphne zuniga makes her ignominious and inauspicious film debut here as debbie, a bimbo who has her head crushed by a car!), a hefty corpse tally of 10, okay make-up f/x by matthew mungle, a few bloody murders (baseball bat bludgeoning, chicken wire strangulation, your standard drill through the head bit, that sort of gruesome thing), a downbeat surprise twist ending which was later copied in "intruder," a creepy score by christopher ("hellraiser") young, a slight smidgen of gratuitous female nudity, and endearingly incompetent direction by jeffrey obrow and steve carpenter (who also blessed us with "the power" and "the kindred"), this entertainingly abysmal slice'n'dice atrocity sizes up as a good deal of delectably dopey and drecky low-grade fun.
