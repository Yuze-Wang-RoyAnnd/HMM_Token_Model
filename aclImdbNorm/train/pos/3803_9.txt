what people fail to understand about this movie is that it isn't a beginning, middle, and end, it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long tv series. so remember that when you all talk about how the world wasn't explored enough. that was all done in the tv show.<br /><br />as great and stunning as the visuals are, i think the ***spoilers*** argument between lian-chu and gwizdo near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie. seeing characters i had followed through 26 episodes fight like that was agonizing, and seeing gwizdo walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while lian-chu sharpened his blade was almost tear-jerking. <br /><br />then we got a total contrast with lian-chu fighting these insanely awesome dragons (which had been featured before in the series) while gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill zoe. *shudder* i'm surprised that this particular scene hasn't been mentioned more in the warnings. any kid that has a lick of sense will be able to see that gwizdo wasn't himself and was fully intent on strangling that little girl. it was enough to bother me, and i'm 15.<br /><br />the world is amazing, the plot is a lot better than most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go. check it out. :)
