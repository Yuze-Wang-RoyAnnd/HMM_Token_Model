yes it was a little low budget, but this movie shows love! the only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to "waterworld" and though the plot was good, the film never really tapped into it's full potential! strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night.
