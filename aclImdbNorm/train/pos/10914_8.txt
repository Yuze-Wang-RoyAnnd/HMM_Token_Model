i've seen the thin man series -- powell and loy are definitely great, but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthur's chemistry in this flick. jean arthur shines when she looks at powell. there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them. this film may not have the wit of the thin man series, but undeniably makes up for it in charm. while i watched it, i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with arthur. my friends thought the same. this is one film where i wish i could step back in time (to schmooze and lock lips with powell!) there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks! powell's character, lawrence bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man." okay, this is sounding way too gushy, but i can't help myself.
