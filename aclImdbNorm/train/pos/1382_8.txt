not everything is said in this excellent first feature from c'eline sciamma. the friendship, the "wanting to fit in", the first sexual feelings... all this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming scenes.<br /><br />all three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way. it is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to, say, "thirteen", but a very worthwhile trip nonetheless.<br /><br />a must see, and please leave all american cinematographic preconceptions at he door. the soundtrack is a+ by the way.<br /><br />bon cin'ema !
