if the lion king was a disney version of hamlet, then the lion king 3: hakuna matata is a disney version of guildenstern and rosencrantz are dead. just like tom stoppard's beguiling film, we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original: timon, the meerkat with a penchant for breaking into song at the drop of a hat, and pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence issues. by following their story - rather than simba's - we get to see why all the animals bowed down as simba was presented from pride rock. we find out what made timon and pumbaa decide to follow simba back to pride rock to oust scar. and we find out how they dealt with the hyena's once and for all. nathan lane as timon gets most of the best jokes, but he is ably supported by ernie sabella as pumbaa. it is also good to hear matthew broderick and whoopi goldberg reprising their roles. julie kavner and jerry stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters: timon's mother and uncle. the only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device which doesn't always help to progress the story. having said that, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. with more laughs than any other third-in-a-disney-series movie, hakuna matata is worth watching - if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable.
