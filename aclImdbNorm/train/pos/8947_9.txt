kim novak's a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover, and james stewart's her choice. scintillating comedy of manners, from the broadway stage; shot by james wong howe in witch color, and performed by a sterling cast. ernie kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually dishevelled writer redlitch. i love this movie, though few others seem to. kim alone makes it a winner in my book. ha! my #5 film of 1958.
