this movie is really genuine and random. it's really hard to find movies like it in bunches of movies now in hollywood. i really enjoy watching this movie, i bought its dvd tuesday this week and i've watched it for 4 times. i love the spanglish accent of paz, it s just really cute as she is. and her acting and morgan's are so funny and natural.<br /><br />my movie taste might be really different from others but i have to say i really love this movie, the simple is the best!<br /><br />i've learned something more about life from this movie (well, or at least usa's life)... life is really random... sometimes, u meet someone, they pass by your life and be your friends coincidently, and u don't spend so much time with them, maybe just a while but u enjoy that ''while'' with them, and then u and them will never meet each other again, but the time u are together is really unforgettable. just keep those moments in your mind as grateful and nice memories...<br /><br />this movie might be cheap in the making price but its meanings are totally not cheap. i rarely can learn anything from movies, but this is an exception.
