at a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is overpowering fiction as we know it on the small and big screen, "apart from that" is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest, fresh and innovative in there presentation than i have ever seen before. the usual spoon feeding conventions are non existent in this film, leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments trickle one after the other on the screen. while watching the movie, and even upon post contemplation, it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that, performances. every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives. even so, "apart from that" does not feel like a documentary or reality television, but instead transcends into a category of its own, with its unique cinematography and direction. i look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors jennifer shainin and randy walker.<br /><br />this movie must be seen.
