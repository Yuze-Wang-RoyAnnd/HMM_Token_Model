lost is the best tv series there is.first of all,it has great actors and wonderful directing.the writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after season 3 the writing became highly complex.for instance,who is jacob?why are there polar bears on the island?what's the fog?how did the island disappear?who is richard alpert?a lot of people think that the writers are lost and that they have raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they can't explain.i believe these people are wrong.i have confidence in the writers.i think that if the mysteries are revealed from now all the charm of the series will be gone.anyway,lost is undeniably the greatest tv series and it will continue to be for a long time.
