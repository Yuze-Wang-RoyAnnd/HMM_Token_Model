this game ranks above all so far. i had the honor of playing mine on ps2 so the graphics were really good. the voice acting was above standard. the difficulty level is just right. wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion. the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn't expecting. the only rating this game deserves is great.
