a must see for anyone who loves photography. stunning and breathtaking,leaves you in ore. seen it twice once in a cinema and now on dvd. it holds up well on dvd but on the big screen this was something else.<br /><br />took my two daughters to see this and they loved it, my oldest cried at the end.but she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the video shop. its simple telling of a child's love for nature and in particular a fox is told well. in some ways it reminded me of the bear in its telling a story not documentary formate. which works for children very well. not being preached to is very important, you make your own mind up.<br /><br />but the star of this film is the cinematographers, how did they do what they did. amazing just amazing.
