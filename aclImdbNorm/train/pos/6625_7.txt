if you've ever seen the trailer for the film "the recruit" with colin farrell and al pacino, you'll never have to see that film. sadly, renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers.<br /><br />the story of renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher. the setting is a futuristic paris, and science fiction elements feature throughout. the special thing about renaissance, though, is its visual style, and not its story. renaissance is 3d computer animation, like final fantasy, but highly stylised into black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. the result looks stunning (although the problems of 3d animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to tome: slightly robotic movements, slightly wooden facial acting, etc) as a highly stylised, beautiful film noir, renaissance succeeds at stunning the audience, especially visually. the story and writing, though, are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals. it's not a bad story (and presumably, if you haven't seen the trailer, it's a lot more exciting than it was for me). but it is a story that isn't highly original, and verges on the corny. a few lines of dialogue were painfully corny, making the writing sound like a beginner's first efforts.<br /><br />i will definitely recommend renaissance to friends. it's unlike anything i've seen before, visually, and i believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience. it is also a watchable story, even if it isn't perfect.
