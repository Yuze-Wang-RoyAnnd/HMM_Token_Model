saw this at the hawaii film festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a q&a afterwards.<br /><br />i found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to harvey keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked.<br /><br />certainly reminiscent of cinema paradiso, it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in cuba. however, don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution, it's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous. many references to the directors obvious love of film history (a great "bicycle thief" homage") and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious.<br /><br />enjoy!
