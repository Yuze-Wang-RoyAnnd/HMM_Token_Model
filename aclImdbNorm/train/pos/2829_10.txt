without a doubt, private lessons ii is the greatest movie i have ever seen. a japanese import (poorly) translated into english, its a joy to watch. not much of it makes sense, but that doesn't matter. it's the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funny.<br /><br />the film is rare and unavailable on video, but i have caught it a couple of time late, late at night on pay cable. my taped copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as i slowly, person-by-person, introduce this film gem to the world.<br /><br />joanna pacula plays the tutor/lover to ken, our hero. (she apparently was just working for her check.) ken is played by goro inagaki, of the japanese pop band smap, who gives it his all and has great hair through out the movie. stacy edwards, of "in the company of men" fame, shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwards.<br /><br />it takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is. on repeating viewing you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of vases ken has in his house (at least 50) or that ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered husks of corn in the movie's finale.<br /><br />the movie is predictable, but highly quotable. my friends and i reenact entire scenes. yes, it sounds like we're lame losers and we are ... but we're lame losers who have seen "private lessons ii." be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie. you'll thank me for it.
