i hated the first episode of this show ( 'protesting hippies' ) so much in 1999 that i shunned the rest. however, when it came on 'the paramount comedy channel' i watched it in full and, to my surprise, found it absolutely hilarious ( motto: never judge a comedy series in its first week )! <br /><br />set in 1969, 'hippies' stars simon pegg as 'ray purbbs', editor of an 'oz'-like underground magazine called 'mouth'. his friends are the feminist jill, laid-back alex, and the half-wit hugo. back in the late '60's, there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young, that they could change the world through the printing of magazines nobody read. rather than sneering at the hippies' naivety, 'hippies' is affectionate towards it. arthur mathews' scripts cheekily parody a number of that era's icons - 'hair', 'woodstock', 'the graduate', even the infamous 'oz' obscenity trial of the early '70's. excellent performances from the cast; julian rhind-tutt's 'alex' strangely put me in mind of the richard o'sullivan character from 'man about the house'. its a shame that there was never a second series, possibly because of people like me. if you missed 'hippies', give it a try. once you get past the dire opener, you're in for a treat!
