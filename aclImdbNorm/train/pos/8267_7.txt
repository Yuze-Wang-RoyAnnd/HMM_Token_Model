brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down. we expect a lot more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. william haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted except for the homoerotic tie between billy and jack pickford, the town nerd. the movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... it's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century.
