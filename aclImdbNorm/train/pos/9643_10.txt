this movie has everything. emotion, power, affection, stephane rideau's adorable naked beach dance... it exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship. just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesn't mean there isn't quite useful insight for anybody in it. i would probably classify it as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people. mathieu's incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesn't encourage us to act any differently, and that is what engenders the discord between him and cedric. this is definitely a must-see!!!!
