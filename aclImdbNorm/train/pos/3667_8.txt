hollywood north is a satirical look at the time in canadian film history when the canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in canada. most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to get american films made. for example, porky's came out of it. anyways matthew modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved canadian novel. however, in order to get the money he needs a american name star. he gets a loose cannon and learns he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book it was originally based on. it plays well in canada but may not be understood outside of the great white north. americans will think we're satirizing ourselves but will miss the point that we're actually satirizing them. for canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
