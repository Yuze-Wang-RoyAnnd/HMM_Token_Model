i enjoyed this film, perhaps because i had not seen any reviews, etc. it was delightful and a little bit of a 'romp'. i don't know why it didn't make more of a splash than it did. as far as the story goes, i could relate to some aspects of the paul reiser character, and i could "see my dad" in falk's character. made me remember a lot of past times when i was a kid and listening to my grandparents, too. if you enjoyed movies like grumpy old men or on golden pond, this is your movie. a "sleeper", in my opinion, and one of those feel-good stories. peter falk and paul reiser had many wonderful verbal tussles, yet nothing was overdone. i would say it rates at least an 8, perhaps higher.
