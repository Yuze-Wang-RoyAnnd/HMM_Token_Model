in the hands of lesser actors than claudette colbert and robert ryan this film could have become silly and trite. but, with these two experienced thespians leading the way, i found "silent fury" to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery. when their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that colbert is already married, and that he was best man at that wedding, one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work. as colbert, ryan, and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage, they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed. although it's not very difficult to figure out just who the main "baddie" is, it's still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases. all in all, a good, solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated paul kelly.
