dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography, extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. this is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in german, and highly simplified german at that. perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible european audience, as anyone with even a little high school level deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. the story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star hedy lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of dreyer, vertov, and riefenstahl. if the film has any message to convey, i think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. this blend of soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. and, oh yeah, hedy does get her kit off.
