the 60's is a great movie(i saw it completely in one night) about the hippy movement in the late 60's. although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60's are not really important in this film.<br /><br />the main character of the movie is michael,a political activist who goes on the road in the us against the vietnam-war. there he meets his girlfriend,sarah.michael's brother,brian,goes to vietnam to fight(what a surprise!).he comes back from the war and changes in a "tom cruise born on the fourth of july" look a like and then into a hippy.his dad is a pro-vietnam war type of guy(what a surprise!!).michael's sister kate gets pregnant from a rock & roll artist and runs away from home and goes to san francisco during the summer of love. the ending is very poor(father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy),but i let this slip away from my vote(the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /><br />the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant. all the main events of the sixties are in the movie,like the murders on jfk and martin luther king aswell as the big hippy protests,the summer of love and woodstock! look closely for wavy"woodstock speaker"gravy(what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400.000!) as a first aid employee at the woodstock festival!<br /><br />in the end,the 60's is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
