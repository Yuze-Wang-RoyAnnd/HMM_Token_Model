this is definitely one of the best movies i've ever seen-- it has everything-- a genuinely touching screenplay, fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch, an actually elegant romance (it's a shame that that kind of romance just doesn't seem to exist anymore), lovely songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score, and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them. the ending was only a disappointment in that i was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end-- but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there. definitely check this movie out-- over and over again. there are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look.
