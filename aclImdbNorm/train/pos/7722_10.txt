this is a film that has it all, the dashing hero, the beautiful damsel in distress, the noble figure with the tragic flaw, and a truly wonderful robot. forbidden planet has maintained that special magic over the years and doesn't lose its flavor with repeated viewings (although the sex appeal of the youthful anne francis helps considerably on that score).<br /><br />movie fans will recognize the youngish leslie nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic commander adams, although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken aback by his appearance in a serious role. the distinguished and noble-looking walter pidgeon is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret (id). other supporting cast deserve a nod, especially warren stevens as the brainy and resourceful "doc", and of course the charms of miss francis, as noted above.<br /><br />this film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music, in the 1950s, no less. the credits call them "tonalities", but those of us who tried to tinker together early versions of the "theremin" device will recognize the eerie and spooky whines and screeches sometimes used in the sound track. still, it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and forbidding world of the krell.<br /><br />the special effects are also quite arresting. i recall my fear as a youngster waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible "id" monster, and when it is finally visualized in the one battle scene it literally shook me to my toes in wonder and awe. the magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various labyrinths and passageways, guided by the enigmatic dr. morbius.<br /><br />i recall feeling some measure of jealously that dr. morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of robby the robot. the persona of robby is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters. viewers of follow-on shows like twilight zone and lost in space will recognize the recycled robby prop in some of those episodes, although i recall he never had the "personality" of the original robby.<br /><br />i must admit to not fully understanding the complexities of the plot until i was old enough to understand the various references to freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves, through force of will, to submerge and control through adherence to societal codes. although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately overlooked) by dr. morbius until pointed out by the clear-thinking commander adams, who forces dr. morbius to confront the evil within himself. it still gives me goose bumps when commander adams pushes dr. morbius down before the krell machine that endowed him with superior intellect, which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the krell machine: "here. here is where your mind was artificially enlarged. consciously it still lacked the power to operate the great machine. but your subconscious had been made strong enough." zowee!<br /><br />forbidden planet remains probably my favorite sci-fi film ever, and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen.
