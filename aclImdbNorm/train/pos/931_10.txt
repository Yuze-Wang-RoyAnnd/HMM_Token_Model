i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite. george c.scott gives a depth to the scrooge character that the others do not give. the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter. the changes in scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him. <br /><br />this movie has the best tiny tim by far. he is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films. anthony walters still has all or most of his baby teeth. <br /><br />david warner is wonderful as bob cratchit. he is such a versatile actor. he portrays a man who clearly loves his family. he plays the role with dignity neither as a wimpy man cowering under scrooges'thumb but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide for. susannah york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life. edward woodward is the best ghost of christmas present i've ever seen. most often he is played as a jolly santa type character. in this he shows anger at scrooges attitudes and really makes scrooge reconsider. <br /><br />the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life. a wonderful movie.
