lost isn't the greatest tv show in history, but it's not far off. it doesn't have the plot or characterisation of the west wing or possibly even early er, however, it is arguably the most continuously gripping show i have every come across. i love the way i can't guess what's going to happen. i love the re-telling of the characters' back stories which often give rise to new dimensions for us to see them in. in some ways i want the show to last forever, but i think they can get 6-7 seasons out of it before they have to end it on a glorious high. the combination of the characters and their nationalities coupled with the show's fluidity for moving backwards and forwards thus extending dead characters "life spans" all adds to the overwhelming sense that this show is something very different from what we are used to. it's captivating, surprising and (here's a little suggestion for all of you conspiracy theorists) more than a little interactive- keep those internet discussions going- you're only adding to the plot...
