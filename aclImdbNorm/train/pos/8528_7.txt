i like peter sellers, most of the time. i had never seen him portray an upper-class brit until this movie. he pulls it off pretty well, although you see bits of inspector clouseau in the mix. it doesn't get interesting until goldie hawn arrives.<br /><br />i never expected the youthful hawn to deliver such a solid performance. her timing was great and her expressions were priceless. the way she alternately shoots sellers lecherous character down and seduces him is beautiful to watch. verbal sparring like i've seldom seen from a movie of that era.<br /><br />the last thirty minutes of the movie does fall flat. it is worth the let down just to see the first sixty. hawn is nude for a few glorious seconds early on. enjoy it...
