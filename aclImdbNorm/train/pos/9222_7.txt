there have been far too few mainstream films set in post-colonial africa, and the ones that have are a mixed bunch. this one, with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and worst values of africa, which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole. it also has shortcomings, given the undue influence of western pre-conceptions of africans and, especially, arabs.<br /><br />dr anansa linderby, the beautiful african-american wife of the english doctor david linderby, is captured by arab slave-traders, along with a teenage sanufu girl and a young boy. the lead slave-trader, suleiman, is every bit the stage arab, with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric, and gestures to match - which would not be out of place on "carry on follow that camel" but are not up the standard this film deserves. peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script, and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one-dimensional character.<br /><br />continuing the stereotypical theme, all three of suleiman's arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy, which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />one of david's first ports of call is the local police officer, a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african bureaucrat. david then meets two stereotypical white ex-pats, an englishman (walker, played by rex harrison) and an american (sandell, played by william holden). sandell is a mercenary with "conventional" views on mixed-race relationships, who initially refuses to help unless david provides payment up front. won over by david's love for anansa, and conscious of his own inability to find love, he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for anansa. they find suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory - as a result of sandell's hesitation and david's lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter is shot down but david survives.<br /><br />we then see david introduced to malik (kabir bedi), an african who has lost his family to suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance. they find the sanufu girl with a group of tuareg and know they are on the right track to find suleiman.<br /><br />in one of the most heart-rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not suleiman's group, and have no choice but to send their captives to the tuaregs they met earlier.<br /><br />later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and, in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones, he uses his knowledge to kill one of suleiman's henchmen. anansa on her part - and despite the scepticism of the boy - manages to engineer the demise of suleiman's two other employees.<br /><br />by this time suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market.<br /><br />suleiman, now in no doubt that anansa is "trouble", attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy arab prince (omar sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. on discovering that anansa is an american working for the u.n., the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences. the scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film.<br /><br />at the slave market, the young boy is sold to a middle-aged german paedophile, and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered "wunderbar" when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch-doctoring skills.<br /><br />david and malik finally confront suleiman and there is a bitter-sweet ending from malik's point of view.<br /><br />ultimately, david and anansa are re-united, and malik, whose life is in ruins, can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed.<br /><br />the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters. credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting.
