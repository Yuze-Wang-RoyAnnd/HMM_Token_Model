father and son communicate very little. in fact they speak different languages. but when the son drives his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage's to mecca, the conversations finally take place. they are difficult and growth is necessary on both parts.<br /><br />this movie takes us into the hearts of these two travelers, and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principals. the imagery throughout is impressive, especially the final scenes in mecca. it underlines for me once again how much different the world can be, but also at the same time, how similar. the same was true for the father and son in this film.<br /><br />see this movie. tell your friends to see it. you'll be glad you did.
