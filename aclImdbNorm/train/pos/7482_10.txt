"vanilla sky" was a wonderfully thought out movie. or rather, "abre los ojos" was well thought out. i watched that movie late one night, excited about what was to come. i wasn't disappointed. by the end of the movie, i was awstruck. i couldn't get it off my mind. the whole idea of it just blew me away. the ending, was more of a surprise than shyamalan could ever do. the plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through. the cast, superb. it was an all around wonderful movie. the kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. i've seen it four or five times and i'm always finding something new. it's a movie to keep you interested forever.
