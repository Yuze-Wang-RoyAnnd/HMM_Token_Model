and that's why historic/biographic movies are so important to all of us, moreover when they are so well done, like this one!<br /><br />before i saw "the young victoria", i knew a few things about queen victoria, but in the end i got much more knowledge about it. <br /><br />emily blunt is simply great as victoria (who would guess that!) and she probably will get a nomination at this years oscar's. personally, i'm cheering for her...<br /><br />for technical issues, i am pleased to say that is a very successful production, with wonderful art direction/set decoration and, of course, like it was expected to be, a terrific periodic costume design! <br /><br />the one drawback is that i want to see more and know more about this interesting queen, but foremost, incredible woman and mother! <br /><br />bravo: 9 out of 10!
