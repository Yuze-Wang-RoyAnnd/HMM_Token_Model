tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid. i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got. my favorite one was "the red sea sharks" - so much action and humor.<br /><br />this documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin. the film-maker's personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very moving.<br /><br />a great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist. a great example of someone who has become internationally renown, and has brought joy of millions of children (and the young at heart) all over the world.
