i thought that this film was very enjoyable. i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child. therefore, i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i still thoroughly enjoyed it. it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering, there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring. if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so, then they were obviously going to be disappointed. this is simply an animated movie; nothing more. if you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed. in closing, this is definitely not the best movie disney has made, but it is entertaining and i do not understand the bad reputation it has received.
