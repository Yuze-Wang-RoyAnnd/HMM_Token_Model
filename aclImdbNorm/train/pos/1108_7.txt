some of the acknowledged altman "masterpieces" seem sadder to me now. maybe it's me. like the last reviewer, i even like this "lesser" altman (shown recently on fmc), although i don't think he was aiming at a wide audience. organization politics as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. some of this satirical "docudrama" is now dated, like dick cavett watching the tonight show, but i found much of the dialog funny and insightful (e.g. "you are for real. that means you're no threat to anyone"). the story isn't "profound," but i liked it. and the performances are funny, especially cavett (as "himself"), lauren bacall as an aging conservative figurehead, glenda jackson (who actually became a member of parliament) as a left wing ideologue (in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics), and carol burnett as a basket case. all in the inimitable altman style, although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual. but pretty inimitable.
