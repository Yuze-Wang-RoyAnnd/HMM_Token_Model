i may be getting ahead of myself here, but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, i watched it piece-by-piece on tcm last night, the question arises to me: why did they do that? putting their lives in jeopardy, many of them died on the trek, why would they undertake such a life-endangering journey, just to find food for their animals (!) once they reached the "land of milk and honey", why didn't they just stay there? would you endanger your life, and that of your entire community, just to find food for a herd of cattle? as dangerous as it was, to do it for that purpose alone, shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people. risk death for a cow?? better them than i!
