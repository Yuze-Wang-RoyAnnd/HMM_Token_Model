life begins is a wonderful pre-code film starring some of the best of the era. it is set in the maternity ward of a hospital, particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble. in it is an older woman, a tough unwed mother (glenda farrell), a frail young woman, an italian woman, and the main character (loretta young) who is spending 20 years in prison for murder. her husband (eric linden) is at the hospital at every second aching to know that everything will be okay. aline macmahone plays the nurse who is great at her job.<br /><br />this film is highly interesting and entertaining. it isn't terribly shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen. the acting is brilliant all around. loretta young is gorgeous here in her prime. eric linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be. his innocence is reminiscent of michael j. fox. glenda farrell is great as always, a staple of pre-codes and for good reason.
