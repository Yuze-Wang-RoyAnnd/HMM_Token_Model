if you love kung-fu films and you haven't seen this movie, you are cheating yourself. this movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film. normally, it takes a die-hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films, but this one has it all! the story is well told, and complete. the fight scenes are great, and tend to end before you're completely bored with them (unlike crouching tiger). throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie. see this one at all costs. heck, my wife even enjoyed it.<br /><br />wu du it!<br /><br />9 out of 10<br /><br />
