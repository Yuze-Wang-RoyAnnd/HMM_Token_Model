thelma ritter did steal the picture. i just finished watching it again. i couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene. she didn't get the oscar. that's why you shouldn't put too much faith in oscars. richard widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3-d, flawed human being. jean peters was great as the streetwise, tough girl in her best role ever. and richard kiley must have been very good; why else would i have hated him so. yes, it was heavy handed on the patriotism; but, without it, you don't have much of a film. watch their faces! the top three stars didn't really need much script. i would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue. if you've ever seen ray milland and rita gam in "the thief", maybe you know what i mean. when i was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to nyc, i made my bronx uncle drive us to the foot of south street looking for no. 66. that's when i knew that hollywood couldn't be trusted. but i did find the river.<br /><br />i'm not giving away much of the story because i hate it when i know what happens before i see it for myself. if you have seen it, no elucidation is necessary. just maybe, someone who is reading these comments hasn't seen "pickup on south street". you will like it; just don't go looking for 66 south street in new york city.
