spoilers contained in order to make a observation.<br /><br />twenty years on from 1984, this film speaks loads about prince's future in the music industry.<br /><br />there is a scene that sums up prince's musical output of the last 10 years perfectly, which is if you took the best two songs off his last 10 albums you would have one fantastic album!<br /><br />the scene plays like this. prince runs off to his dressing room after playing one song and the owner of the club enters the dressing room to give prince an earful about his fall from grace during the 90's and putting out albums that only the most hardcore fans would be able to tolerate and support his artistry.<br /><br />club owner- "you're not packing them like you used to. the only person that digs your music is yourself!"<br /><br />spooky huh! how about the musical underscore which makes prince even more evil when he smacks apollonia to the ground in two separate scenes! it gave me chills that that was not the only scene women where mistreated in this film.<br /><br />i'm all for the comedy sparring's between morris day and jerome benton as these two stole every scene they were in. but what was funny about throwing a woman into a trash can? that was plain nasty! the other nasty bit was the chalk outline of prince's father on the floor thoughtfully provided by the minnieapolis police, which causes prince to go even more loony!! fantastic!!<br /><br />purple rain is an entertaining film overall, as it is the soundtrack of prince songs that boosts it's value by 110%. but then again the film gives us another theory on prince and his music, as the film tells us that prince's biggest song of the film is written by wendy, lisa and princes wife beating musical father!<br /><br />are prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets of written songs? maybe that is why prince started to run out of steam during the 90's because he ran out of his fathers ideas???...........hmmmm.....
