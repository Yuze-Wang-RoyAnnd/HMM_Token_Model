i didn't mind all the walking. people really did walk places back then. it loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the martians. i too was disappointed by the effects, in particular the "thunderchild" scene, which i regard as one of the most exciting in the book. but i can't praise this film enough, for its faithfulness to wells's story! it's about time. the actors are likable and the performances are charming. also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear jamie hall's truly great musical score. it was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in london.
