the world is a terrible place. but this movie is farce and it's fun. and if you don't like it... you don't get it... and if you don't get... it doesn't matter. it's up to you if you want to play along. every actor in this one had fun. it's only a joke. and that's good enough for me. gabriel byrne is priceless. byrne and paul anka doing my way is, as "vic" puts it, "...the best version ever". okay... it's no masterpiece, but it's not bad. i was warned against seeing it, but i'm sure glad i did...
