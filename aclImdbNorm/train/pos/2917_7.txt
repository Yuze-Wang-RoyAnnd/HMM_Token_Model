while this movie isn't a classic by any stretch, it is very entertaining as i remember it. i saw it about 15 years ago on hbo and loved the movie. it was written by the same guy that wrote and directed "arthur" and though it isn't as funny as that movie, it does show the potential that steve gordon reached with "arthur".
