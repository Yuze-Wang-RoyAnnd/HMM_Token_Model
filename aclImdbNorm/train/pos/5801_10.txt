this movie is exciting,daring and the music is very good.the movie moonwalker was meant to coincide with the album bad(1987).i have bad.it is excellent(*****).the movie begins with michael jackson performing"man in the mirror"on stage.then,it shows a history of michael,from his early days in the jackson 5 right up to the bad era. oh,and badder is good too(badder is a music video parody of the music video for bad the single).it then shows the speed demon video.the song and the video are very,very good indeed.same for leave me alone,which appears after.then it shows the movie moonwalker.after a few minutes,he plays smooth criminal in a club called club 30s.like it when he does the lean.anyway,nice to see you.bye bye.
