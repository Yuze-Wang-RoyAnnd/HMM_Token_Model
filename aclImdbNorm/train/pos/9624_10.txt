the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between.<br /><br />rob stewart is a wonderful actor i don't know why people keep giving him a bad rap. as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob it's only by five years.<br /><br />rob had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel. i'm sure you remember topical heat aka sweating bullets and painkiller jane.<br /><br />he also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini series.<br /><br />they need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at.
