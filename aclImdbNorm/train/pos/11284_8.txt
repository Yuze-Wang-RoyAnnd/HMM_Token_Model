when i was a kid it was lex barker's time as tarzan. i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller "was" tarzan and i wouldn't understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller's last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape. it wasn't after many years that i came across "tarzan and his mate", and then i understood. weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker, gordon scott, jock mahoney, denny miller, miles o'keefe and cristopher lambert.<br /><br />as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o'sullivan a strong, self minded, active and "no-inhibitions" woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made (tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused; one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it); such behaviors were unthinkable with the "janes" to come such as brenda joyce, vanessa brown, virginia huston or dorothy hart, all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle.<br /><br />o'sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily; the combination is perfect. another highlight in the movie is cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day.<br /><br />"tarzan and his mate" stands as a fine product in its genre (tarzan films) and perhaps as the best, though i have to admit that i also enjoyed "tarzan's greatest adventure" (1959) made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast (and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect "all gymnasium" physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man).<br /><br />good for jane and her mate!
