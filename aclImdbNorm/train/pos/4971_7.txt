this is an absurdist dark comedy from belgium. shot perfectly in crisp black and white, beno^it poelvoorde (man bites dog) is on fine form as roger, the angry, obsessive father of a family in a small, sullen belgian mining town. roger is a photographer who, along with his young daughter luise, visits road accidents to take photos. he is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record - and he decides that his son, michel, must attempt to break the record of perpetually walking through a door - he even hires an overweight coach to train him. michel dresses as elvis and has a spot on a radio show called 'cinema lies', where he describes mistakes in films. luise is friendly with near neighbour felix, a pigeon fancier. roger is a callous figure as he pushes michel right over the limit during the record attempt, which almost results in his death. interspersed throughout the film are magritte-like surreal images. it's undeniably charming and well worth your time.
