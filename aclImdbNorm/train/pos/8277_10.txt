a haunting piece that the discerning horror film fan will fall upon with gratitude. keep your freddys and your jasons -- this film is in the same company as "the haunting" (the original). lyrical and truthful, it stays with you long into the night, much like those terrifying cbs radio mystery theatre shows. a smart rent.
