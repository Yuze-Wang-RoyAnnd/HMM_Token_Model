this is a feel good film, about one person's dreams and the drive or push to realize them. it is a beautiful and inspirational film. why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out, especially the good ones. dennis quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of jim morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot at a professional baseball career. with excellent supporting cast, including brian cox, as the crusty old ex navy officer who has let so much of his son's achievements go by without his support. it was good to see him as something other than a villain in a film. if i have one complaint with this film it is this: don't ever let royce applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /><br />seriously, this film belongs to that handful of great baseball films like "field of dreams" and "the natural." it rates two thumbs up and a big "well done."
