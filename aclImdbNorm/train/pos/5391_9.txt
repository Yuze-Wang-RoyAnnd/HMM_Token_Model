life begins - and ends - in a typical 1930's maternity / recovery ward, where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women, played by loretta young, glenda farrell, clara blandick (aunty em???), vivienne osborne, dorothy tree, and gloria shea, as they await to give birth. while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and great-grandmothers. i found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving.<br /><br />oddly enough, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member, young eric linden as jed sutton, grace's (loretta young) husband. what an actor! as a first time father, jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table. i felt his every concern keenly. i'd like to see more of this actor's work. he had a very emotional voice, which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind. in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who screamed "don't cut! don't cut!" as scarlett fled the hospital in horror. chilling! another great performance is from aline macmahon, who plays miss bowers, the nurse. her character is a salt of the earth type, the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays, who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession.<br /><br />loretta young did another superb acting job here as well, a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace. my, she is great in these precodes, i've really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months.<br /><br />glenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste (didn't anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies' health?) but her character redeems herself in the end.<br /><br />also in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland, silent movie star, as a grieving italian husband. his screen time was brief, but notable.<br /><br />life begins is a must-see precode, try to catch it sometime on tcm, but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into. 9 out of 10.
