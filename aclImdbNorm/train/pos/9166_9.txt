if a more masterful adaptation than this one even existed, you need not look for it; you will find all and more in this near-perfect presentation of charlotte bront"e's masterpiece.<br /><br />rarely have i seen a film that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based, but i admit to that here. although i have not read jane eyre, i am convinced that i have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion. i only wish to explore the novel due to the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has stirred within me.<br /><br />i need not divulge anything in the way of plot here. let me just say this: if you are perhaps unsure as to whether you should watch or read the beautiful story that is jane eyre, i implore you to doubt no more! every atom of might and magic that has reared jane eyre as a popular classic of english literature has successfully been captured in this film.<br /><br />what bront"e did not bring herself, clarke and dalton managed to translate in the limelight with stupendous intensity. the movie's success is, no doubt, due in no small part to their acting prowess.<br /><br />love jane eyre or hate her, but appreciate the richness, the vitality, the truth of the story; love the characters; love the actors; all just as you would love what is great in cinema.
