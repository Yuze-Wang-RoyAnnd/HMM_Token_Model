my friends and i were just discussing how frustrated we are with the way movies and especially romantic comedy's are being made. we feel offended by the schlock that hollywood is serving up these days as they act like all is well.<br /><br />well all is not well...with the exception of a few bright spots, like this movie. it doesn't have the big name actors, the big budget, i don't think it had a big release (i rented from hollywood video) it didn't really have anything that most big budget romantic comedy's have.<br /><br />but it did have what most of those lack. it had great chemistry between the love interests, "parker" (jonathan schaech) and "sam" (alison eastwood). their love story wasn't forced on us like so many. the director took his time to allow these characters to truly get to know each other. their story reminded me of one of my favorites, "tootsie".<br /><br />the supporting cast added not only really funny comic moments, but depth to the story as well. james legros' character was absolutely priceless. sam's gay friend was hysterical. parker's interaction with his fellow employees in a psychic hotline was a lot of fun.<br /><br />i laughed, i cried, i remembered how great it feels to fall in love.
