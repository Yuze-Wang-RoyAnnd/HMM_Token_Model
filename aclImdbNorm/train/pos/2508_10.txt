this movie is amazing. the plot was just...wow.<br /><br />i was very surprised by gackt's and hyde's performance, after growing up in the american world of the actors who can't sing and singers who can't act.<br /><br />in this movie, a young sho (gackt) comes across a vampire, kei (hyde). over time, they form an unlikely friendship. kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others, the half-life of a vampire.<br /><br />it's a sad movie, but not sappy. the plot was very unique, and contrary to your typical vampire flick. the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing.<br /><br />the only fault i would say the movie had, despite it's lack of a happy--albeit peaceful
