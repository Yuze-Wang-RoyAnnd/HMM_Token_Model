i remember this series so well. it was excellent - such strong and compelling characters, stylish and sexy ... and so different to everything else on offer at the time - and now ... i am sure that it inspired the also excellent canadian drama "traders". <br /><br />both season 1 and season 2 are available on dvd region 2 in the uk. its a treat to watch the series again.<br /><br />season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes.<br /><br />unfortunately, it seems to have ended after 2 seasons.<br /><br />this series was a lot of fun.<br /><br />sometimes you can get it on special at amazon.co.uk
