the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot, as we have seen so many "super-people" movies these years... and in fact, i really liked it, as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn't expect. uma thurman performed as average in g-girl's role. surprisingly, i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen (like in the beginning of kill bill). luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman, i could really get into his situation. if you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch g-girl's and average matt's adventures, especially to cheer up your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
