"gandhi as a husband and father?" has always been discussed by people in india. 'gandhi...my father' is a story that only a few would have known to such details. surely an insight into gandhi's personal life.<br /><br />overall, i liked the movie for story and cinematography. jariwala, akshay khanna, and shefali shah have all done a good job. most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop wallpapers...commendable job. traditional indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happenings.<br /><br />however, what i didn't quite like was the narration style. at several points, i found the tone over-dramatized.<br /><br />overall, good work by anil kapoor productions. i would recommend it as "must-watch-once". 8/10
