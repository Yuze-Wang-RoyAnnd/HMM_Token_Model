i wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this movie, since the only problems i have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems. that doesn't make it bad, just not something i'd go far.<br /><br />it is a little saccharine, so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for-kids movie like this.<br /><br />however, all of that goes out the window when that squirrel (the one in all the trailers) comes on-screen. his time is limited, but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys 'hey, could you stick in a little more squirrel?' every time it's getting intolerably dull. that doesn't save the movie, but you can leave saying 'at least there was one aspect where i couldn't stop laughing.'<br /><br />and of course, visually it won't disappoint, but that's almost a given with pixar flicks. of all of their stuff, i'd put this at the bottom...but that isn't in itself bad.
