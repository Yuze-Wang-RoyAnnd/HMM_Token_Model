for years we've been watching every horror film that comes out, from the dull hollywood retreads like saw 2, to awful indie releases that are completely unmatchable... we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like "dark remains".<br /><br />we managed to catch a screening of this film at shriekfest 2005. the audience loved it and i believe it ended up winning the award for the best film.<br /><br />while it may not have the budget or star power of studio films, it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category. the acting and cinematography are top notch, but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view. the story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares.<br /><br />the editing and visual fx are also top notch. and while many horror films don't manage to use music to their benefit, the score for "dark remains" only adds to it's creepiness.<br /><br />i know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals, but none have been near me, so i can't wait to hear when it'll finally be coming out on dvd. trust me, even if you're sick of the current state of horror films, give this one a try... you won't regret it!
