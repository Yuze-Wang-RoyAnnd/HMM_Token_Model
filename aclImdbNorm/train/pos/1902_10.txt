let's begin with that theme song sung by christopher cross. the song is "if you get caught between the moon and new york city." it's a great theme and song even after all these years, it never gets tiring. it really is a great song about new york city as well. anyway, the great dudley moore cbe stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to jill eikenberry's character in the film. jill would later star on la law. anyway, he is served by his wonderful british butler, sir john gielgud om who won an academy award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor. arthur falls in love with liza minnelli's character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her oscar winning role in cabaret. no, liza doesn't get to sing. she plays a diner waitress. anyway i love geraldine fitzgerald as the bach matriarch of the family who decides the family's fortune. anyway, she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for best supporting actress. barney martin best known as jerry's dad on seinfeld plays liza's dad. he's great too. the movie was well-written, acted, and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it.
