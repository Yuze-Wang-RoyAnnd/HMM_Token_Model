this show was absolutely great, and i always look forward to watching it.all the characters were funny and awesome in their own way, each and every episode provided non-stop laughter, and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows.everybody was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny, that you couldn't help but love this show.there were a few dead weight episodes, but that '70s show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere, to where it just really didn't matter.this was one of the best shows to ever be aired, and i will watch this show anytime i can, for it never gets old, never gets unfunny, and never gets uninteresting.
