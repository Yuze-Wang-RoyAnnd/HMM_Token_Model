elia kazan, one of the best theater directors this country ever had, showed he was equally at home with movies. with "panic in the streets", mr. kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, with perhaps his master piece, "on the waterfront", although both movies share only the water setting, for they are different visions about different subjects.<br /><br />mr. kazan shot on location in new orleans. the adaptation by daniel fuchs of the edna and edward anhalt stories that are the basis of the film, is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting "the big easy". one of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by joseph macdonald that shows new orleans at its best. also the music by alfred newman and the song by billie holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch.<br /><br />this film, could have been shot in new york, or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like "broklynese" than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country.<br /><br />one thing comes clear in the movie, jack palance, making his screen debut, smolders the screen every time one sees him. he was so intense! at the same time, this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, who unknown to him, is stricken with a fatal disease. blackie, comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man's greasy hair with abandon. notable also, was the fact that mr. palance and mr. mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts, something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real.<br /><br />the film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the reed family at the beginning of the film. we see a family man painting furniture with his young son. later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary, something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis. richard widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people. barbara bel geddes, as the wife, sounds as though she's a suburban woman from connecticut.<br /><br />the film is enjoyable thanks to mr. kazan's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie.
