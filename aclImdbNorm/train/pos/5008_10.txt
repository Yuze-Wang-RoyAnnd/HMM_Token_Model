barbra streisand's debut television special is still a pinnacle moment in entertainment history - in any media. cleverly divided into three separate acts (to minimize the interruption of commercial breaks), streisand made the bold-yet-masterful decision to drop the typical variety show format of the time (which is why there is no guest stars nor forced banter) and carry the entire show on her shoulders alone. the risky move paid off enormously, as my name is barbra set a new standard for musical programming on television.<br /><br />filmed in glorious black-and-white (which actually adds to the effectiveness of the show), my name is barbra is flawlessly-conceived and impressively shot. however, what makes the show truly transcendent is streisand herself. watching the then-23 year old performer navigate herself through the show's 55 minute runtime is nothing less than thrilling. she is in fantastic voice (and even performs the entire first and third acts live), and gives first evidence of the immense star power that would soon follow her to the big screen.<br /><br />the special's biggest asset is it's boldness in allowing streisand to simply stand on stage and sing some great songs. after the powerful opening performance of "much more" (with a brief opening snippet from leonard bernstein's "my name is barbara"), barbra proceeds to wander through a multi-level studio set performing a frantic version of the disney classic "i'm late." in between verses of "i'm late," streisand stops at various levels of the set to sing some terrific numbers such as the haunting "make believe" and the thundering "how does the wine taste?" halfway through the act i, barbra re-enters her own childhood to the strains of "a kid again," and then gives highly energetic performances of "i'm five" and "sweet zoo" while romping among an over-sized set. the illusion is eventually shattered, however, as streisand finds herself out of the fantasy and back in the real world. she then sings about this lost childhood innocence in the lovely "where is the wonder?" streisand then dashes out onto a platform stage surrounded by an entire room-full of musicians and performs a rousing rendition of "people" before the thunderous applause of a live studio audience.<br /><br />act ii of the special begins with streisand hamming it up for the studio audience with a campy rendition of "i've got the blues," before delivering a comedy monologue about "pearl from istanbul." streisand then heads off to bergdorf goodman's department store, which allows her to sing a medley of poverty songs while parading around in some of the store's elegant fashions. this segment is the brightest highlight of the special for many fans and critics. some high points of the act ii medley include streisand singing a restrained version of "second hand rose" to the audience, appearing as a latin bullfighter to the tune of "nobody knows you when you're down and out," and portraying a frustrated paperboy while mugging to "brother, can you spare a dime." the third act of the special is a straight concert, with no set pieces or concepts. streisand is a performer who really thrives on the concert stage, and this segment is the most thrilling moment of the special. streisand enters belting out an almost gravity-defying rendition of "when the sun comes out," and continues to amaze the viewer with a lovely version of the yearling ballad "why did i choose you," a scorching performance of "lover come back to me," and an impassioned medley of three songs form funny girl. streisand really outdoes herself, however, with a phenomenal rendition of the fanny brice/billie holiday standard "my man," which instantly became on of the singer's best-loved signature songs.<br /><br />streisand performs her immortal ballad version of "happy days are here again" as the closing credits roll by on the left-hand side of the screen. the iconic finish to the number reaffirms to the viewer that he or she has indeed seen something truly special. my name is barbra was a huge rating triumph when first aired, and it eventually picked up five emmy awards in addition to spawning two top-five, gold-selling soundtrack albums. watching it all again, it's absolutely no surprise.
