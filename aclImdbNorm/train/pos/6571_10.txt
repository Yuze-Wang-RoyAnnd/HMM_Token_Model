<br /><br />the first thing i have to say is that i own jake speed. i've seen it at least 10 times. this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made. the film begins with margaret (karen kopins) trying to find her sister. her sister was kidnapped in paris and the family has heard nothing. along comes jake speed (wayne crawford), telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her. jake speed is a hero. he doesn't work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. his partner (dennis christopher) follows him around and writes their adventures into novels. this film is a great adventure. it's hilarious, it's action-packed, it's just great. i guess it's a cult film with a very small cult following. crawford is perfect as jake speed and throws out some one-liners that you'll never forget. kopins and christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick, respectively. john hurt, the guy who's stomach blew up in alien, plays the devilish, pervertish villian which just adds to the fun. in many ways, this film is similar to indiana jones, in some ways it's similar to james bond films. maybe it should have been called indiana bond but whatever it's title is, it's a very enjoyable film.
