this film is really cool. every thing looks like it came out of the comic book. the sets, the costumes, and the plot is great. clark bartram is again our favorite batman. he looked a bit better in dead end, but he still pulls it off. superman is great too. the flying effects are ok. but its a fan-film so we cant expect them to be the greatest. the shot with superman catching the car was very believable. it was cool. this is a movie i would definitely see if it were real. its got every thing you would want in a batman/ superman movie. one exception though, i would cast the joker instead of 2-face..... overall i give this film a 10 because its a great film.
