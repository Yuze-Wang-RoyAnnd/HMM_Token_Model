this animation tv series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works. yes, this is biology but they will never tell it is.<br /><br />i truly think this is the best part of this stream of "educational cartoons". i do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton, and of course: organs.<br /><br /> in the same stream, you'll find: "il 'etait une fois l'homme" which relate the human history from the big bang to the 20th century. there is: "il 'etait une fois l'espace" as well (about the space and its exploration) but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future.
