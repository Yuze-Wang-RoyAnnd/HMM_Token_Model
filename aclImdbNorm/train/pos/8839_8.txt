thank god this wasn't based on a true story, because what a story it is. populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, before the devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it weren't carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />the main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke) deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry.<br /><br />the story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: "charlie: two days before the robbery", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn't like this device but i thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life. throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to gina (marisa tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from albert finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and you've got a shakespearean/greek tragedy on your hands. proceed with caution.
