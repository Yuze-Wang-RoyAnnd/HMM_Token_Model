this is a great ending to the show. the fact that adm. janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great. the fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the queen with a "poison" that in, essence, ended the borg was great. the way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie. however, they did bring them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic!! it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family. ending it with tom and b'lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning. it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type - just to see where their characters would be today.
