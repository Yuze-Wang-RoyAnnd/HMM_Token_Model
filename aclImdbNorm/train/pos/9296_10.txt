i love this movie. it's wacky, funny, violent, surreal, played out in a madman's head, and definitely not your usual comedy. <br /><br />if you don't find the film amusing then i guess it's just not for your tastes, so this is a tough one to write a review for.<br /><br />for reference, some other comedies i love are the big lebowski, the princess bride, and zoolander (that one only got me the second time around). there are others, but my taste is definitely for the unusual, and i am willing to accept that most people just don't tend to like that kind of thing. i make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour - at least i have one.<br /><br />the scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together, the verbal humour is hilarious, the situations are intriguing, the acting is very good (as you would expect of the cast), though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high. the overall package makes for fun, funny, watchable yet violent entertainment.
