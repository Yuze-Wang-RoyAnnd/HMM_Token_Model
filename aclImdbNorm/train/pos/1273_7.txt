a simple movie in the beginning, a simple movie in the end. it does have that un-ending and pretending cliche, but, most tv movies have that any ways.<br /><br />christopher reeve does a good job as being an ex-con/drifter. the marriage between her and the woman he works for, i feel is a bit queer, but, i believe for the time period it is set in, that it is believable none-the-less.<br /><br />now, i saw the edited 'tv' version, even tho the movie was made and showed on 'tv', i find that a bit queer as well. but, i feel if i saw the entirety of the piece, i would give it more-in-likely the same rating.<br /><br />j.t. walsh does a nice job, not his best role, but, still....a nice job.<br /><br />7/10
