this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced. -- a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash, has radio contact with a young american woman who comforts the brave pilot, knowing that within minutes he will be dead. for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven. when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and demands to have his "day in court" to argue his case. the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life, that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person, one who deserved a chance to live on. <br /><br />the "heavenly court" is a cinematic delight! the "announcement of the jury of peers" is a definite highlight. the story, as fantastic as it seems, is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time. the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a "kleenex treatment" for most viewers. this film is in my personal all-time favorite top 10, it has my highest recommendation!
