in the opening scene, the eye patch wearing desperado named hawkeye has a smooth forehead, but when he follows johnny into the pueblo, he's shown with a scar over his patched eye. that's just one of the many continuity lapses in this edgy 'spaghetti' western, but rather than detract from the picture, it adds a special flavor to the proceedings.<br /><br />another occurs when sanchez turns in his three dead bodies, they have to be examined for their identities - "you just can't imagine how many false cadavers we have in our town". immediately after, carradine (lawrence dobkin) shows up to collect his bounty with no more than a wanted poster in hand.<br /><br />as for the film's principal johnny yuma (mark damon), he's shown with his holster alternately on his right and left hip throughout the movie after exchanging gun belts with carradine following the barroom brawl. johnny's bound for san margo at his uncle's request, but will have to avenge his death at the hands of deceitful wife samantha (rosalba neri) and her conniving brother pedro (louis vanner). it takes some time getting there, but it's a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record. as for that saloon fight, i got a kick out of the kung fu sound effects every time a punch connected.<br /><br />care for some more story exaggerations? following the duel with pedro the first time, johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to smear pedro's entire face with. similarly, when pedro smacks around little pepe later in the film he doesn't cut him, but by the time johnny arrives, pepe's face is covered with blood.<br /><br />"johnny yuma" is probably one of the best of the genre that doesn't have clint eastwood in it. as johnny, mark damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior. carradine seemed to be a replacement for the obligatory lee van cleef character, without being a total bad guy. at first the identity exchange between carradine and johnny didn't seem to make sense, but it all tied together by the time the film ended. you knew each henchman would wind up getting his due; marking time for each was part of the anticipation.<br /><br />in case you're wondering, the title hero has nothing to do with the nick adams character from the classic tv western "the rebel". in this film, johnny got his name from a gunfight he had in yuma once.<br /><br />perhaps the most unique element of the story had to do with the way it tied things up with the evil samantha who pulled the strings behind the scenes throughout. after shooting carradine she beats a hasty retreat before johnny can get his revenge. still alive, it looks like carradine tries to shoot her and misses, but it doesn't take long for johnny and sanchez to track her into the dessert where she perished without water - carradine aimed for her canteen.
