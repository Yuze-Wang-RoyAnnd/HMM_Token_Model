having set the sitcom world alight with 'father ted' arthur matthews and graham linehan's next creation was a forgotten gem for the bbc called 'hippies' although created by the pair- the six scripts were written by arthur matthews alone.<br /><br />set in london in 1969- ray purbs, a hippy, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. his friends are his flat-mate, the very laid back and cannabis smoking alex, his 'girlfriend' is feminist jill and the none too bright hugo.<br /><br />simon pegg was superb as ray, but he is superb in everything he is in. this sitcom had a feel of 'citizen smith' about it. ray was very much like wolfie smith, trying to beat society, but failing miserably. at last this sitcom is going to be released on dvd in march, i can't wait to buy it. as it was on in 1999 and has yet been repeated on terrestrial television- my memories aren't too good of the sitcom, yet i remember two episodes really clearly, the first being the opener 'protesting hippies' which i thought was a great start- where ray goes on a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was 'hippy dippy hippies' which i think was episode 4, again quite a clear memory about the police. sadly, the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers (i can't think why). the bbc commissioned another series, but arthur matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction. oh well, i can't wait for the dvd.<br /><br />best episode: hippy dippy hippies- series 1 episode 4.
