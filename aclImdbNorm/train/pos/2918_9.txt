...i saw this on cable back in the late 1980's as i was a big wrestling fan since 1986. i saw this on vhs in a 'for sale' bin and bought it.<br /><br />in 1998, i started training as a wrestler after the air force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very accurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling ( families and friends that wouldn't understand us, the travel, the heartbreak, etc. ). henry winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is creatively. a great way to separate himself the fonz character he played on happy days at the time. plus, look at the cast...william daniels ( knight rider ), polly holiday ( alice ), and wrestlers roddy piper and chavo guerrero sr. if you get a chance, watch it.
