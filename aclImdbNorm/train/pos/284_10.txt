the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the days' and their lives. the family consisted of abby day (mum), jack day (dad), natalie day (sporty daughter), cooper day (outsider son), and nathan day (boy genius son). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, i'm really sad another season wasn't made. it was a great show i'm gonna miss it.
