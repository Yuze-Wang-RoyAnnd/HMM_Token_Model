it has been some years since i saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. it kind of became a "therapy" for me with a personal experience of my own.<br /><br />a thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he "missed the ball" and his team lost. he thinks about it 20 years later, "if only i'd hit that ball" and how his life would be better because of it. then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets a little more than he bargained for.<br /><br />it reminds me so much of when i was in high school, i twice tried out for our drill/dance team and didn't make it. this team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. if you were on it, you were "all that." i didn't try out till my last two years of hs and after the second time, i took it really hard. i'd hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise, and that caused me to not make it. that was in 1987.<br /><br />through the years, even now sometimes, i think "if only i hadn't hit my leg i would've never worn those stupid tights." now i don't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past. who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that i wouldn't have met my son's father.<br /><br />i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. be careful what you wish for!!!
