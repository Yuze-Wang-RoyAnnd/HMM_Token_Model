when you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically under-utilised asset the late dudley moore was. there should be a dozen movies like this in our archive.<br /><br />he was already top-notch talent before he went to hollywood, both as a comedian and a musician. but mostly he is remembered for his pairing with peter cook, on television and in one or two indifferent british movies. perhaps the best of these was 'bedazzled'. <br /><br />he always tended to be eclipsed by cook, who's jealousy and meanness rifted their partnership and enabled moore to realise his true potential in america. 'arthur' is the result. <br /><br />this is a truly splendid movie. moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. the script is perfectly suited to his manner with lot's of hilarious, almost surreal conversational digressions. there is something so british about him that i'm actually surprised he found such an appeal to american tastes. tommy cooper, an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank. it is moore's almost childish vulnerability that is so endearing.<br /><br />liza minelli and john guilgud tend to play straight roles against him, but still have some excellent one-liners. john guilgud in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and acerbic authority that is a treasure to watch. he invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his oscar. correct me if i'm wrong, but he has never played any other comic role.<br /><br />there is a follow-up movie called 'arthur 2 - on the rocks'. it never attains the same sublime levels of fun that this one reaches, but it is still rather good even so. guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost. it is darker. and there is some interesting soul-searching. it will disappoint if you watch 'arthur' first.<br /><br />hollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly dudley after these two outings. he eventually returned to britain, dejected and apparently dying.<br /><br />but 'arthur' is a sample of what might have been. we can only imagine the other great movies he should have made.<br /><br />your're sadly missed, dudley.
