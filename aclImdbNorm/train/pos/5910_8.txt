ok, ok, don't get bent out of round. i was kidding.<br /><br />"bustin' out" is actually a better and truer title anyhoo.<br /><br />racism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our x-rated animator friend ralphie boy. and he does one of his better jobs here.<br /><br />on the crime front it shows the truth. they build it, defend it, then boredom and stronger rivals cause them to (maybe) lose it. see for yourself to see what goes down.<br /><br />racist? i don't know. with scatman (rip) and the love walrus (also rip) being black and the main point of view, i saw it as an attack on racism mostly. the fact that richard pryor liked it says as much as well. and the younger (pre "miami vice") phil mike thomas in there was a nice surprise.<br /><br />it's an animated "blacksploitation" film. that's a good thing. done well and well done. it will make some squirm (like the lynching scene) but unfortunately that's based on fact.<br /><br />but ralphie really should have re-thought that title.
