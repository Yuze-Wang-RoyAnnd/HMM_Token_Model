after his classic film noir homage chinatown roman polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which, like repulsion and rosemary's baby, deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment living.<br /><br />claustrophobic environments are the ones which polanski is best at creating, and this has to be the most suffocating and confined picture he ever created. the emphasis on side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever, and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely glimpsed. but the tenant is not just confined spatially, but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist. trelkovsky, played by polanski himself is not only in every scene, he is in virtually every shot. when he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes trelkovsky's point of view. and of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirror.<br /><br />i can't think of any film that is more about the internalisation and solitude of one character. some psychological thrillers, like m or peeping tom, manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist. others, like psycho, attempt in-depth scientific analysis of his mental condition. the tenant fits into neither of these categories
