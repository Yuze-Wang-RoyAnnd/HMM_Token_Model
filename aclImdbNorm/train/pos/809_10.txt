a very good movie. a classic sci-fi film with humor, action and everything. this movie offers a greater number of aliens. we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces. the emperor is somewhat an original character. i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese. (excellent references) i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga. in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls. i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obi-wan. it gives a sadness and a tear. the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie: when vader turns on the emperor. luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obi-wan, yoda and...his father (1997 version not hayden christenssen). the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia. there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending. i felt there was much more than meets the eye. and as always the john william's music will bring the classicism into star wars universe.
