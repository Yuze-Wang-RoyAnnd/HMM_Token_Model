i've seen this movie, when i was traveling in brazil. i found it difficult to really understand brazilian culture and society, because it has so many regional and class differences. to see this movie in sao paulo itself was a revelation. it shows something of the everyday life of many brazilians. on the other side, it is sometimes a little bit over-dramatized. and that's the only negative comment i have on this film. it's sometimes too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for one film. the director could film some things a bit more subtle, it would make the film more effective.<br /><br />despite this i liked the movie and the way the story unravels itself. the characters are complex, and very much like real-life people. not pretty american actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics, but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time. that makes the film realistic, even when the story is not that convincing.
