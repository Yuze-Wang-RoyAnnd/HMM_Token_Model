my super ex-girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less. <br /><br />the story is quiet simple. matt saunders(luke wilson) meets jenny(uma thurman) on the subway and hooks up with her. in the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be ok, but then matt finds out that she's g-girl. at first that seems really cool to matt but it turns out that g-girl is very jealous and needy. so he decides to break up with her and hook up with his colleague hannah(anna faris). this makes g-girl very mad and she starts to avenge herself on her former boyfriend.<br /><br />what i liked most in the movie are the scenes where g-girl avenges herself on matt. it was also nice to see anna faris in another role then her character from the scary movie saga.<br /><br />i give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anybody who likes a nice comedy.
