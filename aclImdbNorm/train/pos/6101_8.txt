so i don't ruin it for you, i'll be very brief. there's some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast. a young graduate of harvard med school (brian white) finds out he doesn't know as much as he thinks about people. he goes to a small hospital in florida for his internship because a girlfriend (mya) left him for a job as a tv producer. his senior resident (wood harris), helped marvelously by his 'creative collaborator'(zoe saldana) bring him up to speed. they help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money (as seems to be true for many of my pre-med friends).
