i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about 10. it was on right after bay city rollers. i saw it come on to family channel one day, and taped it for my then three-year old daughter. i'd forgotten all the things i'd loved as a child, the magic flute, the zoom broom, witcheepoo's makeup.<br /><br />this show is decidedly low tech. the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese, and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes. but kids love this stuff. they would way, way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation. there is (mild) slapstick, but no adult themes such as sex or people dying, and kids accept jimmy's schemes. kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire, and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead. the music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really loved it. she used to sing "different is hard, different is lonely" in the car. my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and it's still one of her favourites.<br /><br />i see that a new pufnstuf 2000 is in the works. i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don't do anything like computer-animating characters etc. i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf.
