i don't know why some guys from us, georgia or even from bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don't understand at all. for those who did not watch this movie - watch it. don't expect too much or don't put some frameworks just because this is kosturica. watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor inside - people of serbia did actually getting married while bil clinton bomb their villages, gypsies in all balkans are always try to f*ck you up in any way they can, love is always unexpected, pure and colorful, and balkans are extremely creative. for those who claims this is a bad movie i can see only that the american's sh*t (like meet dave, get smart etc) are much much worse than a pure, frank balkan humoristic love story movie as promise me. the comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer. i think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside. it is simple, but true. it is brutal, but gentle and makes you laugh to dead.
