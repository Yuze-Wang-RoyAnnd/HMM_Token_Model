first off, this movie was a wild ride the whole way. the story of the training of the soldiers, fighting with their superiors, and in the end grouping together.<br /><br />from the very beginning to the very end. this is one war drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing (at times beyond reason) and the horrors of what boot camp are.<br /><br />the dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite amazing at times, and sometimes humorous. how bozz (colin farrel) deals with paxton (matthew davis) throughout the storyline, from camp to tigerland, and even in the end helping him.<br /><br />the innovative free-hand filming did add a certain taste or flavor to the film. constant moving, constant action, and just constant confusion. at times, it was a help. others, not so much.<br /><br />throughout the film, it was increasingly realistic. some points in the film (the sex scenes in particular) seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that wouldn't have been there without them. it was a very gritty movie, through and through.<br /><br />in my opinion, this is one of colin farrel's better movies (if not his top performance). the acting for every character was superb. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
