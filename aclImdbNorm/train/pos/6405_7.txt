i thought the racism and prejudice against carl brashear was grossly overdramatized for hollywood effect. i do not believe the u. s. navy was ever that overtly racist. i cannot imagine a full captain, the commanding officer, ever telling his chief to intentionally flunk anyone. certainly not at the risk of his life. and there has never been a chief petty officer as unabashedly prejudice against everybody but wasps as deniro's character. no chief as slovenly and drunken as he was played would have ever risen to master chief in the first place. cuba gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie.
