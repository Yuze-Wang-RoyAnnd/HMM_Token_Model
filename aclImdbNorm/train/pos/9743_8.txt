we first watched this film as part of a festival of new argentine films in 2000 at the walter reade. although we liked it, we didn't think it was extraordinary. watching it for a second time, we found a different meaning in this look at life in buenos aires.<br /><br />the film takes place in one of the darkest days of argentina, as the delarua administration was ending. the country was in turmoil after the economy, which had flourished earlier in the 1990s, under the artificially climate president menen created. it was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmare.<br /><br />the story begins just as santamarina, a bank employee, is fired because the collapse of the economy. instead of receiving sympathy from his wife, she locks him out of the apartment and he, for all practical purposes, becomes a homeless man. he takes to the streets trying to make ends meet.<br /><br />the other story introduces us to ariel, a young jew, interviewing for a job in a spanish company. it's almost a miracle he gets the job. his father, simon, owns a small restaurant in the jewish quarter of "el once" in the center of the city. things go from bad to worse, when ariel's mother dies suddenly. only estela, the young woman who is in love with ariel, comes to help father and son.<br /><br />santamarina, who is a clean man, has to resort to take showers wherever he can. he chooses a ladies' room in one of the subway stations. when the attendant, elsa, finds him naked, she becomes furious, but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times. they become romantically involved, and santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage, finds an infant. elsa, while surprised, wants to do the right thing. but santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their love.<br /><br />ariel, who has met the gorgeous laura at work, begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker, who unknown to him, is involved in a lesbian affair. ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions, feels a passion for laura, but he realizes what estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him.<br /><br />daniel burman, whose "el abrazo partido" we thought was excellent, did wonders with this film. things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around. if anything, this second time, the nuances of the screen play mr. burman and emiliano torres wrote, make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days.<br /><br />daniel hendler, who plays ariel, has collaborated with mr. burman before to surprising results. he is not 'movie star pretty', yet, he is handsome. this actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work. enrique pineyro is another magnificent surprise. his santamarina is disarming. in spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him, he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets. stefania sandrelli, the interesting italian actress, makes a great contribution to the film with her elsa. hector alterio, one of the best argentine actors plays the small part of simon. the gorgeous chiara coselli is seen as laura and melina petrielli appears as the noble estela.<br /><br />"esperando al mesias" proves daniel burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the argentine cinema.
