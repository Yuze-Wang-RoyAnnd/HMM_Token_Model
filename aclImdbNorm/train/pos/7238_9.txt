small spoilers alert !!!<br /><br />good movie...very good movie. and i'm surprised to say that myself, because i'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name deran serafian usually means bad news. most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen. this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action. this movie really fascinated me. good accomplishment, seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved. it really is the story that keeps you focused. especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied. sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth. it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle. of course, that's where the reality and the "based on a true story" stops. the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker.<br /><br />in this movie, the count ( vlad teppish) emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman. and they're all pretty girls, i'll give him that. overall, good acting by unknown faces, enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline. this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore. but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr. heck, it's a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title. these two films have nothing else in common, but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture. check it out...my humble opinion on to die for = 8.5/10
