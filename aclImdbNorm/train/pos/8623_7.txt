der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film - but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it's reasons and ramifications. those looking for a gore-fest, or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik films or schramm will probably be disappointed. der todesking is definitely an "art-house" style film, so those that need linear, explainable narratives need not apply...<br /><br />the basic concept of der todesking is that there is an "episode" for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide, interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse...<br /><br />there are some very well done and thought provoking scenes, including the man talking about the "problems" with his wife, and the concert massacre (which unfortunately lost some of it's "power" on me, because i was too busy laughing at the scorpions look-alike band on stage...). but seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful (the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene, and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge...), sometimes confusing, sometimes silly (the she wolf of the ss rip-off is pretty amusing), sometimes harrowing (i found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective) film that is more of an "experience" then just entertainment, as many of these "art" films are meant to be. still, i didn't find der todesking to be as strong as nekromantik or schramm, and would probably put it on relatively even footing with nekromantik 2 in terms of my personally "enjoyment level". definitely worth a look to any buttgereit or "art" film fan. if you dig this type of film - check out subconscious cruelty - in my opinion the best art-house/horror film that i've seen. 7/10 for der todesking
