the autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart-rending books i have ever read. it tells the amazing stories of two sisters, both who earned devotion and respect working well into their 70's as a teacher and a dentist, then lived another 30 years with dignity. ruby dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious "blacker" bessie, the dentist. she not only expresses her anger, angst, and wisdom well; she lets you know exactly where they've come from using an economy of words. diahnn carroll has the feel of the older sister, the teacher, down perfectly, but i'm afraid she never makes me believe that she's over 100. no matter -- the stories are well worth telling. amy madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the caucasian ny times reporter. this, too, is only a minor distraction. the stories, all true, are the attraction and although two or three get slightly damaged in the translation, most of them make it through just fine.<br /><br />i recommend the book as essential reading to all people i recommend any books to. i cannot quite but this tv-movie in that rarefied air, but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right.
