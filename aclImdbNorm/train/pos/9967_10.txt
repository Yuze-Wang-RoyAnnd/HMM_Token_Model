there are some things i will never understand; why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly thats not enough is an example. similarly, i will never understand this film, and that is brilliant. if you approach this film expecting an actual movie, you might as well be approaching satan expecting a hug; although that may well be possible if you greet this film's satanic figures. take pitch for instance; the most ineffectual, camp, unhellish portrayal of a devil since freddy mercury and wayne sleep joined forces to create a ten foot satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms. however, it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever. seriously, this is no understatement. the same can be applied to every other character, bar the little girl who acts so sickly innocent she's probably overcompensating for some serious crime she's part of. then again, if santa's inter-space recon station is real, there is no chance she could have avoided him this long. put simply, if you haven't seen this movie, you cannot consider yourself a serious buff. the achingly funny characterisation, acting, concept, and almost-under-the-radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date (if you're after pure laughter that is).
