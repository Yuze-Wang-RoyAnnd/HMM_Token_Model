whoever said that horror wasn't an educational film genre, huh? thanks to this marvelous hammer short movie, i now at least know never to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house, because he might just be hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts & mind forever! thank you hammer! the tenth episode in the house of horror series is another one i've been looking forward to seeing, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was don sharp; one of britain's finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated. sharp was responsible for some very cool hammer films, like "kiss of the vampire" and "rasputin: the mad monk", as well as some overlooked independent productions like "dark places" and "psychomania". his contribution to house of horror is easily one of the best in the series, with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes. the plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror, but it's actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon choronzhon; the demonic guardian of the abyss. the mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies, but michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device. when he picks up a clearly petrified girl who's running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed, michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy. satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical british horror topics, but david fischer's screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits, among which a highly inventive climax. there's also plenty of tension to admire, the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid (especially john carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie). recommended!
