atlantis: the lost empire has some of the best, smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any disney movie i've seen. and i was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. i especially love don novello's voice work on vincenzo santorini and phil morris as joshua strongbear sweet. too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate - at least in the first act. one important aspect of any disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which atlantis doesn't provide. he's average at best. halfway through the movie there's a mediocre twist. that's all. it's a great movie nevertheless. everyone should check it out.
