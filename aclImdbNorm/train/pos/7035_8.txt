cusack does his best david niven in this one, although i don't know if anyone besides me noticed it.<br /><br />when seen with this in mind, its a deliciously over saturated 'wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty d*mn funny' reworking of an under-appreciated comedy classic.<br /><br />hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond. the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot - interesting choice.<br /><br />i never knew how soothing montel's voice was until this movie... i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs!
