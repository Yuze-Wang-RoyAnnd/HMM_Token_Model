this story is beautifully acted. it is both sad and heartwarming about a young girl's journey to discover where she has come from and where she is going. stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car crash, and ever since she has been labeled the 'miracle baby', she is dyslexic and is finding life a bit tough. her findings along the way affect those closest around her. her relationship with her guardian and her guardian's ex boyfriend are handled very delicately and sensitively, and the whole of the supporting cast are genuine, 3 dimensional and believable. set around a peach canning factory in small town australia, this is a warm gentle, erotic film, and leaves you with a pleasant feeling when the credits close. after reading some of the other rather shallow comments about hugo weaving, i would like to add that i think he was brilliantly cast, and was extremely sexy. no, he is not brad pitt, but that doesn't mean that he isn't attractive.
