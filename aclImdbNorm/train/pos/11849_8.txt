if only all animation was this great. this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects: story and character. the characters in this film are beautifully personified. i felt for all of the characters, and human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. the beautiful animation and 3-d computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film. this is a great movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 of 10.
