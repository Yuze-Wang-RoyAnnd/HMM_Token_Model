blackadder 3 is probably the blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. but it is still great - a fiery duke of wellington and a fat foolish dr johnson (writer of the first dictionary in england) make this series one to be reckoned with. there are still more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but rowan atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one, and hugh laurie is at his best in this series. very good! 9/10
