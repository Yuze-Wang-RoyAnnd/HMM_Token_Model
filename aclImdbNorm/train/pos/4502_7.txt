i have seen virtually all of cynthia rothrock's films, and to me this is the funniest. it reminds me of early jackie chan movies. admittedly, ms rothrock may not be the greatest actress, but she is very good to watch as both a martial artist and as a very cute young lady. this film, while probably not the best of all her films, was the most entertaining.
