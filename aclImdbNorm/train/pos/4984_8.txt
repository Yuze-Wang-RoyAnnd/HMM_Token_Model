"secret of the lens" is perhaps a pretty campy all-time favorite of mine. the best and funniest from kajawari yoshiaki, who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime. i wish he did more campiness like this.<br /><br />my favorite scenes are the psychedelic cg sequence, the parts where lord helumis blows up his failing henchmen, the party riots that bill causes (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever my favorite character, worsle appears.<br /><br />check this out.<br /><br />warning:this is not for serious sophisticated anime fans!
