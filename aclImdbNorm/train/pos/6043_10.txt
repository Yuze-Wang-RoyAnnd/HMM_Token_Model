i have seen the freebird movie and think its great! its laid back fun, about time the british film industry came through with something entertaining!! its good how the guy who met them at the service station gets mentioned way into the film in the news agents, nice touch. the acting was convincing (i am a biker) they reminded me of some good times i have had in the bike scene. it was good to see the film director getting in on the acting, well done jon ! at the end a new crop gets mentioned, in ireland is this the foundation for a 2nd film? hope so keep them coming. great film , well written, realistic characters !
