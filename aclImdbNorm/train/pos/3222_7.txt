the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts: the -thematic- conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity, and the -physical- conflict between todd and his bio-engineered replacement. both sequences are quite gripping in different ways.<br /><br />peoples' screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half-way through the movie, which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp.<br /><br />nonetheless, kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very little.<br /><br />not a great film, but one worth seeing.
