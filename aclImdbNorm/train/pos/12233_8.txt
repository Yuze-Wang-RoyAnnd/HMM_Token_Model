astronaut steve west (alex rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of saturn. his comrades are killed instantly, but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones. steve returns to earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp; as he turns into a savage killer, melting every step of the way, he is tracked by his friend, dr. ted nelson (burr debenning).<br /><br />this is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional. it seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the '50's and 60's, and as such, it's a marvelously entertaining movie. that sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. we're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything, but is still a gas to watch.<br /><br />writer / director william sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed. i think his pacing is a little off; some scenes (like the one with the elderly couple) go on a little long, but ultimately he delivers solid, schlocky, b-movie goods with a degree of panache. the climax is especially fun.<br /><br />arlon obers' music is enjoyably shuddery (yet also amusingly silly during some moments), and willy curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots at times. that brings me to rick bakers' fantastic and convincing makeup effects, which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie, right down to the ultimate final melt.<br /><br />rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie (sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running) and does what he has to do well enough. debenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero, and ann sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife, but myron healey, michael alldredge, and lisle wilson are fine in support. it's also worth it to see folk like cheryl "rainbeaux" smith (doing an appreciable topless shot), janus blythe (of tobe hoopers' "eaten alive" and wes cravens' "the hills have eyes"), and even director jonathan demme in a bit part.<br /><br />this is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore, chills, and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere.<br /><br />8/10
