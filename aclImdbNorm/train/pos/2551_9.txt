this almost unknown gem was based on a french farce--which shows, and i mean that as a compliment. <br /><br />caroline (lee) is being courted by a wealthy argentinian (roland), who asks her father for her hand in marriage. but caroline is already married to anthony (colman), who has just arrived by plane and launches immediately into an audience-directed reminiscence about the last time caroline decided she was in love with someone else: a dilettante-ish sculptor (gardiner). the film plays out the story of anthony's strategy in uncoupling caroline from her sculptor, and how that experience aids him with her argentinian.<br /><br />it is perfectly cast: ronald colman is at his most sophisticated and charming, reginald gardiner is at his most priggish, gilbert roland is at his most exotic, and anna lee is just deliciously whimsical. the film is wonderfully directed by lewis milestone (who also produced); the whole production feels like a labor of love. there are wonderful touches, such as colman breaking frame and addressing the camera, and exceptional use of a sliding bar-cabinet door. it is a sin that it hasn't been released on dvd--this is the kind of film that can singlehandedly awaken interest in classic film.
