i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, who was made into a monster by society. suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got. but it was a happy surprise. my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male lead isn't bad to look at surely helped), and there was enough plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other's name had the whole movietheatre laughing) to keep you entertained and invested in the story. so in short: not what i expected, but a very good surprise indeed. i'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd.
