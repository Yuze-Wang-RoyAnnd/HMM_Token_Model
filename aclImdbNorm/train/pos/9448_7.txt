this was, undoubtedly, the most disturbing movie that i have ever seen. the first part of the movie, though strange, has a light and amusing quality to it. the journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of appalachia. but that is misleading beyond belief. the obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the countryside's inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie. i can still hear bobby moaning in pain, and i shudder at the thought. lewis's leg made me wince. yet, while the movie was, on the whole, very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. when is it moral, or right to take another individual's life? what can morality drive us to do, or not do, in some cases? and are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? whatever conclusions one may draw from the film, it is an achievement in its own right (despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome).
