bsg is one of my all time favourite tv series. i was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it's final season. it was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was! <br /><br />as soon as i noticed the pilot on hulu i knew exactly what i was in for just by the title - caprica! although, some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed. there were no mention about the holobands in battlestar galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe i haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain why.<br /><br />i recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology, and alternate fantasies of our world. this show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more!
