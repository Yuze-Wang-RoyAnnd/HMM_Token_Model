this episode of twilight zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic acting and sight gags, an homage to the early buster keaton films. lots of slapstick: buster falling on a bulkhead door, falling in a puddle, running around pants-less. silly scientist's invention of a time helmet, reminiscent of a flash gordon idea of what the future would be. cheap prices, like $1.95 for ladies hats, or 17 cents a pound for beef seem outrageously high to buster. even the world of 1890 is too much for buster/mulligan. how shocking when he is mistakenly transported to the "modern" world of 1960! buster was trying to go backwards! the "scientist" of that time wants to return to a calmer world, the 1890 that he has studied and admired. they go back together, and buster/mulligan is now happy and the "scientist" regrets not having electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. so buster sends him back with the crazy helmet.<br /><br />this twilight zone doesn't have a heavy message. since buster keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last efforts. that's enough.<br /><br />one other cute thing--longtime underutilized maytag man jesse white is a repairman who fixes the time helmet--foreshadowing his washing machine career.
