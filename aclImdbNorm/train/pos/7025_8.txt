i found this to be a charming adaptation, very lively and full of fun. with the exception of a couple of major errors, the cast is wonderful. i have to echo some of the earlier comments -- chynna phillips is horribly miscast as a teenager. at 27, she's just too old (and, yes, it does show), and lacks the singing "chops" for broadway-style music. vanessa williams is a decent-enough singer and, for a non-dancer, she's adequate. however, she is not latina, and her character definitely is. she's also very strident throughout, which gets tiresome.<br /><br />the girls of sweet apple's conrad birdie fan club really sparkle -- with special kudos to brigitta dau and chiara zanni. i also enjoyed tyne daly's performance, though i'm not generally a fan of her work. finally, the dancing shriners are a riot, especially the dorky three in the bar.<br /><br />the movie is suitable for the whole family, and i highly recommend it.
