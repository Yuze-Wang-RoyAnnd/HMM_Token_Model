i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. i am glad i did. it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game. i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a movie/game remake. the bonus levels were very hard! the sniper one i think was too hard, it made me so frustrated i didn't play the game for a week and a half. there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. <br /><br />the only thing i might change was the upgrade system. i didn't notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade didn't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter. i really liked the q copter. i think the developers did a good job.
