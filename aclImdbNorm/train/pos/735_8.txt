marvelous cult film from 1979 in which the students of vince lombardi high school are confronted with a new, dictatorial principal named miss togar (mary woronov). togar is a music hater and blames the musical tastes of the students for their transgressions. leading the charge against her is fun-loving riff randell (p.j. soles), the #1 ramones fan who, more than anything, wants the rock group to record her songs.<br /><br />now *this* is an impossible movie to resist. first and foremost, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by such artists as alice cooper and the velvet underground in addition to the infectious non-stop assortment of ramones songs. "teenage lobotomy", "sheena is a punk rocker", and "blitzkrieg bop" are just a few of them. next, the cast truly gives it their all, with soles an ideal choice for the role of riff; she is a true delight. vincent van patten and dey young are earnest as tom and kate, woronov is well cast against type as the snooty and disdainful togar, clint howard has one of his best ever parts as washroom-occupying entrepreneur eaglebauer, and new world regulars such as dick miller, paul bartel (particularly fun as music teacher mr. mcgree) and the real don steele are fun as always. and, of course, it's a treat to see the ramones playing themselves.<br /><br />the movie has true spirit. the energy level is high, with co-story author and director allan arkush bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings. there's also a great sense of humor. the paper airplane gag is a superb example of this. this extends right to the "wipe" style of scene transitions. there are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects notable rob bottin, in one of his earliest gigs.<br /><br />about as good as an authority-defying, defend-one's-right-to-party film can get. "rock 'n' roll high school" is, quite simply, a wonderful cult film.<br /><br />8/10
