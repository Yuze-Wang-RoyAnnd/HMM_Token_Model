we showed this movie at the local film society, and the art-house crowd had the time of their cinematic lives. it's tasteless, groovy and very funny in a sixties kind of way. the kraft kitchen recipe sketch had them laughing like maniacs. the rest is a mixed bag, but the highs definitely beat the lows. by the way, whatever happened to ken shapiro??
