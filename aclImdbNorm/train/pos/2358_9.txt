pushing daisies is just a lovely fairy tale, with shades of "amelie"'s aesthetic and romance. it's got a beautiful palette, its shots well thought out and detailed, its names and dialogue whimsical and too cutesy to be real, its imagination great, and its romance deep.<br /><br />watch the blue in the sky pop out at you, as blue can't be found in the rest of the sets or shots (with few exceptions).<br /><br />watch a weirdly natural and totally satisfying song break out of a scene.<br /><br />its score is gorgeous, its cast is supremely likable, there's great music, and the two leading romantic stars can't touch each other or she'll die. how much more sexual tension do you need? (actually, i had wished they found a way around this one, but c'est la vie).<br /><br />it is simply a show that it is a pleasure to spend an hour with, and i recommend it highly. there hasn't been other television quite like it, and i would like to see more. it got me through a flu one crappy week, as it makes for good company.<br /><br />bring it back!
