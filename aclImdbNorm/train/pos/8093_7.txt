my friend had the idea of watching the animated lotr after seeing the peter jackson return of the king. so i finally bought it off e-bay, thinking right from the start it was going to suck. actually, it really wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. the animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who did the voice for frodo sounded somewhat like elijah wood.<br /><br />not the greatest adaptation of a book, but trust me, i've seen a lot worse. it skips quite a lot of things, since both fellowship and the two towers are compressed into one two hour movie. definatley worth a watch, kids might like, but still, absoutley no comparision with the peter jackson trilogy.
