jim carrey can do anything. i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie, and it totally was not. it was so incredibly funny for everyone, adults & kids. i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres, and now it's finally coming out on dvd this tuesday and i'm way to excited, as you can see. you should definitely see it if you haven't already, it was so great!<br /><br />liz
