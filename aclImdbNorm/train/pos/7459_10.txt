i am a huge fan of say anything, jerry maguire, and almost famous (i wasn't that big on singles), so it's safe to say that i look forward to anything that cameron crowe attaches his name to. i went to see vanilla sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that i probably wouldn't like it if i was expecting anything similar to crowe's other films. well, having just seen it, let me say that the former was correct, and the latter couldn't have been more wrong. it is a very weird movie, and nothing really comes together until the end. anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory. anyway, the movie was stellar, and i look forward to owning it as soon as the dvd is released. i was moved by the film, and felt emotionally spent by the end. this is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion, if the viewer allows him/herself into the plot. in the theatre in which i saw the movie, there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot. i'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this. i don't mean that to sound pompous, but some people are more cut out for the seagal, chan, van damme genre of movies, and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie. it is very cerebral, so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender, as well as much thought afterwards.<br /><br />as far as comparing this film to other crowe movies, it is very similar in at least one regard, in all crowe movies, the soundtrack is a character unto itself. this is almost definitely due to crowe's longstanding ties to music, as anyone who has seen almost famous knows, and to his marriage to heart star nancy wilson. it was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between tom cruise's acting and crowe's directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen jerry maguire. in my mind, that is not a bad thing.<br /><br />anyway, if i had to compare this movie to any one other film, i would say this: if you enjoyed david fincher's the game, you will almost certainly be a fan of vanilla sky.
