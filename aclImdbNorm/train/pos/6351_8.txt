when the grinch came out i was excited though i thought it was going to be a happy go lucky film and it was. though it did have a little nightmare before christmas touch to it. you know kind of dark and spooky. i loved this film because it helped fill people with the christmas spirit. so mostly the grinch saved christmas. and what happened then well in whoville they say that the grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day. merry grinchmas!
