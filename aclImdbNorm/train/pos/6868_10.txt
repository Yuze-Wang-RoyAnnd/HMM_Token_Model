i saw this in detroit in what must have been its original run. i literally rolled into the aisle of the theater. it was that funny. i haven't seen it since, but would love to. where do you get a copy? anybody saying anything about it being dated or overdone are, for my money, just a bunch of poseurs. each skit is either wickedly, erotically or perversely hilarious. each one! there is not a weak one included. the opening sequence, for instance, which parodies 2001, features gorilla go-go-dancers with pendulous breasts. felinni would have filmed it had he the wicked wit... if you come to this film with an open mind and a blithely sneering heart, you'll pencil it right into your very best list.
