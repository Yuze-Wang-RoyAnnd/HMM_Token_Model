this film is pure elvira and shows her at her breast... i mean best! the story (co-written by cassandra peterson, elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by elvira's wit and charm. the viewer gets an opportunity to see elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of fallwell, massachusetts (where she has travelled from los angeles in order to attend the reading of her great aunt morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help the long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal chastity pariah and the rest of the town council. she also has to deal with her attraction to bob redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (patty) who has her eye on bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as elvira. and, later in the movie, she also faces the complications of being descended from ''a major metaphysical celebrity'' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake. elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meanings.<br /><br />this movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. in the end elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman.<br /><br />i've seen this movie countless times and i never ever get tired of it! there are no unnecessary scenes and i found myself captivated throughout the whole movie. a review will not do justice to the actual movie, so i can just tell you to please watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made! meanwhile, i wish you ''unpleasant dreams!''
