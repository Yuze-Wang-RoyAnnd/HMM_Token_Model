a well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending. pluses: the way the story moves - begins with soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he's there. the music. a disinterested look at the life of policemen. minuses: the violence and the gore, but i guess they add to the realistic effects. still, having people's heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided.<br /><br />no complaints - 7/10
