solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters. while being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not simply about hate or jealousy. what i liked most about the movie was how i could identify with the feelings gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. to see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave. and as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. i could even identify with giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many insecurities. a really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.
