this is one creepy movie. creepier than anything david lynch, and that shows what a great director polanski is since this is not his usual type of work, and it is brilliant.<br /><br />it all starts of with trelkovski moves into a tenement block in paris. he soon learns that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it. he also believes that they are trying to do the same to him. what results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia.<br /><br />the whole production has classical horror written all over it: from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor trelkovski's terror building up.<br /><br />are they all out to kill him? or maybe just drive him mad? is there a difference? find out for yourself. 10/10
