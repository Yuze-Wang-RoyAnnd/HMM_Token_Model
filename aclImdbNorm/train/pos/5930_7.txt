monstrous mother-son-duo (alice krige and brian krause) sucks life-force of virgins, and their newest target is pretty but lonely tanya (madchen amick). however, these monsters are allergic to cat's scratches... i have never been fan of sleazy, overrated bestsellerists like king, koontz or barker, but this b-movie, written by mr dung himself, is actually not near as bad than it could be. yes, it is sometimes jaw-droppingly atrocious, but there is actually some surprisingly impressive touches: good old-fashioned graveyard, eerie soundtrack and candlelit-gothic-house-scene, mirror showing the monstrous form of the villains, etc. of course, the film is polluted by mr dung's potty-mouthed dialogue and all-tactics-of-toilet-seat obsession to vilify fat people, leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher, but there is roses among manure.
