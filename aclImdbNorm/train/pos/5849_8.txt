damn straight.....this show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to outshine cartoons today. i can't wait to track down some of the dvd's to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. i've already introduced him to voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one)and i laughed my head off when he said to me one day "dad..you sure watched some awesome cartoons when you were a kid!!" how cool is that.<br /><br />come on hollywood, dust this one off and give it a live action attempt. couldn't be any worse than spiderman 3 was...man oh man... 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies.<br /><br />ok, i'll shuddup now<br /><br />cheers
