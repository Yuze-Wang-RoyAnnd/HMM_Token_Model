i recently rented the animated version of the lord of the rings on video after seeing the fantastic 2001 live action version of the film. the lord of the rings live action trilogy directed by peter jackson will undoubtably be far better than george lucas' star wars "prequel" trilogy (episodes 1-3) will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century!<br /><br />i remember seeing the animated version as a child, and i didn't quite understand the depth of the film at that time. now that i have read the books, i understand what the whole storyline is all about. to be sure, some of the characters are quite silly, (samwise gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as jar jar binks in star wars episode one, (awful!)) but, i have to say it follows the book rather closely, and it goes into part of book two, the two towers. the good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it's time. the bad things are that it ends upruptly halfway through the two towers without any result of frodo's quest to destroy the one ring, and the animation looks quite dated compared to today's standards. <br /><br />overall, not as bad as many say it is. but, the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of the lord of the rings! at least ralph bakshi took the script seriously! peter jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film, so we can at least thank ralph bakshi for that matter! i'll take the animated version of lord of the rings over the live version of harry potter anyday!<br /><br />a 7 out of a scale of 1-10, far less violent than the 2001 live action version, but nowhere near as good! for diehard fans of the books and film versions of the lord of the rings.
