"a girl's folly" is a sort of half-comedy, half-mockumentary look at the motion picture business of the mid-1910's. we get a glimpse of life at an early movie studio, where we experience assembly of a set, running through a scene, handling of adoring movie fanatics, even lunch at the commissary. we are also privy to little known cinematic facts - for example, did you know that "frequently, 'movie' actors do not know the plot of the picture in which they are working"?<br /><br />the plot of this film in essence is movie star kenneth driscoll's discovery and romancing of a budding young starlet whom he discovers while shooting on location in the country. i believe the 30-minute version i watched was abridged, included on the same tape with cecil b. de mille's "the cheat." it is a very credible film - an easy watch with a large cast of extras. as a bonus it includes some of best-illustrated captions i have ever seen accompanying a silent movie.
