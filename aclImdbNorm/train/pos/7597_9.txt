lost holds something interesting for everyone. you can say an awfully lot about this series, and an awfully lot has been said, so i won't be the one to spell it all out for you again. just read the persons who loved it, and you'll know why you want to watch it. the nice thing about this series is that its totally new. there are not much movies -and even fewer- series based on the theme of only suspense, but lost lives up to the theme with pride. its all about the unexplained and if you combine that with an exotic location, nice plot twists, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined in single episodes) you'll have a series in which every episode is a story on its own but part of a greater telling. you want to have all the insights of the characters, you want to see the overall picture and you'll want to know where the writers are taking you. the result of that is that its a series which does not let you go. on a more sceptic note, the series went under a bit in season 2, probably due to its own success. it is well known that lost was only written for one season originally and when the overwhelming success followed, the writers were overwhelmed too. in my opinion they made the mistake to add even more mysteries and in a higher pace in season 2, then to solve the ones (or partially at least) the ones of season 1. at the end of season 2 you ended with a big blurr of secrets, plot twists and unexplained phenomena, but there is only so much a viewer can take. the difference between season 2 and 3 however was huge. season 3 handed out a lot of insights, to partially replace them with new questions. and that's exactly how they should write; you want to thumble from one plot twist to the next, not get a tsunami of secrets spread all over you and then pick up a few to explain to the viewers. they got that in season 3 and brings us a promising series future for season 4. its good to see that such a different format of a series, can be so hugely popular.
