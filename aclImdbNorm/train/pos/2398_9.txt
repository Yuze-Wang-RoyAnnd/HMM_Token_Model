i really enjoyed this movie. it took a pretty dark story-that of shakespeare's macbeth- and wrapped it in a quirky, often funny and poignant modern yarn.<br /><br />kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern nyc and macbeth's scotland together under one roof. the opposing worlds act to<br /><br />really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love harold perrineau as the chorus, a part which doesn't exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up. the ending stands out among little indies i've seen for it's closure and originality.
