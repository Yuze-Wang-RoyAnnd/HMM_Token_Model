bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the williams family, living in the california desert. they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, they've been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present and future collide.<br /><br />this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that have at each other, a friendly and tiny little e.t. who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. this picture does show off a little imagination, if nothing else.<br /><br />very nice music by richard band, engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen, randall william cook, and peter kuran, and, importantly, a likable family are key assets. it generates a sense of child-like amazement; it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation.<br /><br />i found it hard to resist; it's a short and sweet (80 minutes) diversion, and a decent credit for director john "bud" cardos (of "kingdom of the spiders" fame) and executive producer charles band.<br /><br />7/10
