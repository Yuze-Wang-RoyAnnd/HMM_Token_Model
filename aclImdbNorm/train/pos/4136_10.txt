i have become quite fond of laurence olivier in the past few weeks, and was thrilled when i discovered this gem. i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.<br /><br />the divorce of lady x is charming till the final scene, and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938. i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny.<br /><br />the divorce of lady x is well worth anyone's time.
