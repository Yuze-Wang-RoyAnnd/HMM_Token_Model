i've watched a bunch of episodes of cold case since its premiered (especially now that it immediately follows the amazing race, but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting i've seen from the house of bruckheimer. the casting, especially of the younger officers, was spot on, and the script and editing, the soundtrack, and the acting made this episode a tour d'force. if i were the producers i would submit this episode for emmy consideration. it amazing how complete a portrait was made of coop and jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode; that takes a lot of talented people doing their best. i hope there's is advance warning of when this episode is repeated, because i'm sure i'll notice a lot that i did not notice the first time around.
