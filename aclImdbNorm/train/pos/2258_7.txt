i believe sarafina is a tremendous effort of whoopi goldberg. besides her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character, sarafina. since i work in a high school with urban children, i think this is an important film to show south african history of apartheid. sarafina is a movie about education and a teacher's relationship with her student, sarafina. i bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore. i watched it and fast forwarded through the musical numbers. but i strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand. now while i don't know the other actors and actresses in the film, i assume that they are very popular in south africa and i am glad that they filmed with a south african cast and crew with the exception of goldberg in a small role but if it gets people to see this movie, than whoopi reaches worldwide appeal.
