late, great grade z drive-in exploitation filmmaker par excellence al adamson really outdoes himself with this gloriously ghastly sci-fi soft-core musical comedy atrocity which plumbs deliciously dismal and dopey depths in sheer celluloid silliness and jaw-dropping stupidity. in the grim totalitarian future of 2047 sex has been deemed an illegal act by the big brother-like impotent bumbling idiot the controller (an amusingly goofy erwin fuller). however, sweet'n'sexy cinderella (radiant blonde cutie pie catherine erhardt) remains determined to change things for the better. with the help of her effeminate fairy godfather (a flamboyantly campy jay b. larson), cinderella attends a grand gala ball with the specific plan of seducing handsome stud tom prince (the dorky vaughn armstrong) and teaching everyone that making love is a positive, pleasurable and wholly acceptable activity.<br /><br />adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his customary all-thumbs incompetence, staging the incredibly awful'n'inept song and dance sequences with a totally sidesplitting lack of skill and flair. the uproariously abysmal "we all need love" number with people in absurd animal costumes awkwardly prancing about the forest is a hilariously horrendous marvel; ditto the equally abominable "mechnical man" routine featuring a bunch of clumsily cavorting robots. louis horvarth's crude, static cinematography, the tacky plastic miniatures, sparky sugerman's groovy throbbing disco score, the copious gratuitous nudity (ravishing brunette hottie sherri coyle warrants special praise in this particular department), the brain-numbingly puerile attempts at leering lowbrow humor (roscoe the robot law enforcer is especially irritating), and the uniformly terrible performances (renee harmon's outrageously hammy portrayal of cinderella's wicked overbearing stepmother cops the big booby prize here) further enhance the strikingly abundant cheesiness to be savored in this delectably dreadful doozy.
