some spoilers if you are a big horror movie fan, then you will know that halloween paved the way for many slasher films. often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made, if not the scariest.<br /><br />i actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). i honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one, that's just how it worked out. but i would have to say this one blows all the others away. it is genuinely frightening, and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine. my favorite part of the movie was when michael stabs a guy, and leans his head to one side. it is one of the eeriest images in movie history.<br /><br />later slashers, such as the friday the 13th films, were more fun and less intense than this movie. i do like the f13 series better than the halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the f13 movies. michael myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic, you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people. i admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights.<br /><br />what's great about this movie is that it doesn't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. it is just pure terror. it's too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one, because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come.
