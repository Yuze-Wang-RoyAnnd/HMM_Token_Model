i liked this show a lot - we got the first and only, it would appear, series in the uk on channel 4. the characterisation was right on the money - a bit like the simpsons in that all the different facets of small town populace were represented.<br /><br />there was no laughter track - i hadn't seen this on an american tv comedy at the time except for on larry sanders and it really worked well here, heightening the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that, and not just hamming it up for the cameras.<br /><br />all in all, a quirky little number that tickled me just right: i can't help but think that maybe it missed it's mark with certain audiences. i think it would have been a cult hit in the uk had it been shown at an acceptable hour.<br /><br />i'll round this off with my standard comment: where the hell can i get hold of this to watch it again? any ideas?
