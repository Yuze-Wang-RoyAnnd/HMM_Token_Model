don't listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting silverman infamously gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago, "the sarah silverman" is wonderfully bizarre, surreal, immature, ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line-up. if silverman tones down the juvenile "doody" jokes and emphasizes the darker, meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at, we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled "strangers with candy". but just from watching the pilot, its just solid, not outstanding, offbeat dark comedy/musical but with huge potential. <br /><br />silverman has created a hilarious child-woman of a character - a prettier, younger, jewish american princess version of the late great jerri blank and the show features one of the most unconventional, non-stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television. early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so i can't wait to see how this show unfolds.
