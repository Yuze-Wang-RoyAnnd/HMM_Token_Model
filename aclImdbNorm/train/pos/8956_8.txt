i watched this movie after watching practical magic, and the older film was far superior. i liked the way the lighting, makeup, and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story. jimmy stewart's mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film, but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillian's character. i was also struck by nicky's and gillian's mannerisms--it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine. the gestures nicky makes when he's showing redlich his powers especially struck me. i've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate, so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters.
