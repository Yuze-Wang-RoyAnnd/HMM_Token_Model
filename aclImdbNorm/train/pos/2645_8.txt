no movies have grabbed my attention like this one has. you see, i have wanted to watch this movie again for over twenty-five years. the one and only time i saw it was as a teen-ager which may have been the year it was released, 1977.<br /><br />what i do remember of the movie is that it touched those deep-held emotions so profoundly that there is still an overwhelming desire to watch it again. the intrigue this movie provides by the human element of father/son seeking and searching is sure to touch every human soul who watches it. why this movie has not been brought out of storage and shown as often as many other movies of lesser depth, i do not know.<br /><br />postscript: received copy of movie and after watching it again was delighted to see that my memory held true. rating reflects movie content. would like to watch this movie on dvd as seeing this 1977 production on a used vhs tape took away from the overall quality.
