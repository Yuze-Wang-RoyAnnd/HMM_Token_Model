this story was never among my favourites in christie's works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation. the mouse motif was effective if a little overdone, the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot. the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they weren't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting didn't allow for that! i thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming; perhaps its because i've not long re-read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on.<br /><br />humour was much more prevalent in these early poirots. sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode (though i did smile at the 'lemon sole' throwaway line). altogether though, a solid entry in the series though not one of the best.
