what's in a name? if the name is jerry bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action.<br /><br />in producer bruckheimer's latest film, gone in 60 seconds, its all about the nomenclature. with character monikers like kip, sway and the sphinx and cars idealized with names like diane, sue and the elusive eleanor, it's only the non-stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game.<br /><br />not a deep script by any means, but it is a great vehicle for action as nicolas cage as memphis raines, along with angelina jolie and robert duvall, comes out of car-thievery retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. a remake of the 1974 cult hit, this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining.<br /><br />surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting. although loaded with stars, none of them have standout performances, including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers, giovanni ribisi. even jolie, coming off her recent oscar win, is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time.<br /><br />can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film? i think so. the film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity, the action is non-stop and the suspense is compelling. just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre.<br /><br />3 1/2 out of 5
