something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. it was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of hollywood every month.<br /><br />i saw this movie on video because i did not even know about it before i saw it at my local video store. if you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. the suspense builds throughout and the twist ending is excellent.<br /><br />
