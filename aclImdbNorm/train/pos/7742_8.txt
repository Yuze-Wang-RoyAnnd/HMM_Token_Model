intense actors like bruce dern, jason patrick and rachel ward combine to make this modern-day film noir a winner. of the three, i don't know who was most interesting as all offer good performances and intriguing characters.<br /><br />patric does the narration in this noir, playing an ex-boxer and mental patient. wow, that alone makes for an interesting guy! he looks dumb, but he isn't. ward is the slinky, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co- conspirator of a kidnapping plan that goes bad. bruce dern also is in the mix and dern never fails to fascinate in about any film.<br /><br />the movie could be considered kind of downer to the average viewer, but i found it fascinating....and i don't like depressing movies normally. what i found was a kind of quirky crime film. take a look and see if you agree. this is pretty unknown film that shouldn't have that status because it's simply a good story and well-done.
