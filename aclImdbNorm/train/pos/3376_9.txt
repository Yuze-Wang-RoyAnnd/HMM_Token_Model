this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast, a gripping story with a chilling ending, great music, and excellent visuals without significant special effects. it is interesting to note though that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted. that's not to say we're out of the woods yet, but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition. it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: "1984", "2001: a space odyssey (compare its space station with our international space station) and isaac asimov's "i robot" (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's).
