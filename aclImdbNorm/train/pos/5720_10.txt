i saw "the grudge" yesterday, and wow... i was really scared, a good thing. i love horror-movies, and i really liked this one. there were so many 'surprise'-scenes (what's the english word?) that made you jump in your seat. though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. i think the most scary scene was... on the bus, when the face flashes by on the window, or when yoko's walking without her chin. the make-up is also very good. sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene. the boy was very good indeed, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on. the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared...
