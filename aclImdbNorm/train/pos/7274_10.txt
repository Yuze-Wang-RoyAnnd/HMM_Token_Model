no strings attached is one of carlos mencia's best performances to date. mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues. however, he does more than that in this stand-up performance, which took place in san francisco. in general, mencia's material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today.<br /><br />in this hour long performance, mencia talks about such things as illegal immigration, what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion of mel gibson's passion of the christ and an argument that he got into with a woman regarding whether or not he is affected by jesus, and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally handicapped. mencia even discusses whether or one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke.<br /><br />carlos mencia is not afraid to offend, which at many times gets him trouble with his critics. for example, he does go somewhat far (and he admits it) with a joke regarding pope john paul ii and what he is most likely doing in heaven right now. <br /><br />mencia's main message in all of his performances is that we all have have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend. he reminds us that we have a right to free speech and that we must use this right as americans.<br /><br />if you enjoy this performance, i definitely recommend watching mind of mencia, his show on comedy central.
