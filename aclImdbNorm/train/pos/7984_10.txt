man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers i have ever seen. despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. this is denzel washington's perfect role, in which he plays a body guard, called creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest prot'eg'ee, pita. dakota fanning plays pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things, and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a great future ahead of her. as i said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times.<br /><br />this film is made in two parts, there's the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing's wrong, everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of pita occurs and where creasy is almost killed. and then there's the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and "la hermamdad" that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of pita.<br /><br />denzel washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. it is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough, washington really deserved another oscar for his performance, and so did fanning and the director. and even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality.<br /><br />if you like excellent, slightly deranged, suspenseful thrillers, this is the one to see. the most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
