from the first scene you are given clues as to what may be going on here. it becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls on. the acting is excellent throughout and these actors touch your soul. even though i knew what was going to happen i was extremely puzzled by the motive. i'm still puzzled as to why ben did what he did. we could see in his face "second thoughts", but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings. it was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused. maybe that was the point of the film. i did like the film and wil smith can wrack up another good film choice. this guy knows how to entertain an audience!
