gus van sant has made some excellent films. i truly am a fan.<br /><br />however, i can't help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book "even cowgirls get the blues" is lost in translation to the big screen. alone, tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent. ultimately though this one just didn't work. <br /><br />it wasn't that the characters weren't well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive. it's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this. we're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author's precision. movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience. this is what i believe happened here.<br /><br />i suggest reading the book!
