mark frechette stars as mark, a college radical leftist. mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot, and he flees all the way to the desert. he does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flies it himself. <br /><br />once out flying over the desert, mark spots a car from the air. a young woman named daria steps out, and sees mark circling in the plane. mark swoops the plane very low several times, causing daria to duck or get hit. when he lands, he becomes acquainted with daria, who is strangely charmed by mark's aerial highjinks. <br /><br />after engaging in soulful conversation for hours, mark and daria get naked, and make love in the sand. but with mark evading the law, they realize that he needs to keep running. so mark and daria's brief tryst is quite poignant, because it doesn't get to develop into a full-blown romance.<br /><br />zabriski point was the eraserhead of the early 70s. both films have a rambling, vague quality, along with complicated meanings and characters. frechette was as reckless in person, as his character was in this film. a few years after making zabriski point, frechette robbed a bank in real life. while serving his prison sentence, mark died an ignoble death. he was killed by a 150 lb. weight, which fell on him when he was weightlifting. <br /><br />the best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography, and special visual effects. the incredible, slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion, were a stroke of genius. although not as ground-breaking a film as easy rider was, zabriski point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture. i recommend it, for those who like avant-guard films which showcase the upheaval, of the youth rebellion during the early 70s.
