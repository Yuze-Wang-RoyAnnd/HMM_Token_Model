shintar^o katsu, best known for the zat^oichi films, again stars in this third and final movie in the kenji misumi (mostly known for "lone wolf and cub), directed saga of hanzo 'the razor' itami feature the big dicked one battling ninjas, rapeing 'ghosts', and uncovering shady goings on at the shogunate treasury. the hanzo 'plot' was kinda getting stale and repetitive. what was once novel in the first film, was not any longer. fortunately, this one was better then the second thanks to having more humor. i'm just glad that they choose to stop at the one trilogy (i'm looking at you lucas) <br /><br />my grade: b <br /><br />dvd extras: merely trailers for all 3 hanzo the razor films <br /><br />eye candy: aoi nakajima unleashes both tits, mako midori just her left one
