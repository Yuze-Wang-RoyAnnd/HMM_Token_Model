"panic" is kind of a crime comedy-drama with william h. macy, donald sutherland and neve campbell in the leading roles. alex (played by macy) is a guy who kills people for living. but for the moment he's facing a depression and that's why he is seeing a therapist. that's where he meets sarah (neve campbell) and he falls in love with her. he's also facing another problem: he wants to quit the family business (the killings), but he doesn't now how to tell this to his father.<br /><br />what follows is the story of a guy during he's midlife-crisis, facing the regular problems: falling in love with a pretty young girl and everything that goes with that.<br /><br />pretty good acting performances by the cast. macy is excellent as the depressed alex. i had high expectations for this one and it was a good movie but he doesn't completely deliver. the story was rather flat and clich'e..<br /><br />7/10
