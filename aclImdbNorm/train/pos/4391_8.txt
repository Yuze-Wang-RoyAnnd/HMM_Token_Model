you're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. i rated the audie murphy movie a 3 (i'm a harsh grader), the second lowest i ever gave audie (the worst being "battle at bloody beach" if you're curious). i give this movie a rating of "8" (and i'm a harsh grader) it's the civil war story of renegade "soldiers", if you want to call them that, against the north. people like quantrell, and the men who rode with these outlaws.<br /><br />the original was a watery version, very clean cut, while still depicting the horror of what these men did. actually, movies such as the older version are best viewed by mature audiences, who can discern the story. i would be more apt to rate the original "r" and this one, with it's gruff nature, a gp, because the newer movie gives a very honest version, a message more easily deciphered by a juvenile than the older version.<br /><br />film makers since the early sixties have boasted about "realism", but few of them deliver. instead, they just give the drab scenery, drab costumes, and drab events, but with comic book cardboard stereotype characters, the weakness of the spaghetti era.<br /><br />modern film makers have realized this mistake. it is evident in a superior style of western we usually see today. this movie is an example. it gives the realistic settings, but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that era.<br /><br />it has a few lulls, which makes a complete sit through a bit hard, and it has some unexplained situations. but unexplained situations are okay as long the entire movie holds up, and the characters are intriguing enough.<br /><br />it begins a bit campy, but really improves. the main character is one we can identify, and at least have some sympathy for. the audie murphy character of the early movie really evokes no sympathy, and is too self righteous without motivation.<br /><br />the character in this movie follows the lines of a true anti-hero. there is motivation, and a method to his madness. we never feel he is truly "right", but we can understand where he comes from.<br /><br />there is plenty of action in the movie. there is also some humor. one good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she wouldn't lie to him, and he mulls that over.<br /><br />this movie succeeds in doing what film makers have been trying to do for decades. this director and writer team got it right.<br /><br />recommended. complete success.
