what is really sad, shows like six degree's and brothers & sisters are the true reality tv, not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows. i think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellation's of numerous shows with a cult following. but with the more vocal backlash the fans of jericho (which i also enjoy) and other shows, networks may start to reverse this trend. i am like others, i will not support any new shows until they have been given a second season. i'll then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via dvd's and online viewing. until then abc, you have lost me as a viewer to any new show.
