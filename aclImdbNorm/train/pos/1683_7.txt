i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty 'blood rites'. as blood rites was entirely awful, i really wasn't expecting much from this film; but actually, it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation. the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites, as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit, and of course; there is an inheritance at stake. the film is shot in black and white, and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic 'the curious dr humpp'. there's barely any gore on display, and the director seems keener to focus on sex, with themes of incest and hatred seeping through. the acting is typically trashy, but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation, director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing, as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful. the plot is paper thin, and most of the film is filler; but the music is catchy, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves, as most are somewhat erotic. overall, this is not a great film; but it's likely to appeal to the cult fan, and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality 'blood rites'.
