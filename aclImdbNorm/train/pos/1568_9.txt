catscratch is the best thing to come out of nickeloden, including wayne knight. this show doesn't just appeal to maoris and pi's. some people love it, and they're all aussies. at first glimpse i admit it seems a little crude, but it grows enormously on you. also, to correct something that one of the other critics has said in_correct (tv.com) doesn't say "does that mean you're homo now?" he says "does that mean you're homo, owww?" this is his phrase in the show. mr. blik is, i think,the funniest of all like peww-weww's playhouse<br /><br />firstly, i'll admit that the early episode were a bit good. but after a while the episodes became great! and just when the series had found it's surreal, whacky ...nickelodeon cancels it!<br /><br />i know nick is meant for kids, but every once in a while a brilliant show appears that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults. these shows include mr. bean the animated series, charlie brown, pelswick, rocko's modern life (at times), and invader zim. all of these must have been considered too good, with the exception of catdog, 'cause nick felt the need to cancel them.<br /><br />what i like the famous final episode, where gordon fight a duck.<br /><br />i'd also like to see a dvd, with plenty of audio-commentaries and behind-the-scenes docos, and including the final episode.<br /><br />but of course, what i'd definitely like to see is the show come back on the air. wake up nick!<br /><br />i wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the gag closing-credits. that would be great.
