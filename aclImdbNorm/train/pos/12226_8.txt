this is the best made-for-tv movie of all-time! am i saying this because i'm a huge silverstone fan? partially, but even without her, i'd still see it. i'm a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a great entry in that category. also, mary giordano easily ranks among alicia's top five character creations. totally memorable - like she really exists. i'd have her on my side, too, if there was a mystery to be solved. she plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete confidence in everything she does. seems sweet, honest, nice...just like she is in real life. so is that acting? yes, indeed, she's sort of a rebel once again. this time she's not bad, she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law. but she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do. instead, she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes. a cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than vigilante-style. at the time, alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. this happens here, too, but she's a bit nerdy this time around. that doesn't matter; she's still cool as a nerd. check this out soon, or else giordano will be investigating why you haven't...
