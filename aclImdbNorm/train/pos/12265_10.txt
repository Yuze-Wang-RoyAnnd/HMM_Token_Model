"tintin and i" first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary. the photography and the editing are truly breath-taking (almost anti-dogma).<br /><br />we follow the life of tintin drawer herg'e through an open-hearted interview from 1971. the tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century. in the midst of these herg'e has his own demons to fight with, and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection.<br /><br />even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums, the story of herg'e is told entirely through interviews and archive material, and never through reconstructions.<br /><br />herg'e lived the turbulent life of a true, suffering artist. but the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again.
