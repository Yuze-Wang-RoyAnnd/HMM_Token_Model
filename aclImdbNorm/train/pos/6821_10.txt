john cassavetes' 1977 film opening night is, what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist, 'overlooked'. it is an excellent film, in its own right, and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film. it's not a perfect film, in that, at two hours and twenty four minutes it's about a half hour too long, and there's a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character myrtle gordon, played by gena rowlands, the wife of cassavetes, long after we've gotten the point. but only woody allen's masterpiece, another woman, which also starred rowlands, eleven years later, is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman. yet, rowlands did win the best actress award at the berlin film festival for this portrayal, and it was well deserved. often this film, written by cassavetes, is easily compared to his earlier- and inferior- film, a woman under the influence, but it's a spurious comparison. rowlands' character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start, as well as coming from a blue collar background, while her characters in this film and in allen's film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions. in this film it's the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as myrtle's younger doppelganger, while in allen's film it's her character's own past
