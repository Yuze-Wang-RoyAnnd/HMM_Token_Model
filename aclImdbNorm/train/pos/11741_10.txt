this tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being. the irreverent pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils. the adult characters all seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so plausible and well known. when a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints. all the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. mr harvey is experiencing much pain throughout . he reminds me of war damaged teachers i did not understand when i was an irreverent pupil.<br /><br />rhidian brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped british film. the acting unblemished, the scenes appropriate, it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity.
