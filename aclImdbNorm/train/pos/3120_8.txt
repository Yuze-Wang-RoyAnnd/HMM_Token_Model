paul greengrass definitely saved the best bourne for last! i've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the blair witch project. all i have to say to that is...are you kidding me? come on it was not that bad at all. i think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which i would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. as for the rest of the movie i really didn't even notice it.<br /><br />you can tell that damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of jason bourne. sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case its a really good thing. he really becomes jason bourne in this installment. damon also has a great supporting cast in joan allen, ezra kramer, and julia stiles. david strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret cia organization.<br /><br />even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on. this film stands far above the other two bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!
