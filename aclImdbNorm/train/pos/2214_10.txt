my family goes back to new orleans late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie i knew it was a history my grand-parents never talked about, but we knew it existed. i have cousins obviously black aka african americans and others who can "pass" as white and chose not to. it's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that cane river is all a part of that history. it makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of african heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...and at the same time had i not come out of that history, i probably wouldn't be the successful business woman i am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. the acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor, but it is a movie that needed to be made. anne rice is incredible and i ask myself, why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family and i'm not. i recommend this movie to everyone. leza
