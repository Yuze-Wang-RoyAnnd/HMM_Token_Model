i had watched snippets from this as a kid but, while i purchased blue underground's set immediately due to its being a limited edition, only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule - and that's mainly because bakshi's american pop (1981) just turned up on late-night italian tv (see my review of that film below)! <br /><br />anyway, i found the film to be a quite good sword-and-sorcery animated epic with especially impressive-looking backdrops (the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were, admittedly, less so) with a rousing if derivative score. the plot, again, wasn't exactly original, but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed - especially interesting is the villainous ice-lord nekron and the enigmatic warrior darkwolf; the hero and heroine, however, are rather bland stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when bakshi and frazetta depict the girl as well-endowed (her bra could be torn off any second) and half-naked to boot (her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass)! still, it's clearly an action-oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front (that involving darkwolf being particularly savage); the final showdown though brief, is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains' lair inside a cave .<br /><br />in the long run, apart from the afore-mentioned frazetta backdrops, the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian (1982) and the beastmaster (1982) but also animated tv series such as blackstar (1981-82) and he-man and the masters of the universe (1983-85).<br /><br />as for the accompanying the making of "fire and ice" (tv) (mark bakshi, 1982) **1/2:<br /><br />vintage featurette on the sword-and-sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed-out vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself! it goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live-action 'performances' (in a studio) of segments from the script - which would then be traced, blended in with the backgrounds and filmed. still, having watched several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation (on the disney tins and the looney tunes sets, for instance), it's doesn't make for a very compelling piece...
