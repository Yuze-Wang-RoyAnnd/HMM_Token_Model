this movie has great style, fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman. it falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme.. but all in all, i would recommend this movie just because it has that good old russian feel to it.. big, impressive, powerful, bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty.<br /><br />plot: a guy who can make a blade shoot out of his hand at will (not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer) when he is really mad at you tries to have a girlfriend.. he discovers that after you kill one person with your sword hand, it's kind of hard to keep a stable relationship....<br /><br />sword boy is on the planet for a reason.. he just doesn't know what it is.. yet.<br /><br />lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting filleted creatively.<br /><br />russain w eng subtitles.. slick worth a watch..
