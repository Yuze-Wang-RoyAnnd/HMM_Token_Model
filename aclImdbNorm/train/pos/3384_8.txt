my evaluation: 8/10<br /><br />i like a lot this movie. compare to today brainless movie (just action and special effet and nothing new about ideas), "soylent green" ask to something that today doesn't exist anymore: to think.<br /><br />well it would not a big surprise a day human eat "cookies" which are create with body of human. with all what happen on this planet, and to see how people are so indifferent to all, this kind of future is possible.<br /><br />sure this movie take some age but the idea behind the movie is actual again. rich at paradise, other in the hell. well a luck today they are tv and idiocy like "reality show".<br /><br />tv is a good wash brain. it's pity to see that intelligence of human have not progress like technologies. since writing all stop.<br /><br />if you like reality show this movie is not for you. if you believe all politician same too. if you don't like ask yourself question about now and future well never look this movie.
