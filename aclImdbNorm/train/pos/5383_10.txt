i thought this movie was excellent,for the fact that corrine and sean are newcomers to the business.it was packed with action and a little romance,but there were some points when corrine didn't speak very clearly (when she threatened sean with the gun) and she clenched her teeth...maybe she was supposed to?i think the roles of joseph and sonny were portrayed very well,and there was an obvious contrast.also,because i watched next action star,i am certain that corrine and sean did their own stunts,which were performed very well.i am looking forward to another movie by the pair,as they make a great team,or perhaps a sequel to bet your life-possibly called 'making it big in the big apple',it could this time be about carmen..bet your life is excellent!
