of life in (some) colleges. of course there were artistic licenses taken, but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges.<br /><br />i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own. it's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality etc. and i can honestly say, that it's there. but the thing is when class lets out, or when they're just hanging out waiting for class, they (students) seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity. is that bad? not really. everyone needs a feeling of belonging. but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that, "we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them." otherwise you're creating your own segregation.<br /><br />racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended. one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations. fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering.<br /><br />i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen.<br /><br />so is "higher learning" overly dramatic? exaggerated? maybe. is it way "off mark?" it depends on where you went to or go to school. the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen. minus the hollywood exaggerations, the race thing hit pretty close to home for me.
