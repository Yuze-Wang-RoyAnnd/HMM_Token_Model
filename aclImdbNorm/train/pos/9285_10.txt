finally! an iranian film that is not made by majidi, kiarostami or the makhmalbafs. this is a non-documentary, an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the 'system' in its ass. it's all about football and its funny, its really funny. the director says "the places are real, the event is real, and so are the characters and the extras. this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors, as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness." the non-actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. excellently scripted, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. it has won the jury grand prize, berlin, 2006. dear reader, it's near-perfect. where, where can i get hold of it?
