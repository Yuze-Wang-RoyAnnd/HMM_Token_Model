i watched the presentation of this on pbs in the u.s. when it originally aired in 1988 (?). assuming the miniseries was available on dvd i purchased first editions of all three books last year. since then i have been searching for the series on internet movie sites. today i found this web site. i will give up the search.<br /><br />i too would like to buy this complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. after buying the dvds i would read each book, then watch the episodes for that book. that is what i did with john lecarre's karla trilogy and larry mcmurty's texas ranger trilogy.<br /><br />does anyone have any suggestions for great books or book series that became very good tv miniseries - or movie series - that are now available on dvd?
