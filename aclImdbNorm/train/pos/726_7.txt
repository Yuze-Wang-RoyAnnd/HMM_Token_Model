vince lombardi high school has a new principal--the evil ms. togar (mary woronov). she intends to ban rock and roll music all together. she butts head with riff randall (p.j. soles) who loves the ramones. also the head of the school football team (vincent van patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute kate rambeau (dey young) is in love with him.<br /><br />an instant midnight movie. this was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s. i remember attending more than a few of those when i was in college--it was like a party! people were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun.<br /><br />seeing it now as an adult i can't imagine why i loved this so much. the script is juvenile and full of groaners that i couldn't believe i was hearing. characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. what saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by soles and woronov (who is really enjoying herself). also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles way over the top (as they should). as for the ramones...i was never a fan. i do like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. if you're a ramones fan you might give this a higher rating.<br /><br />spoiler warning!!!! this is mostly for kids (it has a pg rating) who will probably find it silly but fun. i especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up! spoiler end!!!!<br /><br />so, if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this. otherwise stay away. i give it a 7.
