this movie is an amusing and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof. i was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings, especially when you think that this is zukovic's first large scale attempt.<br /><br />one warning, do not take the movie's message that seriously. it is not for mass consumption ( and that is not a compliment). the message is a somewhat stylized post-college, neophyte view of society.<br /><br />i did enjoy the basic plot line of a fictitious 'zine editor verbally whipping the mobocracy of the 90's.
