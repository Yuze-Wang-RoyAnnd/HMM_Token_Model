i've read some terrible things about this film, so i was prepared for the worst. "confusing. muddled. horribly structured." while there may be merit to some of these accusations, this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer. in fact, it actually had aspirations. it attempted something beyond the typical monster/slasher nonsense. and by god, there are some interesting things going on.<br /><br />ms. barbeau is a miracle to behold. she carries the film squarely on her shoulders.<br /><br />this is not to say that it's a masterpiece. unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition. there are just too many (unexplained) subplots trying to coexist. and the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother, then why doesn't she just kill ma in the film's very first sequence? seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do it.<br /><br />still, i give unholy points for trying. a little ambition is not a bad thing.
