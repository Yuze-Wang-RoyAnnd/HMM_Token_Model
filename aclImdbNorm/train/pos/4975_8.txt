by god, it's been a long time since i saw this. probably about 18 years ago?<br /><br />the movie tells us (kids) all about human blood and the circulatory system. very professionally put together--disney-style animation, plus human actors--it was directed by frank capra, for pete's sake!<br /><br />kind of an overkill. i wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film-strip's worth of information on the human body? but boy will those kids watching it learn: even now i can clearly remember dr. baxter being challenged by hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood, to which the doctor immediately answers "sea water."
