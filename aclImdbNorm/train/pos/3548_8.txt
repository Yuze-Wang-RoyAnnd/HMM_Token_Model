just saw this movie version of frank loesser's guys and dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before. she was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of jean simmons and marlon brando. and she thought the havana sequences where simmons and brando dance up a storm were excellent. those were pretty impressive to me too and were usually the highlights of the film. directed by joseph l. mankiewicz, this movie which originated as a story by damon runyon takes a while with the slow pacing of the non-musical scenes at first but pulls you in after a while. the other story with frank sinatra and vivian blaine wasn't as compelling to me but still had their charms especially during the "sue me" number. also loved stubby kaye's "sit down, you're rocking the boat" number and the performances of sheldon leonard and b. s. pully. with a theatrical look throughout, guys and dolls isn't a great film musical but certainly a very good one.
