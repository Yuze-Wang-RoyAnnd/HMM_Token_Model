i haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /><br />when asked about my favorite films, this is the one that i seem to always mention first. there are certain films (works of art like this film, "dark city", and "breaking the waves") that seem to touch a place within you, a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive, that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer, not unlike a life-changing event, such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend... this film "shook" me when i first saw it. it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
