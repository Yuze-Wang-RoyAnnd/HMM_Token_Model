i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. this was a good hollywood/bollywood film and i am glad it won 17 awards. parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi. jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach. jazz (parminder nagra) loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married. when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet (kiera knightlety) and joe (jonathon rhyes meyers) who is her coach. when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky (archie punjabi's) wedding. at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.
