oh dear we don't like it when our super-hero love interest develops a brain do we?<br /><br />something has happened to people, they have lost the ability to enjoy, a simple feel-good, love story/comedy? kirsten dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. i laughed out loud ooh at least five times and i'm not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too. the cast, acting and script is great, i watch a lot of films right across the board and i haven't seen one in this genre that has been as successful. those who disagree please tell me where i can find some! i'm sure the book is good too but i think you have to judge it on its own merits.
