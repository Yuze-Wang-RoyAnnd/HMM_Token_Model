this is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple. the movie portrais a couple in italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling work and family.<br /><br />the so called "culture of death" that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think.<br /><br />a must see. i hope it gets distributed as it should.<br /><br />congratulations on the cast and director.<br /><br />two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me!
