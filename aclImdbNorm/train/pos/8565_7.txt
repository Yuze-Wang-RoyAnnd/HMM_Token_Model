if you like animal movies, this movie will please. my wife likes animals and animal movies, she especially like the parrot in this film. it is geared towards kids, but i laughed at most of the humor. the french fashion character made me laugh, and adds balance to the script. it is a disney film, with its sappy, happily, family apeal, but i like leaving the theater with a positive fealing.
