"ruby in paradise" is a beautiful, coming-of-age story about a young woman, ruby lee gissing, escaping her stifling roots to become herself. although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd -- in likely her first movie role, albeit one to be quite proud of -- the emphasis is not upon becoming "somebody," a la the next madonna (whether jesus' mother or the lurid, attention-hungry singer).<br /><br />it instead emphasizes following ones' instincts and being somewhat introspective about them, to grow into one's ideal, adult self. note: this isn't an action movie!!! it uses an occasional voice-over narration (by ms. judd) while writing in her journal -- and oh, i see i've just lost the male half of the readers out there. but be patient with this beautiful movie, where we learn that one's bliss can be discovered in -- oh, i dunno, carrying water and chopping wood.<br /><br />actor/director/writer todd field, who played nick nightingale in "eyes wide shut," co-stars as ruby lee's noble love interest, one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth.<br /><br />but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee: there's no external hero imposed upon her. the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves. writer/director victor nunez, who also wrote/directed "ulee's gold," did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself -- confronting age-old challenges of good v. evil along the way.<br /><br />the supporting cast is also stellar, and the music used, particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips (whom i hear is the wife of t. bone burnett), is right on -- most especially "trying to hold on to the earth." now, when i hear the first few chords of that song, tears spring to my eyes, pavlovian and unbidden -- not sure if it's the music, or the indelible connection to the movie's quiet, charming message of empowerment.<br /><br />this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his/her way. for any woman of any age, it is a must see! the downside: it is not on dvd, except in spanish. (we learned, however, that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version, which can be readily found online. my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me.) although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on-air
