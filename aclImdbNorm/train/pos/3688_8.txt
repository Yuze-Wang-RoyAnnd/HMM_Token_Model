delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. the film is also casting some of the great actors of our time, not just from france but from everywhere.<br /><br />my favorite segments:<br /><br />14th arrondissement: carol (margo martindale), from denver, comes to paris to learn french and also to make a sense of her life.<br /><br />montmartre: there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic paris.<br /><br />loin du 16`eme: an image of paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the cit'es. ana (catalina sandino moreno) spends more time taking care of somebody else's kid (she's a nanny) than of her own.<br /><br />quartier latin: so much fun to see g'erard depardieu as the "tenancier de bar" with gena rowlands and ben gazzara discussing their divorce.<br /><br />tour eiffel: don't tell me you didn't like those mimes!<br /><br />tuileries: such a treat to see steve buscemi as the tourist who's making high-contact (a no- no) with a girl in the metro.<br /><br />parc monceau: nick nolte is great. ludivine sagnier also.<br /><br />i've spend 3 days in paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back!<br /><br />seen in barcelona (another great city), at the verdi, on march 18th, 2007.<br /><br />84/100 (***)
