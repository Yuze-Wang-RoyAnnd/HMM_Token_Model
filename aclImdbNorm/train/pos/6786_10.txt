ronald colman gives an electrifying performance as tony john, a broadway actor who can't separate his offstage life from shakespeare's othello, the character he plays on stage....two important scenes illustrate tony's dilemma. the first one takes place in producer max lasker's office. acting is a matter of talent for the practical-minded lasker. but donlan, tony's friend, disagrees: "no, no. when you do it like tony does it, it's much more. the way he has of becoming someone else every night...so completely. no, don't tell me his whole system isn't affected by it."....the other scene occurs in waitress pat kroll's apartment. tony tells her his name is martin. she thanks him. then he says: "or paul. hamlet. joe. and maybe othello."....when tony begins rehearsing othello, we learn that though he's trying to keep his real life separated from his stage life, "the part begins to seep into your life, and the battle begins. reality against imagination." he can't keep the two separated: in his mind pat is desdemona and he's othello, and he wrongly believes she has been unfaithful to him. he murders her....colman's bravura performance, in a complex and difficult role, earned him 1947's academy award for best actor. oscar nominations went to ruth gordon and garson kanin for best original screenplay. not to be overlooked is milton krasner's atomspheric cinematography.
