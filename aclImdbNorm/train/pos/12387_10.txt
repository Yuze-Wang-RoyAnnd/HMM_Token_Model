of all the movies of the seventies, none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel. i mean, yes, there were movies like the exorcist, and other ones; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. if you have time, check this one out. you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such, but this is a story worth getting into.then there are all the stars and soon-to-be stars. my absolute favorites were eli wallach, sylvia miles, and burgess meredith. then there are the subtle clues that lead to what's going on too. pay close attention. i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. plus, the books are really good as well. i'm just sorry that they're not going to turn the second book into a film. it's so scary that it would outdo this movie.
