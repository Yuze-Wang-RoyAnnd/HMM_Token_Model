running out of films to rent, i picked up freebird. i struggled through the first third of the movie wondering if the rest would be a waste to see. fortunately, it really warmed up, and i loved the movie quite a bit. the second half of the movie had me grinning and laughing the entire time. thankfully, although there were bits of cgi included, they were not overdone or prevalent.<br /><br />i would have to say, though - the actors all have heavy european accents, so be warned if you have trouble understanding those voices or their cultural humor.<br /><br />i really loved this movie, and will have to order myself a copy for my own collection.
