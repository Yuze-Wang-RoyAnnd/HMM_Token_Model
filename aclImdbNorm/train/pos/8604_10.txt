i know a lot of people don't like this movie, but i just think it is adorable. there's not much i can say, but the movie is a feel-good movie i guess. the songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie, especially as briggitta learns about the do's and don't's of society. if you like musicals, i'd say you'd like this one!
