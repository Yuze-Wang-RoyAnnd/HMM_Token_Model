for those of us baby boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate james dean et. al., martin sheen showed us the way in this great feature.<br /><br />the premise is easy enough: cool hood meets small town sheriff and all-hell ensues, but the nuts and bolts of this movie enthrall the car nut in all of us. <br /><br />no, this isn't casablanca, nor is it great literature, but it is a serious movie about cars, rebellion, and the genius that is martin sheen.<br /><br />enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is, and for what martin will become. i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the 70's, and you will too.
