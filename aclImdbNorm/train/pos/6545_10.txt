i really enjoyed this movie. most of the reviews have been bad, but most critics think a movie should be like an idea drama. this movie has a little bit of drama, but the rest is just clean fun and very entertaining. forget about julia roberts being a pretty woman, emma roberts is a beautiful young lady and there is more to her than just that. emma was so much fun to watch in the role of nancy drew. it is good to see a new face. i believe she will go far.<br /><br />nancy drew may not be based upon the books, but the story is still good. there is also a good blend of other character actors and supporting actors like pat carroll, barry bostwick, rachel leigh cook and chris kattan - not credited. i'm surprised disney did not release this movie. some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex, violence, and cursing. this is a good family film which is rare in this day in time. so take your family, see this movie and judge for your self how good it is. i can't wait for the sequel.
