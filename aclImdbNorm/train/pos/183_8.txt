exquisite comedy starring marian davies (with the affable william haines). young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom. cameo performances showcase "all the stars in mgm's heaven" in the famous commissary scene, plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar. pic also captures for posterity davies' famous, wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day (her swanson is a beaut!).<br /><br />"peggy," even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis, turns up her nose and comments, "ohh, i don't like her!"<br /><br />my print was perfect. story, direction, acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados.
