the notorious bettie page (2006) ***1/2 gretchen mol, lilli taylor, chris bauer, jared harris, sarah paulson, david strathairn, austin pendleton, norman reedus, dallas roberts. <br /><br />mol shines as legendary pin-up queen bettie page in a fine biopic.<br /><br />gretchen mol is probably best known for being tauted as the next-it-girl a few years ago when no one knew who she was despite an infamous cover story by vanity fair among other media dubbings but despite a few co-starring roles here and there her predicted stardom seemed to twinkle less brightly until now. here as the famous pin-up queen bettie page, gretchen mol is indeed a shining star on the rise.<br /><br />bettie page was tennessee born raised as a god-fearing and family oriented proper girl who seemed to find herself the unwarranted object of lust and affection, as she grew older. a gang-rape that is flashbacked is wisely not graphically depicted nor is the subtle showing of her own father having less- than-decent designs for his own kin which is important to understand how page managed to escape the possible nightmarish life for a career as an actress by heading to new york city in the 1950s when in fact that was the time and place to be to catch lighting in a bottle. what page didn't realize is that in fact she would be just that when she arrived.<br /><br />a beautiful raven haired sweetheart with a divine figure, page is spotted on coney island one summer day by a black policeman asking to take her photograph which leads to her posing in his basement and eventually to the studios of irving klaw (bauer) and his sister paula (taylor) who cater their kitschy but considered pornographic stills to a unique clientele: fetish types.<br /><br />although page is rather na"ive she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control - or at least abides in what is offered her as work in that it is not indecent and she is having fun in her increasingly less-clothed portraits - until a congressional witch-hunt seeks out a few scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. <br /><br />talented filmmaker mary harron and her screen writing partner guinevere turner ("an american psycho" and "i shot andy warhol") streamline the biopic trappings rather neatly and maybe a bit too hasty in getting at who really was bettie page although they do justice in depicting an era of uptightness at its zenith. large thanks to gifted cinematographer mott hopfel for his languorously gorgeous black and white images and also the sprinkled color segments that recall douglas sirk films of the era for its melodramatic kindlings. part feminist treaty and part american dream fulfilled the story chugs along nicely with fine performances by its ensemble including the comical bauer and taylor as siblings in smut and harris having a field day as a fellow fotog with a taste for wine and chatter. it's amusing to see strathairn in a bit of stunt casting as a senator on a campaign for righteousness after portraying news bulldog edward r. murrow in his last outing, "good night, and good luck" as an opposite the table role.<br /><br />but hats off to the truly fine talents of mol as the uninhibited yet deeply morale and most importantly intelligent bettie page who lets her child-like innocence beam through her bold nudity and now-considered-tame-and-quaint-borderline- kitschy poses that caught the male fancy for decades and is still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps the world overall. mol is perfect and uncannily resembles her portrait's subject down to her knowing-teasing smile. the real bettie page was reportedly not involved with the project but apparently gave her blessing and continues to live a somewhat secluded life that is alluded to in the final moments as to having found jesus and shirking her 'notorious' image once and for all. a shame since this film oddly embraces the resounding decency imbued within its subject, radiating for all to see in its naked splendor.
