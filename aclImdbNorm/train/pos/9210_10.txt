i feel this is one of the best movies i've seen,i'm an older male and love most westerns. i love movies based in part at least on facts,if i am not mistaken this is such a movie. i also like revenge type movies,this qualifies there as well in my opinion.some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene. i felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how i feel about the complete movie. i saw what i think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode. i also enjoyed that.i recommend taking the time to watch this movie ,i will watch it again. i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played. i thought it was so out of character for randy travis to play a villain type ,but i always enjoy his acting.
