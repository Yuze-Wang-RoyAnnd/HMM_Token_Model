surprisingly good. the acting was fun, the screenplay was fun, the music was cheesie fun, the plot was stupendously fun. this was a fun movie to watch and to give your brain some rest. parts of the plot and quotes i found to be very creative. 7 out of 10. actually for what it was, it would deserve a 10 out of 10. you are not supposed to compare this to an arthouse film or to a bloody slasher film.
