i wish "that '70s show" would come back on television. it was the greatest show ever!!! they should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing. but i wish it would come back and make more episodes. please come back... the show was absolutely hilarious. you couldn't laugh without seeing an episode. there is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when hyde and jackie were going out with each other. those were the best episodes. "that '70s show is the best".... it will be and always will be the best show ever. it was really sad when the show ended. they should make new episodes.
