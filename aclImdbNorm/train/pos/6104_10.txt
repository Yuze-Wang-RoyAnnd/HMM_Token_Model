i must admit, out of the eros movie collection, this has to be the one that i love the most as well as one other that i have also reviewed. the story is something that really keeps you watching. a lot of the eros films have a plot that looks like a hammer broke it in pieces before production when you watch it. all centering around sex, and who can get with how many different people come the end of the film. and oh dear god, never watch one of these films when someone pulls out a gun. it does not work that it is almost laughable, but you do not want to waste the energy to do so.<br /><br />"losing control" is exactly as its name comes on. the protagonist, the leading character (the wonderfully talented and beautiful kira reed). the control is the control a person has over their senses, their body and feelings. and one man changes everything for her, makes her a different woman almost. but the mirror is shattered at the same time. this makes for a great film that i wish i had come up with first!!<br /><br />10/10
