the impossible planet and the satan pit together comprise the two best episodes of the 'new' doctor who's second season. having said that, it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of quatermass and the pit (1967) to an outer space setting, with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the beast 666. these episodes cement the emotional ties between rose and the doctor, whilst also highlighting rose's increasing self-confidence, establishing her as a not-quite-equal-yet-but-getting-there partner with our beloved time lord. also of note is matt jones elegant screenplay, which decreases the occasional over-reliance on one-liners for the doctor, and the performances of the entire cast, most notably the excellent shaun parkes as acting captain zachary cross flane.
