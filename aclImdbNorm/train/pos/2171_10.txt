a real classic, ten out of ten! every actor is perfect, the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes. scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. wonder if this film is already out in dvd, because it must be seen in widescreen version. saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never since then forgot it.i remember it was one of the first warner like cinemas cope features, process called warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography. shelley winters and jack palance deserved an oscar for their performances.the only thing i could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say nicholas ray, to increase its rhythm and tension.
