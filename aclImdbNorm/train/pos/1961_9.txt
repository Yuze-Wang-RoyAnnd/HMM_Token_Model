just came back from the first showing of basic instinct 2. i was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and i was pleasantly surprised! if you liked the original basic instinct i think you will enjoy #2 just as much if not more. great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. the music is superb, reprising the original's theme. don't go expecting academy award material, go to see it for enjoyment and fun. that's what movies are designed for -- escapism. i can't think of a better way to escape than to escape with sharon stone who is as sexy as she ever was. am thinking about going to see it again this weekend. go see it!
