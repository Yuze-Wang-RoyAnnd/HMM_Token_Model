de sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but this one was a hit-and-miss for me. a grinning idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside milano. it is a detailed and sparkling story of the innocent poor masses, complete with evil capitalists and trigger-happy police forces, but slowly it evolves into a magic fantasy tale, as the boy wonder toto develops unlimited superhero powers. i had it up to here with the ever-smiling toto after 10 minutes, and when the magic took over, i was left in the dust. there were so many wonderfully orchestrated shots, so many good characters among the settlers, that i kept thinking it was a waste the movie wasn't more serious with its material. the coupling of neorealism and fantasy comes out more as an experiment of the "look-what-we-can-also-do-mum" sort than as a fully developed piece of work/art.
