in the classic sense of the four humors (which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment), altman's "h.e.a.l.t.h." treats all of the humors, and actually in very funny, entertaining ways. there's the phlegm, as personified by lauren bacall's very slow, guarded, and protective character esther brill, who's mission in life appears to be all about appearance, protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being. there's paul dooley's choleric dr. gil gainey, who like a fish out of water (perhaps more like a seal) flops around frenetically, barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness. the melancholy of glenda jackson's isabella garnell smacks of shakespeare's troubled and self-righteous hamlet -- even proffering a soliloquy or two. and let's not forget henry gibson's bile character, bobby hammer ("the breast that feeds the baby rules the world"). then there's the characters harry wolff and gloria burbank (james garner and carol burnett, respectively), relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for h.e.a.l.t.h. -- a kind of world trade organization specializing in h.e.a.l.t.h., which is to say anything but health. this is altman at his classic best.
