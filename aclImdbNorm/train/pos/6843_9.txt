writer-director brian de palma is best known for his string of films that have been called, somewhat unfairly, "hitchcock imitations." contrary to popular belief, de palma doesn't rip-off hitchcock; he borrows story or character elements that may have been seen in a hitchcock film and then expands on them in a more violent, modern way. like hitchcock, de palma is known for mixing blood-soaked death with macabre humor.<br /><br />"dressed to kill," made way back in 1980, is, perhaps, de palma's most well-known hitchcockian film, and it's probably his best as well. the story involves a cross-dressing serial killer stalking both a burnt-out housewife (played by angie dickinson) and a street-wise hooker (played by nancy allen).<br /><br />yes, it will remind you distinctly of "psycho," but de palma's flick is just as technically ingenious and darkly creative. the museum sequence is particularly well-scored and edited; the elevator stab scene is also one of the most uniquely shot murders ever put on film. "dressed to kill" may not be a complete original, but i'd say it's definitely worth your time. rated r. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
