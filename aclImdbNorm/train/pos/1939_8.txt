i don't know why i picked this movie to watch, it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different. every once in a while its good to try a film that's slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero/thriller flick and this film certainly was different. right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldn't figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real. i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end. i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors. <br /><br />at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being, and are left with the 'things are going to be ok' type of a feeling. i'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance.
