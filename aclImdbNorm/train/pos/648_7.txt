i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. i would have to say it was worth the effort. however, you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes. if you don't have the staying power, get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights.<br /><br />now to the film, what i say will contain "spoilers" and if you don't mind, here goes: <br /><br />alexandre is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo. he lives with an older woman called marie. marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex. alex spends his days at caf'es and restaurants. the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with. gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her. at this point, alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else. <br /><br />by chance, alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship. veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. marie and veronika struggles for alex's affection and had a m'enage `a trois to boot. finally at the end, it's revealed veronika is pregnant with alex's child and alex asked her to marry him. we assume (as aforesaid with gilberte's situation) alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family. there is hope! <br /><br />with the title of "la maman et la putain", i deduce jean eustache was relating to francoise lebrun's character of veronika. she was a whore and then she became the mother. hence, the mother and whore is the same person? anyway, what do i know! french films are mostly (not all) very chatty, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, insipid, lamenting and full of quotes. lebrun and l'eaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed. <br /><br />not a bad effort. 7/10.
