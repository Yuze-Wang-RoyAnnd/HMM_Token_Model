anyone who doesn't think bill and ted's bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked. it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no-brainer, but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time. one of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor, bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again. notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending, which is highly "emotional". keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best, ted theodore logan in bill and ted: the return.
