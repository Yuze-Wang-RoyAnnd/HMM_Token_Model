a lot has already been said on this movie and i' d like to join those who praised it. it's a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess of it. at points you just laugh out loud, at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch. sabu's genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie. one is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street. this sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. it is erotic and funny at the same time. another example of sabu's genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired. first one of them, the typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving. all of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost or are on track again. and at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing.so here is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which sabu manages to show throughout the film. his characters fail (do they at the end?) but he doesn't rob them of their dignity. "monday" and "postman blues" that do justice to sabu's claim that he is a genius. go watch them!<br /><br />
