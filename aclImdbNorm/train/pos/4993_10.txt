unfortunately, this film has long been unavailable (as other posters have noted), but this is one of the essential dramas of the great depression, a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a shanty-town. it features performances by spencer tracy and loretta young that are just about the finest of their careers, and it's a surpassing example of how the director, frank borzage, was able to create an almost fairy-tale aura around elements of poverty, crime, and horrendous social inequity, which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were. this film shows how love survives amidst squalor and desperate need, and it is totally life-affirming. this is a real masterpiece of the period, and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known.
