i saw this film at the taos film festival last year, and was just overwhelmed by it. it's a rich, warm novel brought to the screen, beautifully acted, and well directed. more than anything, it reminded me of the films of david lean, both in its ability to handle a complex story, and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels. the best movie i've seen in years.
