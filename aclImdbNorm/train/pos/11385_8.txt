this is your typical cheerful and colorful mgm musical from the early '50's and it's definitely on of the better ones to watch out there.<br /><br />the movie got directed by the genre expert vincente minnelli and stars gene kelly in the main lead. both did quite a few movies together back in those days, of which this one is probably their best known one. <br /><br />the movie itself actually managed to win the best picture oscar over the year, which meant it beat out movies such as "a place in the sun", "a streetcar named desire", "the african queen", "quo vadis", "the blue veil", "death of a salesman" that year. a real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful, bright and entertaining movie.<br /><br />when you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all, which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie. the musical numbers are also all nicely done, which is no big surprise when you have people such as vincente minnelli and gene kelly at work. <br /><br />but really, couldn't had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so? i mean, we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible. not that it makes the movie drag in any parts, it just makes it a bit overlong. the movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it.<br /><br />one of the better mgm musicals, that is not without its flaws though.<br /><br />8/10
