beautifully made with a wonderful performance from gretchen moll capturing such a stainless plain happiness in her work, and the recreations of the little movies and the photographs are perfectly made and often hilarious. according to harron they used film stock that is no longer produced and fifties style studio lighting even for the outside locations to give the colour portions its distinctive look. bettie page saw the movie at hugh heffner's house (she is now eighty-three) with the producers there, but not the director, in case it got awkward if she didn't like it. she apparently did like it up until the official inquiry, which she found unsettling. some great costumes too. the idea for the movie started in 1993, but this was worth the wait. the portrait of her never seems to ring false in reference to all those images and snippets of (dreadful) movies that many of us will have already seen. it would make an interesting companion piece with goodnight and goodluck, but much more pleasant viewing!
