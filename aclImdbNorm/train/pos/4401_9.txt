ride with the devil directed by ang lee(crouching tiger) is another gem in this fine directors cap. for those unfamiliar with the history of the kansas-missouri border wars during the american civil war. see this film & you will visit a sad piece of americana. besides some superb action scenes (quite bloody at times). this is a story of love & devotion between men & one lady in particular. it stars toby maguire, skeet ulrich jeffrey wright & as the young lady jewel, i never heard or seen her before, i want to see more of her).the acting is top notch, superb production values, very well written (adapted from a novel)<br /><br /> this is a long film 128 minutes, but well worth seeing.<br /><br /> my rating is ****<br /><br /> respectively submitted<br /><br />jay harris<br /><br />
