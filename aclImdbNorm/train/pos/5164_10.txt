i attended camp chesapeake. it was located at the head of the chesapeake bay on the north east river in md. it was a similar type summer camp with cabins. it was established by the coatesville, pa ymca. i started out as a young camper and later became a junior, senior counselor and later, the waterfront director. if the camp had continued, i would have done anything within my power to become the camp director. alas the powers of the ymca decided to close down the camp and sell it to the state of md. i visited the former camp some years later by boat and was dismayed by the neglect of the state of md and natural destruction by mother nature. the 350 acre site served so many with all the benefits of contact with natures offerings. a black man by the name of curtis ford, and his family were residents and caretakers of the property. mr curtis was my friend and mentor. i idolized his every being. even as he could not swim he was a waterman. if i asked him where the fish were biting, he would designate the spot, and i would have a ball. ther was also a family camp at the end of the summer. these memories will be with me for eternity.
