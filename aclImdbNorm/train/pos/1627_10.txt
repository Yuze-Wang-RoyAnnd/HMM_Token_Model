blonde and blonder has pamela anderson and denise richards in almost every scene and if you want more from a movie you're being utterly unreasonable. it feels like a late era carry on, when the series was no longer blazing trails, but was still more funny than not, think behind or england and you won't be too far off the mark. pamela and denise are bubbly, charming and clearly aware this isn't a masterpiece they're making, although you can give me it over lots of things i'm told to like. the supporting cast are energetic, even if some of them aren't particularly good; i can't see a couple of duff turns in a movie that's already practically forgotten making much difference to anything, so just smile. i really do think blonde and blonder is ace and i hope you hate me for it.
