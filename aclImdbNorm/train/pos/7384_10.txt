whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year. she is hilarious. of course there was a major serious side to the show. she was great not only because she's funny, but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum. white folks need to be reminded that hollywood awards' ceremonies, employment, and representation are way out of balance racially. there should be no need for "black" awards shows. the white-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of poor taste. he had no business being there. the fact of the matter is, this is the first oscar presentation i've watched since "the color purple" was up for awards. that miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002. which is not to denigrate other presenters. billy crystal is a riot.
