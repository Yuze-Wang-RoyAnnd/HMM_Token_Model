i first flicked onto the log accidentally one night while waching television: since then, i have never missed an episode.<br /><br />it's humour is very weird, like a cross between brass eye's social commentary, the fast show's excellent one-liners, and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere. the best example of this was hillary briss's special stuff - what was that all about?<br /><br />the humour will not appeal to all. some will say it's just too sick, and it's easy to see where they're coming from. nonetheless, give it a try. if you don't like it, don't watch it, but if you do like it you'll be very glad you took my advice.
