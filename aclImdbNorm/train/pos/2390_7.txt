my 2 year old likes the doodlebops show, it seems to keep his attention for awhile. the characters are interesting, vibrant with primary colours and all. there's not much educational content that the intended target audience could benefit from, but they do seem to have a theme each show and try to teach kids about sharing and respect and other basics, so i like it for that. it's well produced with high production values. but it's really just an average show like most of the shows on tv these days. we don't buy into the merchandise angle and have our son wearing everything dooblebop. i don't think we'd spend money to go to a live show, if they ever came to town. going to the zoo or the science centre is a far better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion is money better spent.
