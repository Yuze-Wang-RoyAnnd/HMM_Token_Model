i was never a big fan of television until i watched 24 for the first time. i got into the series very late. season 5 ended before i even saw my very first episode. it was an episode of series 3 that was on my parents dvr (digital video recorder) box while i was house sitting for the weekend. it took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of jack bauer. and boy was i hooked!! i watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. the next day i went to blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money i've ever spent. i watched the first three seasons in three weeks. that's 72 forty minute episodes!!! i will say that finding out what happens next is easier on dvd than waiting an entire week. i can only imagine the anticipation of watching season 6 week to week!! i find it mildly torturous and cruel but i'm going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of america!! the dvr is set and you can bet i'll be chomping at the bit!!
