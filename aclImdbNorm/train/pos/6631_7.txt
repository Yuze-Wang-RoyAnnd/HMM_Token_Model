i have no idea how to describe this movie, and also would love to provide others the same opportunity i had - seeing it with no prior knowledge of what to expect. i enjoyed it immensely but can also say i barely understood what was going on, if in fact there was anything to understand in the first place. fans of david lynch (tangentially) or especially guy maddin films should particularly enjoy this, and any fans of the comic book eightball will probably be beside themselves with joy and wonder (it came as close as any film i've seen to the tone and mood dan clowes creates so effectively).<br /><br />one slight note just to warn anyone easily offended - this movie, if rated, would be nc-17 for sure. fans of male full-frontal nudity, however...hmm, well...yes. this is weird wild stuff.
