a great movie, rather challenging than really entertaining. sadly, no memorable quotes here, but this one's my favorite: alexandre: if you're leaving someone that you have loved, you have to say what i'm telling you now: "farewell, i'm going." but to disappear, to hide like a criminal, is ignoble. (didn't watch it with english subtitles)<br /><br />in my opinion, this expresses it all. there is so much tactics involved in the relationships between alexandre and the others, and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth. however, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as alexandre experiences. common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of "liberated love" by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved. it does, indeed, show this in a convincing manner, but i would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a bit more in depth: it's not that liberated love is in itself doomed to failure, but people (especially men, i think) should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morals before and not through practicing liberated love.<br /><br />that said, the movie's realistic though and really worthwhile watching.
