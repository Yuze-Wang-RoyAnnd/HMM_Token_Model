i don't have much to add to what has been said before, but it's very much a film of it's time, and the first (and likely only) time that the studio hung the film totally on the dead end kids.<br /><br />the warner's gave the boys plenty of help, from director ray enright and an 'a' budget, to an almost magical cast of supporting actors. at every turn, we get one of those gem performances from real pros. they are too many to list, but it seems like just about everybody on the warner's lot (sans the very biggest stars) walk through this picture. (see if you can spot john ridgely)<br /><br />the only over the top performance is from the always reliable eduardo cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex. he plays this character almost exactly like that of the thuggie leader in "gunga din". he's something to watch! and marjorie main is excellent and gets her best role since "dead end".<br /><br />my bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like "city for conquest".<br /><br />hooray for warners!
