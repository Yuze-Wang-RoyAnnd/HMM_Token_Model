this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film (along the lines of tales from the crypt) written by robert bloch (author of psycho). it's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast. the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee (the third doctor) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star!
