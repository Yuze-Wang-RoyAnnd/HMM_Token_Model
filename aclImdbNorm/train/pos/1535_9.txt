thankfully as a student i have been able to watch "diagnosis murder" for a number of years now. it is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his lapd son, a young doctor and a pathologist. dm provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. what made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing. the main cast gave good performances and dick van dyke's entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic, dance and humor. the best aspects of dm was the fast pace, witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score. sadly it has been unfairly compared to "murder, she wrote". dm is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. now it is gone tv is a worse place. gone are the days of feelgood, family friendly cop shows. now there is just depressing 'gritty' ones.
