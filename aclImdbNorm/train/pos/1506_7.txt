before films like 'the texas chainsaw massacre,' 'suspiria,' and 'halloween' changed the view of horror forever, there was a more gothic and far less violent era in the genre. films like the hammer horror series and 'rosemary's baby' were what scared and thrilled audiences throughout the 60s and early 70s. i can't tell you how many times i rented this film during my childhood, but i did because there was something about it. i didn't want to limit myself to the slasher and zombies movies of the 70s and 80s and films like this production from the famous, but sadly long gone amicus film company were a good start.<br /><br />pros: a grand, eerie music score. strong performances from a stellar cast. brilliant cinematography. plenty good old fashioned thrills and chills, especially in the first and last vignettes. some haunting moments and images. moves at a slow, but stead pace. the house is one spooky, oppressive dwelling. great production design and set decoration, which give the film a real old gothic horror feel. depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on gore and gratuitous nudity for it's thrills.<br /><br />cons: some pacing issues in the first half. aside from the 'the cloak,' the rest of the stories feel like they've been done before. clich'es galore. the second story, 'waxworks,' has fine acting and it's moments, but is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense. the low budget really shows at times.<br /><br />final thoughts: after seeing this film for the first time in many years i can see why i rented it so frequently. it's not a masterpiece by any means, but it's a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. watch this one with the lights off.<br /><br />my rating: 3.5/5
