john carpenter's halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers, who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters.<br /><br />this was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise. carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters; unusual for a horror picture.<br /><br />even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date. get that! <br /><br />halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasance's career. a true classic.
