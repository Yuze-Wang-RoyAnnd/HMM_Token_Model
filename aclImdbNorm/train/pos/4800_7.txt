i went into the straight story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting. these i got. what i wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence. leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.<br /><br />if you didn't notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion.<br /><br />i only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.
