okay, that was a pretty damn good episode. much better than the credit it receives.<br /><br />the camera work is splendid. best yet. i love that final shot. the atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great and the guest cast (minus the helpless victims) is strong. <br /><br />what i don't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained. why does it change sex? what's the purpose? and they're aliens? what kind? why were they never shown again in the later mythology?<br /><br />i'm giving this episode a high three stars. one of my favorites yet, but the plot holes bother me. still... not gonna let it ruin my entertainment.
