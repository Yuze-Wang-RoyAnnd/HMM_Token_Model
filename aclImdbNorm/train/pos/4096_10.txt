perhaps it's me and my perverted ways, or the fact that i tend to have a very sick mind, but i rented this film at random one very weird night and to my great surprise, i enjoyed it. <br /><br />yes, i read the synopsis on the back of the dvd box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured i was prepared for anything it would offer. i was clearly deceived after seeing...well...everything, to cut a long story short. i can see why it was banned, not only for such explicit sex scenes, but for beastiality. <br /><br />of course, as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of beauty and the beast, a personal favorite of mine, it tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening over a dream about a duchess being chased by a whatever-the-hell-that-thing-was-like beast with an enormous erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation. of course, the beast gets what he wants and the duchess decides she likes it and they continue frolicking in the woods. <br /><br />but that's not all. oh, there is so much more! <br /><br />not only do we get to see interspecial sex, but there's also humping horses, the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she's not humping the bed to get her...er...satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbating with rose petals. <br /><br />creative and enjoyable, but it did take a while for my father to talk to me again after he watched it after i went to bed...i was 15. words of advice when watching this film: make sure you're the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed. it may be fun, but i doubt there are other porn films like this one.
