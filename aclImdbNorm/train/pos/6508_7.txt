i grew up watching scooby and have been a fan forever. this cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can get boring to viewers. the crooks in mask routine gets old and this cartoon is a change from that. it's not meant to replace the scooby gang it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers i'm sure. the cartoon's focus is on scooby and shaggy who inherits a large sum of money and use that money to thwart world conquest plans from a mad scientist and his goons. small homages of the gang and the gang themselves are featured from time to time. if you are a fan of scooby-doo you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog, along with the jokes that come with it. just enjoythe cartoon and support the creators/writers and producers so that this won't be the last scooby cartoon.
