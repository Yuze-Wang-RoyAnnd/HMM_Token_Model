casting jack cassidy as ken frankin was sheer brilliance. cassidy personified arrogance, confidence, charm and wit - all with a condescending, evil little smirk on his face. in my opinion, jack cassidy is by far the best murderer (having appeared three times) in the columbo series. this particular (and first) performance, is my favorite columbo episode ever - hands down. a fresh faced steven spielberg did amazing camera work (yes, there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at times)capturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between columbo and franklin. also, the panoramic and tight in shots at big bear lake, ca (franklin's cabin home) were very impressive.<br /><br />if you have not yet seen this episode, then you owe it to yourself to do so - it's a true masterpiece.<br /><br />jack cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. his charismatic personality was highly infectious. his death in 1976, at age 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic - he surely had his best years ahead of him. rest in peace jack, you will live on for eternity through your great work.
