i wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history......i was hooked. the premise was pretty simple; two hardened nemesis agents, richard barrett and craig stirling ( william gaunt and stuart damon) are partnered up with an expert (if not young) doctor and biologist (sharron macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china. whilst making their escape, their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio, thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come...<br /><br />the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived, one season run that has set it up for cult status.<br /><br />monty berman, the producer, was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in episodes such as "happening" ( a studio deputising for the australian outback) and the 'snow' sets of "operation deep freeze" and "the beginning" but if you can get past this, and focus on the characters and the story lines, the show was really a lot of fun. it had a great mix of adventure, and plenty of deadpan humour (mainly from some terrific one liners from william gaunt).<br /><br />the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig!!). they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. i have to say, i was always a richard barrett fan - i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn't cross, and those eyes........the bluest eyes you would probably see on tv. i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since. however, craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too.<br /><br />the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with, including donald sutherland, jeremy brett, peter wyngarde, burt kwouk, anton rodgers, kate o'mara, jenny linden, paul eddington and colin blakely.<br /><br />notable episodes for me were : "auto kill", "the interrogation", "the fanatics", "the mission" and "the gilded cage" but i am sure every one has their personal favourites.<br /><br />if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time, or to re watch it after many years, remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don't think i will ever tire of it.<br /><br />enjoy!
