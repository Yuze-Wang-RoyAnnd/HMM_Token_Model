this is one of those films that explore the culture clash of eastern born people in westernized cultures. <br /><br />loving on tokyo time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences. ken, rock n'roll fanatic, marries kyoto, a japanese girl, so that she can stay in the united states when her visa expires. the marriage is only expected to be temporary, that is, until kyoto gains legal status again. but, ken, who seems to be lost in every relationship, takes a liking to kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out. this, despite his friend's urging that dumping kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n' roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that.<br /><br />but kyoto comes from a strict traditional japanese upbringing, and doesn't expect to be married to ken all that long. not only that, she is homesick and wants to return to japan. it's sad in that this is finally someone ken thinks he can love and be with and all that, except the one time he thinks he's found someone to feel that way about, the girl isn't expecting to stay that long. it's not that she doesn't like ken, it's just that she's used to a whole 'nother way of life. she says, "i can't tell him the way i feel in english, and ken can't tell me the way he feels in japanese." it's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno-nintendo soundtrack.<br /><br />i picked up loving on tokyo time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films, tokyo pop. and, for those of you who enjoyed loving on tokyo time, check out tokyo pop (a new york singer goes to japan and joins a japanese american cover band), except it's a movie with a happy ending.<br /><br />
