good western filmed in the rocky arizona wilds. lots of tough guys throughout; cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type. several holes appeared in the picture, but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing. one really dumb scene shows heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. a. to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. b. the grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip?
