perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing, albeit, completely corny, to adults. not a bad film for a low-budget job. children will be amazed with santa's workshop and the "magic" that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small, or homes that have no chimneys at all!<br /><br />kids will thrill over the santa's success at thwarting the nasty devil named pitch (complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail!). they will sympathize with the poor little girl who's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love. and the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents. and what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by pitch to help capture santa and ruin christmas? in the end, everyone, including the nasty boys, get just what they deserve for christmas!<br /><br />the film will endear children to both santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world.<br /><br />
