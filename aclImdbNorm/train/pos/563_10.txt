the penultimate collaboration between director anthony mann and star james stewart (excluding the few days mann worked on night passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances), the far country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption, fighting it every step of the way. this time he's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by john mcintire's larcenous judge of the roy bean school of law and order. stealing them back and taking them across the canadian border, he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims...<br /><br />while it's no great surprise which way stewart turns at the end, he's a surprisingly callous critter along the way, even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it's not his problem. for most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and mcintire, something the judge recognises immediately, revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him. in many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too - despite their appeals to his dead-and-buried better nature, there's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is.<br /><br />as usual with mann there's an exceptional use of high country locations, though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground, and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from walter brennan, harry morgan and ruth roman (though corinne calvert's young romantic interest veers to the irritating). sadly the great cinematography of the canadian rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average dvd transfer, with only the theatrical trailer as an extra.
