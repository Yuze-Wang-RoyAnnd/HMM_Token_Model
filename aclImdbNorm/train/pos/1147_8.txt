soapdish may go down as one of the single most under-rated movies ever made.<br /><br />a stellar, unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it. while everyone hammed it up, there was no one-upmanship. kline showed wit and great physical comedy, goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking, i could just go on.<br /><br />do not pass this movie by!
