dirty sanchez is the more extreme, british version of jackass in which the four boys (pritchard, dainton, joycey and pancho) go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other. the reason this show is better than jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny. there are 3 series of the show, the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg. there's an episode on their love lives,jobs etc. the second series sends the boys to try out different occupations. the third follows their european tour. it seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series. in my opinion the third series is the best, but trust me when i say, if you have a week stomach do not watch, as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode.
