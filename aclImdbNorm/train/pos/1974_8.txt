i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy. no one cared when the golden girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle. let's face it, she looks good, she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age! it's not an oscar or a cult classic like the first, but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. as such, it never claims to be either. it's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. it's the character of catherine trammell that helped give way for this sequel. fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen.<br /><br />the cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to britian for sure. the score is amazing as well.<br /><br />sure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from david morrissey who's virtually unknown.<br /><br />there's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop. as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty-pleasure raunchiness that the story is known for.<br /><br />at the very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it, and that's the movie's only intentions. so if you've got beef with mizz stone, maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit?
