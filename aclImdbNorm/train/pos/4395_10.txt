one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me. not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars, e.g., tobey maguire (before spiderman), skeet ulrich (before jericho), jonathan rhys meyers (before tudors), james caviezel, simon baker, mark ruffalo, jeffrey wright, tom wilkinson, and jewel. all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.<br /><br />when the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films. however, it is seldom every seen on cable. i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known.
