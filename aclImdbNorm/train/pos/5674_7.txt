this time around, blackadder is no longer royal(or even particularly close to being any such thing)... instead, rather a butler to the prince regent, portrayed by hugh laurie(who replaces tim mcinnerny, who presence is sorely missed, and that hole is never filled... his character had an innocent charm... while he was a bumbling and complete moron, we can't help but care for him, which isn't at all true of his replacement) as being intolerably daft(which he apparently was, according to the trivia page), not to mention loud-mouthed and utterly non-threatening. edmund can now do just about what he pleases, and does so. why is he so frustrated and angry(honestly, it gets depressing at times)? yes, his master is a buffoon, they always are. he doesn't seem to lack money, nor is he in any danger. in the second series, the queen was mischievous and childish, and would cut off someone's head - or marry them - on a whim. here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting. there is still commentary and even a little satire. too often, it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own, so they merely restate it, not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags. and i can't tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done, literally more than a minute away. it's not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered. baldrick doesn't change from last season... he's still rather pathetic and stupid, leading to "silly" humor. frankly, the amount goes through the roof. don't get me started on the gross-out stuff. the sarcastic, verbal wit can still be great, though much less of it is than before. i'd say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny, while the other three didn't really get me into them at all. i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were... i could see many of such coming a mile away. some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced. this continues with the tradition started by "ii" of letting the plans work out occasionally. the theme is the worst of the bunch, the credits sequences the least creative. all in all, this is, by far, my least favorite of the four. i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general. 7/10
