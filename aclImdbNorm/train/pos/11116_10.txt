"the godfather", "citizen kane", "star wars", "goodfellas" none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of "the sopranos". each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity, completely and utterly three dimensional. we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly, despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs. evil, he is evil. soprano is the most provocative, intricate, and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history. if you're in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer, and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment, watch "the sopranos". i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season 1, and not want to continue with the series. each season is completely brilliant in its own way. dvds are essential to anybody's collection **** of out 4
