i collect horror films from all over and i have seen the good and the very bad - zombie bloodbath is a low budget video. sure, the acting is bad, the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots. the thing you seem to be missing is that it's still entertaining and really very fun. the effects range from, like someone on here has said, pasty-faced zombies that look like kiss rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work. but the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area. the effects are very good for such a small film. someone called it a party movie and it is. 100% fun party movie. i have heard from various websites that this is actually a "rough cut" of the film that got general release but the actual "director's cut" is coming on dvd and it is very nice quality. i will buy it and judge for myself.<br /><br />story is basically a nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies. the gov't closes it down, hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it. some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area. a few actors do a great job, there's some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true, good music, great lighting, some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore. one guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up, if you know what i mean. then his guts are shoved out of his mouth. another is torn in half like in day of the dead and they did a great job of that effect. there are a million gore gags and it's almost all action. i say stop being a prude, enjoy life and get more movies like zombie bloodbath and meat market. two great undead epics.<br /><br />ok - update!!! i just got the dvd set and here is what i thought:<br /><br />much better picture quality and for once i was able to see the actual director's cut of the film and it is a much better movie. i liked it before, but now i can see what todd sheets was actually trying to do with this one. and the commentary helps too, hearing sheets talk about the film in detail, he knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to all people involved. also, sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well. i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like cnn, fox and mtv. over all, a fun little film that is very rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! i have seen many dv films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't. while newer dv films are technically superior, they just aren't this much fun!<br /><br />ps - i heard they are now remaking this on a big budget???
