of all the british imperialist movies like four feathers, charge of the light brigade for example, this movie stands out as the cream of the crop. it reflects a time when "the sun never set on the british empire." get over it. i won't go into why because so many others have expressed the many reasons that makes this film great. i have visited the alabama hills and have photographed the pass through which the british marched and it remains as it was, unchanged by time and encroachment by man and vandals. and even though i know it's coming, seeing din lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read <br /><br />"yes, din! din! din!<br /><br />you lazarushian-leather gunga din!<br /><br />though i've belted you and flayed you,<br /><br />by the livin' gawd that made you,<br /><br />you're a better man than i am, gunga din" <br /><br />i still, at 54 years of age, get misty eyed and anyone who says they don't is a liar. the range of emotions within it is the mark of a great movie. like the ending of another great film, of mice and men.
