alexandr "sascha" luzhin (john turturro) is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italy-hosted tournament. his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life. natalia (emily watson) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother, vera (geraldine james) to scope out possible marriage partners. vera leans toward a handsome count but, astonishingly, natalia is more fascinated by sascha, whom she met on a walk. sascha, too, is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting. but, with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and, with other happenings in his past still causing problems, will he win the heart of natalia? oh, and can he become the chess champion, also? this is a lovely film, based on a novel by nabokov. the acting is amazing, with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy, awkward chess enthusiast. james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well. as for the look of the film, it could not be better. the scenery is of the put-your-eye-out variety, the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause. yes, the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks, at times, making it a film not everyone will appreciate. then, too, the ending is bittersweet. however, if you love romance, period pieces, great acting, knockout scenery, or the fine art of motion picture creation, don't miss this one. you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms.
