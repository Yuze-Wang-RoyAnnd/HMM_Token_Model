paulie sounds like the most saccharine, lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find, yet it's actually much better than you might expect. the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film, but actually in most other departments the film is charming.<br /><br />in case you're wondering, paulie is a parrot. bought for a little girl with speech difficulties, paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons, and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself. however, paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from n.y.c to l.a to be re-united with her.<br /><br />so, why does this awful-sounding film succeed relatively well? firstly, it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. secondly (and far more significantly) it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving, often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline. thirdly, it has several surprisingly strong performances, including jay mohr as a wily crook, gena rowlands as a kind old lady, and cheech marin (yes, the dope-smoking cheech marin!) as a musical immigrant. it might not be a classic, but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages.
