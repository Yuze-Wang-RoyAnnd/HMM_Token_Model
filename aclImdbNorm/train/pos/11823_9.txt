i thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the dick tracy persona. this is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story. if you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old dick tracy b&w movies then you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition. the pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it's meant to be. i personally find madonna's musical element to be a major part of this film-the cd featuring her music from this movie is one i've listened to often over the years, it's just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era. in my mind, madonna's finest moment both on-screen but especially musically. this is sure to bring out the "kid" in you.
