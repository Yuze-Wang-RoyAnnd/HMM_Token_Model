everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes christopher walken.<br /><br />in vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of pows, including christopher walken. following a mad max 3 (!) thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. walken and some colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />cut to the present (1991), and colombian guy is leading a revolution against el presidente. he's successful at first, but after el presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly, which leads walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />mcbain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh, and action packed too. this is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in new york without the police bothering.<br /><br />there's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here, from michael ironside's diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in america (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).<br /><br />it's out there for a quid. buy it if you have a sense of humour. see how many times you can spot the camera crew too.
