joan crawford had just begun her "working girl makes good" phase with the dynamic "paid" (1930). she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed. so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering (because they were clinging to characters that had been the "in" thing a few years before but were now becoming passe) joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress. the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon. of course, if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it - that was alright.<br /><br />this film starts out with a spectacular house boat party. bonnie jordan (joan crawford) is the most popular girl there - especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear!!! however, when bonnie's father has a heart attack, because of loses on the stock market, both bonnie and her brother, rodney (william bakewell) realise who their real friends are. after bob townsend (lester vail - a poor man's johnny mack brown) offers to do the "right thing" and marry her - they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared (with abandon) that she wants love on approval - she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job.<br /><br />she finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well. her working buddy is bert scranton (cliff edwards) and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob. rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job. she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer, jake luva (clark gable). rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces, "spilling the beans" to the first person he sees drinking at the bar - which happens to be bert. he is then forced to kill bert and after- wards he goes into hiding. the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find bert's killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jake's clubs. (joan does a very lively dance to "accordian joe" - much to sylvie's disgust). the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying, bonnie tearfully phones in her story.<br /><br />this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all. natalie moorehead, who as sylvie shared a famous "cigarette scene" with gable early in the film, was a stylish "other woman" who had her vogue in the early thirties. william bakewell had a huge career (he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid 20s). a lot of his roles though were weak, spineless characters. in this film he played the weak brother and was completely over-shadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable - maybe that was why he never became a star.<br /><br />highly recommended.
