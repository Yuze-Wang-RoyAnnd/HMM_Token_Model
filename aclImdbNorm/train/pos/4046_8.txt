rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of grace elliot, an englishwoman who stayed in france during the apex of the french revolution. one always suspected that rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary. if you can put aside rohmer's unabashed defense of the monarchy (and that is not an easy thing to do, given that, for instance, the french lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts), this is actually an elegant, intelligent and polished movie. lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century france, rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards. it is a blatantly artificial conceit, but it somehow works. and newcomer lucy russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be.
