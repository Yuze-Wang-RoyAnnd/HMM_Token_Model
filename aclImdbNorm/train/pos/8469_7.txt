i generally love these 1930 mystery/police charlie chan type of movies, and this is no exception. however, something seems bad with this movie. a late attempt to switch from cerebral moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving as sore feet. a typecast buffoon appears from nowhere impersonating a clumsy englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem entangled into providing comedy relief. the plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today, but back then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real, but a commonplace occurrence.
