keep in mind i'm a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time. how i've overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me. to me this is a better film then the much lauded "high noon". it's a great western with excellent acting and a great story. the dvd is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography. if you like westerns or james stewart this film is not to be missed.
