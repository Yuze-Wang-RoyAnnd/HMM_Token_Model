hardcastle and mccormick is an excellent tv show. <br /><br />yes, it is predictable much like the dukes of hazzard, hunter, the a-team, etc etc etc.<br /><br />this show is just good clean television. the relationship between hardcastle and mccormick is quite amusing. they often take jabs at each other several times an episode, which adds a great deal of humor to the show. it contains several car chases in almost every episode, but, who doesn't enjoy a good car chase? especially with the coyote! <br /><br />i only wish they made clean television like this today i highly recommend this!
