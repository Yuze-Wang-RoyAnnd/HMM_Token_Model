this is a brilliant political satire. no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u.s.: it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.<br /><br />another good film from this era, rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, accurately, that the u.s. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.<br /><br />a clever plot, good acting, some big stars (john cusack, ben kingsley, marisa tomei anyone?) and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit. unfortunately, americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.
