tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle. some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization. but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave. one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back...even if that means killing tarzan.<br /><br />this is a rarity--a sequel that's better than the original. "tarzan, the ape man" of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged. this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult. there is tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot to death point blank--and no one really cares) but this was 1934. there's also plenty of blood, gore and violence (for a 1934 movie) and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude! there's also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and (it's implied) they sleep together and have sex--without being married. this wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme.<br /><br />that aside, the movie is well-directed, very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement. seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane's outfit is pretty revealing too. i still think maureen o'sullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan. everybody else is ok.<br /><br />this is easily the best weismuller--o'hara tarzan out there. well worth seeing but not for kids!
