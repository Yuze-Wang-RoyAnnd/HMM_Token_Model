although the movie is clearly dated, audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale. buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages: the stone age, the roman age, and the moden age, playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different "ages". in this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the "caveman" stereotype, who wins his love not by romance but by brute force, as well as a funny twist on roman gladiatorial combat, two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as mel brooks' "history of the world: part i". the underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing: although the times may have-a-changed, we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to "win the girl" (keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 america, a time when chauvinism was still en vogue). it is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later, and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's "modern times" to now.
