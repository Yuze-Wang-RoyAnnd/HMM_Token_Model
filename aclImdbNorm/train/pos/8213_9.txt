anyone witness to our justice system - or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying. there weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society. the popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby-pamby, lily-livered, melee-mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of "political correctness". <br /><br />the performances across the board were compelling. i sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same, found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug, vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers. in particular, i found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films i've seen, so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good. the lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fitting that dirty harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end. this was the only sequel in the dirty harry saga that equaled the first.
