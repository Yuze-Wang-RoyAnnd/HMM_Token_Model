any one who has seen mel gibson's the passion of the christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead. though it wasn't a success in th box office or tv ratings, the fox movie channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually. i liked the way that they trained chris sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in hebrew.though sarandon didn't have long hair like any other jesus would in other films, his looks are pretty close to what a jewish man would appear. what surprised me or startled me was the scene where caiaphas told jesus about pilate "and don't ever forget, that you are a jew!" though that may have not been a racist remark,colin blakely was trying to make chris sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days.keith michell's portrayal of pilate was hulking, comparing with his previous performances in "the story of jacob and joseph" and "the story of david". but if you compare his portrayal of pilate with telly savala's or hurd hatfield, you can say that he really painted well the impression of a roman procurator.
