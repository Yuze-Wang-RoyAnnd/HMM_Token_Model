how to lose friends & alienate people is in all honesty one of the best comedies i've seen this year along with pineapple express and step brothers. its not one of those "gross out" comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at an affable pace and you will be easily attached to the unfolding narrative. simon pegg nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish-out-of-water character and is quickly detaching himself from the tripod he once belonged to back in england (the other two would be nick frost and edgar wright). getting yourself in the top of the hollywood food chain is a hard thing to do as we can clearly see with pegg, his first jab at the lead role was david schwimmer's comedy run fatboy run but it received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences alike. his second try is this movie, got fairly positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office. i, for one still haven't lost faith in him and i'll still be there whenever he wants to take that third shot for glory.<br /><br />other characters were well cast from jeff bridges to danny huston and gillian anderson. surprisingly, kirsten dunst in my opinion fared well in this movie as the love angle to pegg's character however, the spark that i saw in interview with the vampire is still lost. she needs to find it, fast or she might suffer the consequences of being lost in the land of "rom-coms" forever.
