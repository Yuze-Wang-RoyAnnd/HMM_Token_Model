this is a feel-good movie and nothing more. and for that, it is great fun to watch. sure it skims over political issues. but so what? i am sure she wasn't trying to make 'good night and good luck' here. let's not try to make it anything else but what it is...light fare. <br /><br />and very enjoyable at that!<br /><br />do we remember what 1984 was like? we've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not. i tend to differ on this point. goldie knew this was fun-fluff and she went ahead and did it.<br /><br />like her lightest fare: protocol, overboard, housesitter, wildcats, private benjamin, seems like old times, foul play, death becomes her, first wives club and the remake of out-of-towners, goldie knows what she is doing...she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it! goldie just knows herself really well, and she knows what she can do really well.<br /><br />she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently. i loved her in laugh-in and every thing she's ever been in. she has never tried to be anything else but who she is...and that's that bubbling, giggly, girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you've just got to lighten up because before you know it...you are old, wrinkled and suffering from one of life's inevitable ailments. if it even comes that late.<br /><br />i appreciate goldie for what she is: a lovable, comic actress.
