the movie is absolutely silly.<br /><br />but were you expecting a high-brow intellectual film based on a comic called slam dunk? really? jay chou's acting isn't exactly the most moving thing i've ever seen, but i certainly enjoyed the movie. was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like jet li or stephen chow can produce? no, not really. was it thoroughly entertaining if you're just taking it at surface value? absolutely. it's a movie about some chinese eye-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. there's an evil triad-style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets jay chou involved in all of this. a love interest. it's formulaic but really, suspend disbelief for a while. come on. it's called kung fu dunk. what do you really think you signed on for? do yourself a favor if you watch it - i found myself a copy with some engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise, but we got a great laugh out of it. they would appear to be extremely fixated on jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10.<br /><br />i laughed, i cried, i hurled. i'd watch it again.<br /><br />especially for that fight scene in the bar. well choreographed and well shot. i especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table - i'd love to play on one of those.<br /><br />slick enough for me, but i dig on trash cinema.
