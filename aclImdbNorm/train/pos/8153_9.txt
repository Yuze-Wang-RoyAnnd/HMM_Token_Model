this is a really funny film, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch it. it's a pretty short film, and i definitely recommend watching it more than once, you will 'get it' more the second time.<br /><br />it's like spinal tap but the rap version. it has a lot of attitude in it which can be a negative thing in rap influenced films, but it's just a total p**s take and isn't a problem because of the irony it creates.<br /><br />plenty of stand-out bits, one of those types of films which you will find yourself quoting lines with your mates, and it will raise laughter.<br /><br />my personal favourite part is the 'guerrillas in the midst' section. great video, superb!
