for a danish movie, i have to say, that this is very good movie.<br /><br />it's in a class of its own, yet it has an international potential.<br /><br />the movie has a big budget, and is starring famous danish actors, and a few newcomers, who play very well. it can be watched by anyone who like adventures, and a little bit of 'ghost' movie.<br /><br />don't be afraid, be thrilled!
