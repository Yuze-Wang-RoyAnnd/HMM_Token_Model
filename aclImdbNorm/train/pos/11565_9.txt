spoilers<br /><br />in the words of jean-paul sartre, "hell is other people". in "the odd couple", jack lemmon and walter matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be. as felix ungar and oscar madison, lemmon and matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together. as the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other, the laughs come thick and fast, before felix departs, leaving oscar a changed and more cleanly individual.<br /><br />jack lemmon as ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic, cleaning obsessed divorcee coping with life as a single man. walter matthau in contrast to lemmon's character is equally as good as the slobbish sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefits.<br /><br />lemmon and matthau are magnificant in their selected parts, to some degree dependent upon the beautiful script by neil simon, and simultaneously because they work well as a team. as two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles, although similar in relationships with ex-wives and children, these two, late, great actors create a partnership which is practically impossible to recreate. so great in fact, that the world screamed out so much for something similar, that two years before matthau's death and three before lemmon's, the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel. this idea, whilst following hollywood's irritating obsession with sequels, might have worked to a certain degree, but at the same time, it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original film.<br /><br />ultimately it's not really possible to say anything else. with simon's amazing script, filled with humour and laughter, the creators of this film were already onto a hit. the casting of jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix ungar and oscar madison though, is the most important part of this film. "the odd couple", with it's traditional soundtrack (which even gained a tribute in "the simpsons"), it's excellent script and it's genius leading men, is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember.
