dani(reese witherspoon) has always been very close with her older sister maureen(emily warfield) until they both start falling in love with their neighbor court(jason london). but it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade away.<br /><br />this was truly a heartbreaking story about first love. probably the most painful story about young love that i have ever seen. all the acting is amazing and reese witherspoon gives a great performance in her first movie. i would give the man in the moon 8.5/10
