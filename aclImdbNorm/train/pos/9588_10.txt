when paris is burning came out, i totally dismissed it. i was not into the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon. i thought it was going to be campy and silly. how wrong i was about this movie. i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it. it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally. the 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture. what a terrific job! i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them. if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know. <br /><br />i hope they make another documentary. i loved it
