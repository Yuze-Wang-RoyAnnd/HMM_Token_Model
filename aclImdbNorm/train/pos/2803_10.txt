as a former 2 time okinawan karate world champion, i like movies about sacrifice for sport. but this movie is about so much more. this movie is so good and so deep. i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion. almost lights out for me. and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about. this is a movie about living. living your life for yourself and respect for others. empowerment. god, bless "bend it like beckham" i believe it is a true gem.
