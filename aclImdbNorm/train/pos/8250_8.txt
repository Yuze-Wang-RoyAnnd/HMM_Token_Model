this film takes place in the 1950s. according to this the dead (called zombies) have arisen to eat the living. however a company has developed a collar that, when put around the zombies neck, makes them docile and perfect servants. the robinsons mom helen (carrie-anne moss), dad bill (dylan baker) and son timmy (k'sun ray) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one. tim names the zombie fido (billy connolly) and becomes friends with him. but his dad hates him and timmy looses control of fido and things go wrong.<br /><br />as you can see this is--among many other things--a takeoff on the "lassie" series with fido being a stand in for lassie. timmy was named that for a reason! every single of the famous lassie episodes are spun here. my favorite is when timmy sends fido off to get help before the zombies eat him! also it's a satire of those 1950s douglas sirk films where everything is bright and colorful--but dark secrets are tearing people apart. the characters wear very bright 1950s clothes (moss is always in a dress)--the furnishings, settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors. even when the script becomes repetitious there's always something to look at. the script is good--but there are only so many lassie jokes you can make. the melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off. everyone here is excellent and right on target. even connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job. moss is the best--playing each line for all its worth---but never going overboard.<br /><br />this isn't for everybody (of course). the satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame. the gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it's hard to take it seriously. so, for some people, this will really work. i give it an 8.
