for those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls, think again. there is a totally different side to the japanese animation. yakitate! japan is one of those shows. it is a sweet-natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread. his universe is all about creating a japanese bread that can match with the famous european breads. the show is as wacky as they come and i'm sure that non-japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes. but it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show. <br /><br />in the world of yakitate! it is not uncommon for people to look like they've just had an orgasm after eating bread. the bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers, from time-traveling to swimming like a fish. that weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows i've watched in a while.
