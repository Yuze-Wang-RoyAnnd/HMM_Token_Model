i won't repeat all that has been said already by other viewers of this film.<br /><br />in my opinion this is an excellent film, not only as a very human tale of the developing relationship between a father and his grown-up son, but also as a little window onto the world of practising islam, for those like me who are not very familiar with that religion.<br /><br />an important aspect of this story is that of the young man's relation to his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude towards the religion seems to alter in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with them.<br /><br />this is a very thought-provoking, enjoyable and well-made film that i would recommend to anyone with brain and heart.
