i just want to say that i am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie. bravo "the spaz", bravo! this movie is a ridiculous farce of film-making. especially for a student film! i just want to give credit to the spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture, and then to comment on it! most people i know don't have that kind of time, especially so few will end of reading it. kudos to you sir! anyway, the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly. i understand the idea behind creating a satire of charlie's angels but why hire such atrocious actresses! also, what kind of director has himself act, write, produce and also edit the picture! choose one job and put all your love into it man! it's such a shame because i hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. again, thanks to the spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film, people like you are a rare find.
