pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard. set in partition india, this film shows the true reality of partition india. urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go. her freedom, personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over a tragic land dispute. manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her remorseful abductor. there several moments in the film where one is brought to tears. the film at points is deeply traumatic. some of the partition scenes are spine chilling, yet urmila's endurance and survival are both remarkable. from a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. a remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling.
