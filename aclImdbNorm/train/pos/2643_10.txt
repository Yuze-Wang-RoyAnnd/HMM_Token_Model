i really can't say too much more about the plot of the movie that hasn't already been said. i haven't seen the movie in about 25 years and the memory of it has never left me. i have been searching for it every where. i have done net searches for it in the past but came up empty. last night i was thinking about the movie again and was trying to remember who was in it but i was only about 10 or 12 when i last saw it and i wasn't even sure if i had the right movie name so i decided to do another search and i finally found this sight. i was right. if any one knows where i can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family could you please let me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com i would really appreciate it. and to anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance to it is well worth it.
