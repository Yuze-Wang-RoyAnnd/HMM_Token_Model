one of the best comedians ever. i've seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more. my friends and family quote from this dvd so often, you'd think we did nothing other than watch it. the beginning part about alcatraz is a little bit slow, but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where eddie is on stage. watch for the "cake or death" part (joking about the church of england) and the "hitler/pol pot" part (hard to explain, just watch it). the best part of the show may be eddie's facial expressions. he can really say a lot with his eyes. (mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow probably help, huh?) fair warning: eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four-letter words in.
