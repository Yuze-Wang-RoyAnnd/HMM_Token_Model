probably the two main significances of "elmer's pet rabbit" are that the wacky leporid featured in "a wild hare" now has a name, and that he utters his famous "of course you realize this means war!" for the first time. mostly, the termite terrace crowd was still trying to figure out what exactly to do with this long-eared rascal. it's certainly a must-see for hard-core fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to take interest.<br /><br />but make no mistake, it's quite hilarious what bugs bunny does to the eternally gullible elmer fudd. clear shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon. i recommend it.
