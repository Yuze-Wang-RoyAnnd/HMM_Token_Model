"roman troy moronie" is my comment on the movie. what else is there to say?<br /><br />this character really brings out the moron in moronie. a tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently. <br /><br />roman moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons.<br /><br />there is of course great comedy among the other characters. michael keaton is f.a.h. and so is joe piscipo.<br /><br />i just like the fact that moronie kept the movie from an "r" rating because he could not pronounce profanity.
