<br /><br />have you ever felt like your being watched, like someone keeps tabs on every move you make? well, just remember before you decide to break the law, the fbi will always be there. at least that's the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama, the fbi story. it traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959), by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents, chip hardesty (james stewart).<br /><br />chip was with the fbi from day one, and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world, even occasionally his family. the fbi story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent, and how being one affects his personal life. the film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the fbi handles and how they handle them. the audience gets to see chip stop ku klux klan riots, go undercover to solve an indian murder/estate scandal, bring fugitives into custody, rescue hostages, and helped fight in wwii. he even helped bring communist spies to justice.<br /><br />stewart, in a vaguely complex performance, is stellar (as always) as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much. one of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both chip's family life and his job. we witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son. we also observe his wife having a miscarriage, and his marriage having rocky times. almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job. vera miles gives a spotty performance, but it's very convincing, none the less. she was never a brilliant actress, but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her. well maybe that's just me? sadly, none of the other performances are worth mentioning, but the attention-grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested.<br /><br />the cinematography of this film was impressive, especially the scenes in the south american jungles. the colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film. perhaps the greatest part of this movie was mervyn leroy's fabulous direction. every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story. it's chock full of ingenious camera shots, some with a very hitchcockian feel.<br /><br />all in all, the fbi story is a spectacular, but overlooked film. clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated, but if you get the chance i recommend jumping into this one. i enjoyed jimmy stewart's spectacular performance, and the captivating story.
