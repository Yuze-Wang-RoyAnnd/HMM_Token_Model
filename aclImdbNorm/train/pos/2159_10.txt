first, there is no way the remake can be as good, because japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such a major part in this film, as explained in the opening narration. it adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie. there is slew of different supporting characters/personalities. each does there part in making this movie wonderful. this movie is full of comedy that isn't vulgar in anyway like most of today's "gross-out comedies." yet it can still have you laughing out loud. the reality is, in real life, you don't have a choice of who you work with or go to school with...etc. this movie truly emphasizes that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences. not to mention, it makes for a great sub-plot and much of the humor. this is a story about dance that actually has a story, and a good one at that. there are a few back stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main storyline. truly a well written film. the dancing is great, too. i happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort, for that aspect. however, this movie goes beyond any other with dance, in the fact that, it is a story first and just happens to be written about dancing in japanse society. highly recommended.<br /><br />10 out of 10.
