just as the new bsg wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting, caprica may not deliver what fans of the new bsg were expecting (for the most part). it is a very interesting, if not somewhat self-involved show, or at least the pilot is.<br /><br />if you're looking for the big cgi thrills of the (new) bsg, you'll be sorely disappointed. if you liked the drama, you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with.<br /><br />the storyline does examine on how the cylons were developed, why adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society. the writers also manage to tackle humans 'playing god(s)' and the creation or re-creation of 'human' life. it will be interesting to see how this plays out.<br /><br />i found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others, but all in all it was promising. a small part of me wishes (or hopes) there might be some minor inklings of bsg in there (aside from the back story i mentioned), but that would probably convolute the storyline too much. like bsg, i'll have to wait and see if caprica grows on me, but it's way too early to tell.<br /><br />it would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series, but i'm willing to give it a chance. overall, i thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing in the (proverbial) towel'.
