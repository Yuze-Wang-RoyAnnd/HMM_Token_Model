skippy from family ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie. the film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves - except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave (using skippy to help out). and while the plot is corny and cliche, the corniness (for example, an evil green fog taking off a girl's clothes)and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious (and great). and of course, there's nothing like ozzy osbourne playing a preacher who's asking what happened to the love song :). definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh. and while you're at it, make it a double feature with slumber party massacre 2 - there's an "evil rocker" (as stated on the video box)driller killer in black leather w/fringe. a must see for cheesy movie fans.
