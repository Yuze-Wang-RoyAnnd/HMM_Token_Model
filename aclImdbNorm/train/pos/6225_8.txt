this was the second of three films that irving berlin wrote for the astaire-rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by harriet hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and/or shared between the principals. as usual the storyline needn't detain us though for the record it was based on a play, shore leave, that also served as the basis for a broadway musical, hit the deck. anyone who actually saw shore leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by fred and ginger were created for the movie but what matters, as always, is the music, lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle. it's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1) we get to see astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs, one of which, i'm building up to an awful let-down, had a lyric by johnny mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman, albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner ginger before the story starts. he gets to perform a little-known but excellent berlin number, i'd rather lead a band as well as duetting on i'm putting all my eggs in one basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of world war ii were already being felt - let's face the music and dance, one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team. so what if randolph scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and harriet hilliard doesn't exactly set the screen on fire; we came to see fred and ginger and the only question is, do they deliver. answer: in spades.
