i saw this film when it was originally released in 1989. i enjoyed it then, and i still do now. but what i realize now is that this is quite "adult" for a film with a g rating, especially the notion of dying and going to heaven. burt reynolds and dom deluise work wonderfully together, and reynolds' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog. there are some good songs ranging from upbeat ("let's make music together") to downright emotional ("home to my heart"). i found the plot good, although it does go off on a tangent once or twice. the final scene of the film with charlie and anne-marie is one of the saddest i've ever seen in animation. a film worth experiencing.
