this is one of those westerns that, well, stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog. very few can hold up to it over the long haul. that said, the rest is pretty bad. nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of the wild bunch, junior bonner, and perhaps a few more. <br /><br />it is riddled with weaknesses, john drew barrimore the most glaring. however it does have one truly memorable scene. nothing like it. its right after kid wichita kills the sheriff, and goes to jack elams place trying to goad him into a fight. wonderful stuff. right up with the best in any western.
