this was the third muppet movie and the last one jim henson was around to take part in the making of before his premature death in 1990. the first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before i was born. i originally saw the first and second installments in the original trilogy, "the muppet movie" and "the great muppet caper", around the mid-nineties, as a kid, but didn't see this third one, "the muppets take manhattan", until april 2007. this was shortly after i had seen its two predecessors and 1996's "muppet treasure island" for the first time in many years. this third muppet movie definitely didn't disappoint me the first time i saw it, and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much, but if not, it certainly didn't go too far downhill.<br /><br />the muppets' stage musical, "manhattan melodies", turns out to be a big hit on their college campus. they are graduating from college, so they will soon be leaving, but decide they will all stay together and go to manhattan to try and get their show on broadway. after their arrival, they begin searching for a producer, but after many rejections, they finally decide to part and go find jobs. most of them leave town, but kermit stays, and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the muppet gang. he gets a job at a new york restaurant owned by a man named pete. the frog quickly befriends pete's daughter, jenny, an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father's restaurant as a waitress. as kermit continues his attempts to reach stardom, now with the help of jenny, he doesn't know that miss piggy has secretly stayed in new york and is now spying on him. she begins to see kermit and jenny together, and to her it looks like they're getting close, which leads to jealousy! <br /><br />when i saw this movie for the second time, it looked disappointing at first. it seemed a little rushed, unfocused, and maybe even forgettable around the beginning. there are some funny bits during this part of the film, such as animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus, but for a little while, the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors. fortunately, it wasn't long before that changed. the film is entertaining for the most part, with "saying goodbye", the poignant song the muppets sing as they part, and a lot that happens after that. the two funniest parts might be miss piggy's tantrums after she sees kermit and jenny hugging, but there were definitely many other times when i laughed, such as poor fozzie trying to hibernate with other bears. the muppets still have their charm and comical antics, which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part, as does the plot, a simple but intriguing one for all ages. there are some weaker moments, such as the muppet babies sequence, and juliana donald's performance as jenny is lacklustre, but neither of these problems are too significant, and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience.<br /><br />i would say "the muppet movie", the film that started the franchise in 1979, is the best of the original trilogy, and that seems to be the most popular opinion. this third film is probably the weakest of the three, but all of them are good. unlike "muppets from space", the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after henson's sad passing, at least "the muppets take manhattan" is still the muppets! i won't go into details about what i think of the muppets' 1999 film, released twenty years after their first one, since i've already explained in my review of it why i found it so disappointing, and even though it does have some appeal, i'm clearly not alone. however, every theatrical movie starring the lovable muppets that was made during henson's life is good entertainment for the whole family, even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly preceded it.
