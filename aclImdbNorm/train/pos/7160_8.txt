a disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort. "holes" doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. for the first time events are not explained in details. the flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. i must admit that at first i was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie. but soon i realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities. (one example where caveman is forbidden to teach zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character,like learning to read won't contribute to that). "holes" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. a must watch!
