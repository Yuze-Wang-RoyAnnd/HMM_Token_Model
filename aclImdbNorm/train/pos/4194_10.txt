samuel fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy, pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema.<br /><br />richard widmark plays a petty thief tough guy (a role he perfected over the course of many movies), who snatches a young lady's (jean peters) wallet on a new york subway and with it a piece of much-wanted microfilm. this is 1953, so of course the microfilm is property of commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back. when the girl shows up at widmark's waterfront shack, sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film, widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her "comrades" down for big money. the plot thickens, people start dying, and widmark and peters fall in love.<br /><br />fuller handles the love story clumsily, but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction. it's as if he included a love story under duress, and so made it intentionally unbelievable, as love stories so frequently were and still are in hollywood films. peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough new yawk cookie, part gangster moll and part damsel in distress. when violence occurs against her, we genuinely care about her well being, and it's typical of fuller's renegade, ahead-of-his-time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion.<br /><br />but the ultimate success of "pickup on south street" rests squarely on the world-weary shoulders of thelma ritter, who plays moe, a feisty lady who makes money any way she can, whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant. ritter gives the performance of her career; in a breathtaking monologue, she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character's life, and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle, crime and hardship. it's as if every character ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies. the scene is the highlight of fuller's film, and a highlight of 50s cinema, period.<br /><br />grade: a+
