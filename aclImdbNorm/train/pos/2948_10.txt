it should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with eddie murphy. i have never seen anything like it.<br /><br />murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes about dicks, pussy, tits and insaults so many famous people including his own "family". among the people who gets it by murphy are: elvis, mr.t, michael jackson, stevie wonder, mick jagger, luther vandross and james brown. i have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life. i mean, when a person doesn't know who mr. t is, but still laughs so hard of murphy as mr. t, there's something about it. at the time i saw the show i couldn't remember who mr t. was but still laughed. now i know who he is and that just makes it so much more funny. because that's what eddie do - he can make those impressions so good that it don't matter who the hell he's trying to do, it's still hilarious. and on top of that, we learn that murphy actually is a very good singer. please watch it..
