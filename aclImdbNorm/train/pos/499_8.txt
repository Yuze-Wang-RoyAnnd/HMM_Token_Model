the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek: a dose of realistic, flawed personalities. the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring, they were so noble as to be unbelievable. i also like the sub-plot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans. its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs. it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two, though i don't think it would work in the time frame of the show. the only negatives that jumped out at me were the "quick cut off the ending at 2 hours" feel of the end, which is common among many of the trek shows. the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes. it was out of place, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin. but its not my job to make the show profitable, so oh well.<br /><br />lets see how the next episode does.
