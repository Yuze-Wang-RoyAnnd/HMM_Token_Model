well, there is a plenty of ways how to spoil a political thriller. usually they are derivative or too ambitious, often they feature a conspiracy that is totally paranoic and unbelievable. but city hall does not do neither of the above mentioned. the plot is cleverly crafted, story is believable. as far as characters go i would say this movie is a solid average. no character seems out of place and al pacino is brilliant as always. his portrayal of a charismatic nyc mayor is superb and proves again that al pacino belongs to the absolute top of american actors nowadays.
