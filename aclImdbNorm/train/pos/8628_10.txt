"der todesking"-jorg buttgereit's second full-length feature film(the first one was notorious "nekromantik")has no central character or characters,but instead thematic continuity in the act of suicide.divided into days of the week,it comprises of a series of set-pieces,each of which featuring the self-destruction of a complete stranger.yes,the production values are low and it's disturbing,but in many ways "der todesking" is extremely effective.it makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment.unlike the other buttgereit's works it isn't very gory,but there are some unpleasant images like castration scene in the tuesday episode,a decomposing corpse and various acts of suicide.the last(sunday)episode is so depressing and full of pain!-just amazing if you want my opinion.10 out of 10-check out this post-modernism shocker!disturbing art in the purest form!
