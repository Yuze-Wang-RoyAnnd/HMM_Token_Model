ok, so it borrows a little from "it's a wonderful life", but that was 44 years prior to this film, so why not a new attempt. belushi is having a rotten 35th birthday. he didn't get his wheaties, his coffee, and has lost his job. the capper is when his self described "big blue piece of sh**" car breaks down at the end of the day. he heads into an empty bar to call for a tow. while waiting, he's recognized by the bartender (caine) as the kid who lost the town's championship baseball game 20 years earlier. this gets him to thinking how life would've been if he had won the game. he finds out when, unbeknownst to him, caine serves up a motion potion in a glass that gives him a mansion, the prom queen (russo) as his wife, and makes him president of the sporting goods company he's been canned from. caine later reveals himself as the one who's responsible for this change, but belushi is not entirely on board. he never fully adjusts, and in a plot development that doesn't kill the movie but is still odd, he tries to court his wife (hamilton) from his real life, who is now married to someone else. the good move is that they don't spend too much time on it, as basically they rip of "ghost", with belushi constantly telling hamilton things only she could know. it also brings in a hokey dramatic element, as two of his lovers kevetch in the shadows, new wife russo, and his unbalanced lover cox. but the keys to the film are the somewhat lengthy beginning, and cheery end. also good work from the big and recognizable cast, as belushi is very likable, very attractive ladies chosen, and caine is perfectly easy going as the title guy. strange that this was belushi's second film of 1990 dealing with him getting an alternative lifestyle of riches, which was found in "taking care of business". though similar, both films are on the same level of laughs provided. so check this out for a fun exploration of "what if?"
