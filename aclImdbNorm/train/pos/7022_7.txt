finally!!!!!!!!!!! i've been waiting for this film to come out for almost a year, and finally saw it at the premiere in sb. i met a few of the actors, who were really nice and who were great in the movie. i watched the trailer so many times that i didn't know what to expect but got totally sucked in. the film was really beautiful to look at it and the music was good too. i recommend it to anyone who's a ryan donowho fan, and dominique swain was good in it too. the other actors were good also great. i hope it comes out on dvd soon!!!!!<br /><br />i first got into ryan from watching the oc and then saw him in a bunch of good indies like imaginary heroes. he is great in this film, and everything that he does that's indie. i also like dominique but haven't seen her in as much. hope to see them both in more soon!!!
