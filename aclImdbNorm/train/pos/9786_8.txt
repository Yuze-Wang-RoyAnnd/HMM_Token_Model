i really enjoyed the performances of the main cast. emma lung is courageous and interesting. the director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional. a complex story with the changing between eras. also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town. i do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive. there have be many relationships with older men and younger women - without the male being good looking. depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow. the film has a good look and the cinematography is also good.
