not the most successful television project john cleese ever did, "strange case" has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made. there are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones, but the story as a whole unfortunately doesn't add up to much.<br /><br />arthur lowe is a hoot, though, as dr. watson, bionic bits and all. "good lord."
