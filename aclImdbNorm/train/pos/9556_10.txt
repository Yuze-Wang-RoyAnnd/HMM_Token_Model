when our local tv station first launched, it filled a lot of its schedule with old british programming. "lock up your daughters!" was duly aired, and i -- swayed by the opening few seconds of the film -- popped in a blank tape. best thing i ever did.<br /><br />the actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life, complete with appropriate accents (christopher plummer's foppington will leave you in stitches, as will hoyden and her family). double entendres abound, plot-line wheels within wheels mix and match the characters, hilarious sight gags lurk in every scene, and risqu'e comments are made on a regular basis.<br /><br />i showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece "a lost treasure," as much for the cast as for the story. to this day i can crack up just thinking about the dialog. should this gem ever find its way to a dvd release, i'll be at the front of the line.
