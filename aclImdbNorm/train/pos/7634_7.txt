<br /><br />ok the film wasn't going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum, and it is a modern update on "it's a wonderful life". but it's just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing $13. you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list celebs. however it's an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don't think too much in it.
