two movies back to back which dealt with indian pows; veer zaara and deewaar. although veer zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone, deewaar focuses on the main subject itself. it is not hidden that many indian pows are rotting in pakistani jails for years - for whom neither indian govt. has time or sympathy nor the other side. i'm sure some of pakistani pows are in india as well, but let's focus on the movie. full of actors. some were stage actors like raghubir yadav, rajendra gupta, etc. amitabh bachchan who plays the role of a major, acted well. akshaye khanna did his part well. there was nothing for amrita rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs. i think sanjay dutt's role was most solid even though it wasn't too long. he acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive. if you compare it to loc, which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions (if it had a story) - deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors. 7.5/10
