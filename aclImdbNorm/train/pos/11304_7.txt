i'm not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cain's novel "the postman always rings twice" (i'm not even sure if viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely interesting. it is not the best version of cain's story (i like the 1981 version best), but thanks to visconti's excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans. visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. the film is not perfect, though. my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (i don't think visconti was very good at editing his films). i think film noir works better with a short running time. fortunately, calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. anyhow, as much as i like this film and the remakes, i think no one has made the definitive version of cain's much-praised book.
