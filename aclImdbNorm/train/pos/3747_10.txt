i've never seen many online movies in most of my life, but if i'd pick any of them, i'd pick spatula madness, a clever reference to most movies like star trooper (etc.), using a camera, and wits of steel, jason steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting, and then putting it all together with frame-by-frame animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas. the story begins at the middle, hows that for directors delight? then the middle is at the beginning, and so on, when i first watched it, i expected a soggy pixely look, but jason, like me, loves looks, so took every detail to the max. although i don't recommend it for children, or would anybody besides me like it, but please search it up on the net (its a short film, look up film cow), its style reminds me of south park, but less violent. 10 for the look, 6 for the laughs, and 6 for the story, it all comes to a 10/10, good work<br /><br />jason steele, i'm anxious to see the movie.
