parsifal (1982) starring michael kutter, armin jordan, robert lloyd, martin sperr, edith clever, aage haugland and the voices of reiner goldberg, yvonne minton, wolfgang schone, director hans-jurgen syberberg.<br /><br />straight out of the german school of film, the kind that favored tons of symbolism and ingmar bergmanesque surrealism, came this 1982 film of wagner's final masterpiece- parsifal, written to correspond with good friday/easter and the consecration of the bayreuth opera house. this film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avant-garde and no other parsifal takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography. syberberg is known for controversial films. prior to this film he had released films about hitler and nazism, richard wagner and his personal anti-semitism and a documentary about winifred wagner, one of his grand-daughters. this film is possibly disturbing in many aspects. parsifal (sung by reiner goldberg but acted by michael kutter) is a male throughout the first part of the film and then, after the enchantment of kundry's kiss, is transformed into a female. this gender-bending element displays the feminine/masculine/ying-yang nature of the quest for the holy grail, which serves all mankind and redeems it through christ's blood. in the pagan sorcerer klingsor's fortress, there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as hitler, nietzche, cosima wagner and wagner's mistress matilde wesendock. the swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress. parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film. the tempting flower maidens are in the nude. kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt mary magdalene or eve from genesis (played by edith clever but beautifully sung by mezzo-soprano yvonne minton). ultimately, this film is for fans of this type of bizarre germanic/european symbolic metafiction and for intellectuals who appreciate the symbolism, the history and lovers of wagner opera. indeed, the singing is grand and compelling. reiner goldberg's parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater parsifals of the stage - james king, wolfgang windgassen, rene kollo and today's own placido domingo. yvone minton is a sensual-voiced, dramatic and exciting kundry, delving into her tormented state perfectly. while the production is certainly unorthodox and as un-wagnerian as it can possibly get (wagner's concept was christian ceremonial pomp with grails, spears, castles, knights and wounded kings, a dark sorcerer, darkness turning into light, etc typical wagnerian themes)..it is still an enjoyable, art-house film.
