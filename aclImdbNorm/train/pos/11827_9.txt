if dick tracy was in black and white, the pope wouldn't be religious. giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie, we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic-strip world, and it's one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so, thanks to a serious script, good direction, great performances (al pacino is astonishing) and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography, art direction and costume design. using only primary colors, the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before. and there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangster-movie genre, pratically extinct from modern cinema. overall, i see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and already-seen formulas. 7 out of 10.
