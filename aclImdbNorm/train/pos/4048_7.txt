rohmer strays from his usual portraits of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution. what's more attractive about "la anglaise..." (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetics that rohmer has achieved. the images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures. in some moments you can't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in louvre musseum. every shot is like a piece of art.<br /><br />*my rate: 7.5/10<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />-------------- -<br /><br />------------<br /><br />-------------------
