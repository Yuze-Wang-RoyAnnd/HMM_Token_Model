if only eddie murphy were born 10 years later. then we'd all remember it. but even i was only 4 when it came out. if you haven't seen it yet, rent dr. dolittle, showtime, i spy, pluto nash and all eddie's family comedy movies - then watch this. hands down, you'll laugh 90% of the time. the other 10% you'll be wiping the tears from your eyes.<br /><br />it really needs to be watched more then once to understand all the jokes. from crude humor to a joke for kids!(if you've seen it you'll laugh here) - you'll love his stuff. if you can, (or are a big fan) try to download clips from eddie's acts. allot of the shows are different as you'd imagine and he has even more funny jokes.<br /><br />but this is like the "best of" eddie murphy 'x-rated' if you will.<br /><br />and all i can say is please don't watch delirious if you don't like comedy, don't have a sense of humor or are not fun to hang out with. you will only put down this great eddie murphy classic and possibly make someone miss out on it.<br /><br />if you wanna know how eddie got beverly hills cop and got famous from it- delirious is it.
