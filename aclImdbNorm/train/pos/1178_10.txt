this might be the wwe's 2nd best ppv of the year after wrestlemania it was a good suprise! john cena had an excellent match in which he upset chris jericho. jeff hardy retained his ic title in a short sloppy match with willam regal. bubba & spike dudley won a fairly violent tables match over benoit & guerrero. jamie noble had a really good match with kidman which was suprising to me. booker t defeated the big show in a no dq match, at one point booker t gave the scissors kick to big show and sent him right through the table. in a stupid decision by the wwe christian and lance storm, the jealous anti-americans defeated hogan and edge with a lot of help from test and jericho. rvd and brock had the match of the night it was filled with great high spots and rvd got to retain his ic title through a dq so i was happy he kept the title. triple h also signed with eric bischoff and raw which means little to nothing. and in the main event the rock became the first ever 7-time wwe world champion defeating both kurt angle & undertaker in a triple threat match. overall this is probably the wwe's 2nd best ppv of 2002! 7/10
