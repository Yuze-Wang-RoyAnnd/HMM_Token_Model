this installment very much makes the cia look like a very foolish organization. in reality, perhaps they are. after all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill jason bourne.<br /><br />matt damon does a very credible job as bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. he is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. he gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film, somebody is trying to kill him.<br /><br />there is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. there are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less hollywood than many pictures. these sequences add realism to the film in feeling.<br /><br />the suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if bourne can head them off. this is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & i am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series.
