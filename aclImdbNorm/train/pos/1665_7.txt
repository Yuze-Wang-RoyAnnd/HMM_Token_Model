the movie looked like a walk-through for "immoral study". most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about "now, who drew this penis?!" sounded a bit gratuitous. dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful, albeit visually this movie got its moments. i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises. highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while.
