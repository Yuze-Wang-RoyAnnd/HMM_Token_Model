i am glad i saw this film having seen some of the director's other films in the past. i thought the production values was great like the costumes and settings with the bridge. it was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were handled.<br /><br />i do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes. they were hard to follow at times.<br /><br />ultimately, a moral tale. it would be interesting to know what some japanese viewers thought of the film. it is a film i would like to see again.<br /><br />some scenes like the ones where benkai and the prince were fighting on a "psychic" level were well done.<br /><br />i did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here. intense.
