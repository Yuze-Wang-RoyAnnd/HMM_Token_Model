as a guy who has seen all the seasons, i can say that jg constantly surprises me. i mean, after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster, u thought to yourself: ok he is a good actor and he can get into a gangster's skin. but after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life, i mean i could almost feel the pain he "made" us believe he was going through. i was so touched by his performance that i immediately thought at robert de niro, marlon brando and al pacino. these guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more. but nowadays they are either old or dead (brando) and it's ok that they make less movies and their performances are "lighter" than they used to be. i can't wait to see gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role. can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance?
