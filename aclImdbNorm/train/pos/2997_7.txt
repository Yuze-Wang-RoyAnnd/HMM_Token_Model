william powell is philo vance in "the kennel murder case," a 1933 film also starring mary astor, paul cavanagh, eugene palette, helen vinson and ralph morgan. a dog show in which philo has entered his scottish terrier captain serves as the background for a locked room mystery with too many suspects. the mystery is very clever and the denouement both complicated and interesting. since the talkies are still quite young, the camera work is a little static, but michael curtiz does a good job directing the action.<br /><br />the supporting cast is excellent; the entire cast brings the film up a notch. lots of actors have played philo vance, including paul lukas, basil rathbone, wilford hyde-white, edmund lowe, james stephenson, alan curtis, warren william and others. powell played it the most (five times) and is the best fit for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. this was made before "the thin man" catapulted him to big stardom - he had spent about 12 years in film by then, beginning his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20. a remarkable man, a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable actor who lived to be nearly 92. we're so lucky to have his films available on dvd and on tcm today. "the kennel murder case" is a great story and a fun film - don't miss it.
