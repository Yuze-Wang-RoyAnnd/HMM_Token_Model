let's get some things straight first: zombies don't exist so the filmmaker can have them walk, run, hell even fly if he wants to. that's what makes this original zombie movie so good. everything they did was so damn original. i hate it when filmmakers do everything like romero or when fan boys expect everything like romero. some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical romero movie, once again zombies don't exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants. the zombies in this movie all look very good but obviously they are not decaying corpses since they just freaking died! they are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood. one of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat. it looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it. this movie got really good reviews in fangoria and rue morgue so that made me want to go see it. i'm glad i listened. they are always right when it comes to real horror fan's tastes. 10 out of 10! go rent it!
