this is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village, that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old kurosawa's works, combined with dostoyevski's topics of human psychology (o-shin - sonia marmeladova ), shakespeare's drama and hans christian andersen's tragic and cheerfulness. the screenplay is wondrous, the scenes are colour- and beautiful some scenes stay really imprinted in my mind. the plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a little action, so if you don't like all the sentiments you'd also come to your costs - . it is not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai with their bushido pouring all out of them, but about life, work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time. a lovely and fascinating tribute to kurosawa, certainly worth seeing.
