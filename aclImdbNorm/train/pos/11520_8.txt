the quintessential road movie...if your idea of a road movie involves three would-be magicians with eastern european accents and claire forlani. (well, one out of four ain't bad...) a no-talent magician with an eye for showmanship (max) watches a very skilled pickpocket (hugo) plying his trade in new york. after convincing hugo that he (max) is a) mental and b) desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive, the not-so-dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions (milo) and the, ah, gentler attributes of a lovely waitress (lydia). the unlikely four pile into a van (obtained by hugo...you guess where it came from) and head to vegas. havoc ensues. anyhow, it's funny, it's well-written, and the ending is surprisingly good. a solid comedy with a warm heart, and all the better that it was totally unexpected.
