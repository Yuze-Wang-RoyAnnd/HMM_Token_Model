this musical is decidedly mixed, and none of the elements really fit together, but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable. the plot contains some of the elements of wodehouse's novel, but none of its virtues, though he co-wrote the script. the songs, though charming, have nothing to do with this particular film, and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot, even by pre-oklahoma standards. burns and allen do their usual shtick quite competently, but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty iq points.<br /><br />there are a few high points. reginald gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie, and stops mugging like a silent actor. and there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by wodehouse, though most of the film feels like the production of one of the hollywood meetings he later parodied.
