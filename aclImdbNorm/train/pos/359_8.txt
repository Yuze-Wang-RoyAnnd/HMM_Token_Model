i can't believe i am just now seeing this film -- i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated, and i avoided roots for the same reason -- just as i have yet to see schindler's list -- i don't want to be "entertained" by other peoples' pain, not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be.<br /><br />so i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites. the black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters -- or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their "husbands". it was painful to watch, but everyone redeemed himself in the end, and the acting was phenomenal! i couldn't believe the character oprah played at the age of 35! and i adore whoopi to start with - she was amazing. i'm so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple.
