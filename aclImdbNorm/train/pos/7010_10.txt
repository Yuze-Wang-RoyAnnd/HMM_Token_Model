before i see on this film, i see a lot of comments, which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad...<br /><br />what i really want to point out is the acting on woody harrelson behalf, he may not be in many parts of the film, but when he appears or even the intro, i was astonished by will smith's and woody harrelson "message" they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on.<br /><br />i am not a very sentimental person, i believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it. but a act to show redemption, there is not many films that in my point of view can show this. this is one of them that can.<br /><br />i agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of "suicide" is a downfall, however i do not believe that is the "message" the film is trying to send, but "sacrifice". a bit to the extreme, but that is the message in my opinion.<br /><br />this film has potential. the acting it is worth every penny, the script is unbelievable. from a person that doesn't really like watching drama films... if you like drama this is a must go watch.
