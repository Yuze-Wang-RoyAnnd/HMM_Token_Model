it's all about mitzi. i loved her in this. and didn't she look fantastic?! i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies. this is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times. the richard character was completely creepy. i've dated guys like that. well, not totally like that lol. i wish zack hadn't have gotten killed. he was a cutie and very easy on the eyes. i love these stalker type stories. it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked. my husband doesn't usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it. i can't wait to see what mitzi does next!
