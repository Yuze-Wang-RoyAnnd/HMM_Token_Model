a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story. so, there is more. there is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.<br /><br />this film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely. it's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film. the added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension setting.<br /><br />i have no idea of the strength of the chess players as i don't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable. all in all, most of the film goes down very easily. it is also forgotten again very easily though. so it's nice to watch but nothing more than that.<br /><br />7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place
