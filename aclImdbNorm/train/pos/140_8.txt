normally i don't like series at all. they're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast.<br /><br />these series however, are well played, the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still be catching your mind.<br /><br />the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital.
