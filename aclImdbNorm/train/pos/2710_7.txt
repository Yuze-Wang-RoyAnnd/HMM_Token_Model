this is not my favorite wip ("women in prison"), but it is one of the most famous films in the sub-genre. it is was produced by roger corman, who at this point had already produced a few wips. it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. the movie takes place in an usa prison, not in a "banana republic" like most wip films. i'm not sure if that was a wise move, but it is an acceptable change of pace. writer-director demme really gets into his job, always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario. in fact, he is a little too ambitious for his own good. the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks-in-chains flick. but do not worry, demme still operates within the parameters of the sub-genre. there is plenty of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy hardcore fans. the film is a little slow, but it is very entertaining. the cast is good. roberta collins is a wip veteran, so she does not need an introduction, and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair-bound crazy warden. pam grier is sorely missed, though.
