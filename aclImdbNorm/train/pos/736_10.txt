a must for any punk rocker, this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early 1980's (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies, with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show. originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars, but the release of the "live at budakon" album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie. very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market (which sadly never happened until after the bands demise). the band, dee dee especially, always disliked the movie through the 80's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows. this movie, like most classics, is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday. don't expect more, you won't find it. it's great fun, so enjoy it. another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy, featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear.
