where the sidewalk ends deserves to be a better known film directed by otto preminger, the man who gave the world laura. and this time, he's got the same co-stars: dana andrews and gene tierney. it must be said that tierney here is under-used in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to andrews.<br /><br />he plays a tough, hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him. when suspicion falls on a cab driver (tom tully), he goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because he's in love with the cabbie's daughter (gene tierney). tierney, by the way, looks a little too elegant for the girl she's playing here and doesn't seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the story.<br /><br />the story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero. by the end, it turns into a morality tale with andrews developing a conscience over his crime.<br /><br />it's fascinating as film noir with capable performances from a strong supporting cast. a good entry in the field of noir, forcefully directed by preminger and nicely played by andrews and tierney, despite the slight miscasting of her character.
