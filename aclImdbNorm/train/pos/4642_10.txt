the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point. it's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time, or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well-meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace. if only it was that easy. but the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better, as the situation gets worse and worse every single day. well, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.<br /><br />the central theme is that revenge begets more revenge, which begets even more, in an ever-expanding bloodbath. both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side, which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation. where does it end? and apparently he missed the significance of "the bubble" referred to in the name, which was that people living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them, which is partly why they seemed so naive. (he also seemed to think that ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem, which tells me he wasn't paying attention when ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered.) <br /><br />i found it very brave of the director, the screenplay writer, and both star-crossed lovers, to update the romeo & juliet story to a modern troubled land, and to make both lovers male. let's be honest here: very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female (young love wins all hearts) -- but when people's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that, incredibly, these same people would rather have them hate each other, then the conclusion is inevitable.
