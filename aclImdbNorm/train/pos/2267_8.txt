i have not read the novel, or anything other by kurt vonnegut, but i am now intending to start. this grips you from the very first frame, and does not let go until the end credits start rolling. taking you places you don't expect, the plot is interesting throughout. the pacing is spot-on, nothing lasts too long, and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we've seen. it is well-told and well-thought out. i've never watched a film that i feel i could particularly compare this to. it is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. the acting is excellent, nolte absolutely shines, goodman again proves that he doesn't have to go for laughs, and lee and arkin are spellbinding. i could go on, really... no role is treated to a less than stellar performance. the editing and cinematography are marvelous, and all of the visuals are great, with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones. i am going to go for other movies directed by keith gordon, as well as the other two apparently related to this, through the author of the books. there is one scene of sexuality, and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this. i recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; it is not pleasant. 8/10
