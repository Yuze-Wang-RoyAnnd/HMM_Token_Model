okay. this has been a favourite since i was 14. granted, i don't watch it multiple times a year anymore, but... this is not a movie for an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message. this movie is fun. it's pretty dated, almost passe, but parker posey is so brilliant that it's unbelievable. if you want to be charmed by a 90's breakfast at tiffany's, attended 90's raves, or love parker, this movie is for you. otherwise, don't bother.
