this is a film that everyone should watch. quite apart from raising hugely important points (while south africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now), it is superbly directed while denzel washington gives, in my opinion, the best performance in his career so far. kline also gives a good performance, although perhaps not as stunning as washington's. john thaw also puts in a good turn as the chief of police.<br /><br />there are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down, but all of these have been avoided. it would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys, but attenborough has not done this. sure, there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil, such as the captain at the soweto uprising, but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long. some people complain about the length of the film as it is, but i think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story, for it really is an incredible one.<br /><br />the best scene in the film is that of steve biko's funeral. when the whole crowd begins to sing the south african national anthem, it is probably one of, if not the most moving scenes i have seen.<br /><br />if you haven't seen this film already: watch it. it may not be comfortable viewing, but it's certainly worth it.
