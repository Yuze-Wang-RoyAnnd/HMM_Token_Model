pecker is a hilariously funny yet twisted film about a small town in baltimore whose daily, humdrum routine is broken by pecker, a young photographer who takes pictures of "real things." no pretty models, no gorgeous men, just hard living. this wonderful film pokes fun at the plasticness of the urban art chain. there is one particular scene when a homeless woman who shops at pecker's mom's thrift shop buys the same exact coat as one of the whitney art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. this just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have, you might not always have taste. yet again john waters sends you into a never-ending spiral of laughter and raw reality. you can have your mainstream hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities, but give me a "pecker" or a "hairspray" (another excellent john waters film) over a "titanic" or a "godzilla" anyday!!
