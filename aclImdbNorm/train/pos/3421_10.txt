this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum. it is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither saddam hussein nor the people of iraq, god rest the souls of the 350,000 plus that have been killed, had anything to do with terrorism nor al-quida.<br /><br />following this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of "loose change." this movie is available free on the internet, until the bush cabal locks it down, by googling-up the very title, as indicated in parenthesis.<br /><br />god save our country. this will not be done by following the christo-fascists that controlled the halls of congress for over 10 years prior to november, 2006!
