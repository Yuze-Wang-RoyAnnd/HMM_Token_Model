"the groove tube" was initially shown on video, in the first "video theaters" here in boston. in one room, there were tv monitors on high stands, with old movie theater seats, in small groups facing the monitors. there were old refrigerators stocked with pepsi, and baskets of york peppermint patties. in a second, smaller room, there were no seats, just large pillows. that was the 'smoking' room, i.e., people got high in there. that act only added to the hilarity of the video.<br /><br />i was a 'frequent viewer'; the scenes i liked most and remember to this day are: koko the clown, the kramp family kitchen (kramp easy-lube shortening), safety sam/ vd psa, the chevy chase hitchhiker w/ nude runs through the woods, the finger ballet on what was eventually revealed to be the nude body of a woman. the last item was very reminiscent of the late, incredible ernie kovacs. now, i've lost a lot of readers that are under 48 ("who is ernie kovacs??") but trust me, it's funny stuff.<br /><br />one reason i was a 'frequent viewer' was that i, and my friends, would bring other "groove tube" virgins to see it. we would sit and slyly watch the faces of the 'virgins' as the "safety sam" psa would play. as the camera slowly zooms in on "sam", we would wait for that "oh!" of recognition on the 'virgin's' face. each time was more hilarious than the last. and then that 'virgin' would then bring a friend to see the show, repeating what we had done. to get this joke, you must watch the video.<br /><br />yes, some of it is dated, but most plays, film, television, and now videos are. just look at any video made in the 1980's.<br /><br />i did see "the groove tube" in a theater as a film, a grainy transfer from the original video. it had been cut, and was missing some of the original high-point scenes.<br /><br />the first "saturday night live" show, featuring chevy chase, elicited instant remarks of, "that's the guy from "the groove tube" ", so it was a precursor for chevy.<br /><br />i can't look at a can of shortening without hearing the voice-over, "coat your hands with a generous amount of kramp easy-lube shortening..." and thinking of the "kramp holiday loaf" recipe. always gets me laughing in the baking needs aisle in the grocery store.<br /><br />the early 70's were parlous times; "the groove tube" was fresh, new, and really 'got' the humor of the times. it offered a 'hip generation', humor that wasn't available in any other format/medium. mjh
