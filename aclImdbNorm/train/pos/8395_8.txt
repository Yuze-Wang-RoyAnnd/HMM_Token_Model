***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** this is without a doubt the best film rainer werner fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by hanna schygulla. film starts out with maria (schygulla) and hermann braun (klaus lowitsch) just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive. maria decides to get a job as a dancer/prostitute in a club that caters to american gi's and she meets a black army soldier named bill (greg eagles) and they start to see one another on a steady basis. maria hears that her husband hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with bill. but one day while getting intimate with bill they see hermann at the door. he hasn't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and maria breaks a bottle over bill's head and he dies. hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out. the war has ended and germany must rebuild and one day on a train maria meets karl oswald (ivan desny) who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job. maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes karl's mistress. she tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her. hermann gets out of jail but goes to canada to try and get over everything that maria has done since he has been locked up.<br /><br />*****spoiler alert*****<br /><br />one day karl dies and leaves maria just about everything in his will and maria buys her own house. then hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they're marriage even though they have been married for some time now. but maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it.<br /><br />there are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths. like in all fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way. as the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn germany but as maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white. the rebuilding of germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of maria. fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in germany at that time. hanna schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. with a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status. schygulla shows maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. she's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and fassbinder wanted to show maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. schygulla wasn't nominated for an academy award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time. fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother lilo pempeit plays frau ehmke. i have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether maria purposely left the gas on. later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad. this is only speculation and if you think i'm wrong please e-mail me. i think she was overly excited by hermann being home and left it on by accident (remember her putting on a dress for no reason?). then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that hermann and karl had become friendly without her knowledge and i think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing. thats the reason for the bathroom scene. so when the house explodes its by accident. but i think the reason for fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living. fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate. in his view maria can't have it both ways. a fascinating film.
