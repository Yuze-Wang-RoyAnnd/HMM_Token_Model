....rather well done, actually--attack the evil villains in their lair, stop a little big horn style ambush, save the day via the waterboys' bugling, works for me. stiff upper british lip and all that.<br /><br />so how does it play on a dvd 66 years later? struck me as being like a western, subbing apaches or sioux for the thugs, and the us cavalry for the imperial british army. it's very colonial in it's outlook, you know? white man's burden and all that? kipling certainly would have approved.<br /><br />cary grant, fairbanks and maclaglen play it as broadly as possible, putting some buddy buddy slapstick into the mix between the shootings and brawlings for good measure. (i had no idea it was joan fontaine as the token army wife--did they leave some of her scenes on the cutting room floor? very short-) none of them were aiming for an oscar here--in fact grant was not at his best in a few scenes--but sod it, it still works. and where else would ben casey wind up as an indian bugler? only in hollywood.<br /><br />def. check this out if you like adventure and pseudo-western style antics. it was done by a bunch of pros, well i might add.<br /><br />*** outta ****
