a stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman--so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense. an evil magician approaches him and informs him he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady's heart if he agrees to give him anything he wants that's within their room. the dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection out of the mirror--and bad things naturally occur as a result.<br /><br />if this film had been made just a decade later, i am sure i wouldn't have been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this film. after all, the film's plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is, at times, a bit stilted. however, when you consider that in 1913 "full-length" films were rare--and often only 20 to 30 minutes long! plus, the whole idea of a complex story like you get in this film is very unusual--as stories were very short and broadly acted. so, given the limitations of the time, this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films known.
