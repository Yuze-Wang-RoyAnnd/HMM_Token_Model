this film reinvents the term "spring breakumentary." hans, the fat one of the group, displays his talents as this generations chris farley. johnny kansas, "the king of the $1 bet," shows he's not in kansas anymore by consistently upping the stakes. kyle's laugh is truly infecting, and offers a little eye-candy for the ladies as well (as does matt). the dwarfs, while having their moments, did not do justice to the mexican hat dance like it deserves. and last, we have our protagonist, ed. he gives hope to all of us bumbling, stumbling, gangly, pale folk who are still searching for that special someone. and that hope, is a little place called cabo san lucas. while this blockbuster just missed the theaters, this is a must rent, as we can all relate to one of these spring breakumentarions.
