as is well-known among long haired youngsters who are incredibly interested in this herr graf's silent rants, during summertime aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and distinguished places in order to avoid the heat as well hordes of coarse people taking their ease. such bizarre travels around the world also happen in "three ages", a charming and elegant piece of silent work directed by old hands, namely herr buster keaton and herr eddie cline.<br /><br />obviously this german count liked most the first segment focused on the stone age due to the affinity that this aristocrat feels about that ancient time. preferring that to the second segment which takes place during the glory of rome (it should have included the cause of the fall of the roman empire, that is to say, barbarians, or the same thing, germans). of course, the third segment takes place during modern times but this teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago should qualify as modern.<br /><br />the leitmotiv that moves herr keaton and his companions to travel and endure the strange and hilarious happenings during three different ages, is the search for love, a very complicated subject to understand for aristocrats who prefer the search for money and self interest. every time that "three ages" is shown in the schloss theatre, it is always a pleasure to watch a funny, witty silent film (even for a serious german count), an oeuvre full of gags and gadgets, puns, pratfalls and acrobatics, visual and astounding technical tricks, an absolute silent delicatessen that is perfect to allow one to endure the various and coarse summertime severities.<br /><br />and now, if you'll allow me, i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must flirt with an old teutonic heiress who doesn't look her age.<br /><br />herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
