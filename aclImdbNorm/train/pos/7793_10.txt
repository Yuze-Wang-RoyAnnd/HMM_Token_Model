my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore. i think the title especially put me off. i can't ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over. i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store. it is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did. i was completely caught up in ruby's situation as she tries to make her way through her life. the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. i could have kept watching for hours. another downside is that i have been unsatisfied with everything ashley judd has done since. she is so perfect in this movie. this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time.
