it's a strange, yet somehow impressive story, about love. personnaly, i never run over such a twist-off story in real life. but, i can image there is.<br /><br />it's a story that promises to be "sick" from the title. but, after i watch it, i didn't get this feeling of "sickness" which i would surely have regarding society rules. it's something beautiful in this movie... something impressive...which i cannot contradict using any moral or society rules.<br /><br />the movie focuses mostly on relation between kiki and alex. you can see how this relation starts, evolves and finally ends. you feel the moment when this love blossoms, the first whispers, touchings. you feel the connection. and no moment i though this is immoral. you even hope it will not break in the end....it cannot break...it's not right. you feel the pain of being hart broken in the end...<br /><br />but,i need also to add a negative spin to this comment...i don't know if the story is not somehow *showed* to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form, but not in content. you don't have the total story, but only fragments. when movie has started, the relation between kiki and sandu was already in place. so, no clue about the nature of the relation. you feel only a tension between them...a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation. i think this line of kiki to sandu says all: "i want to stop...and if you love me, you will do as i ask you".<br /><br />this movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral...and where's the limit between them. i don't know if the idea of this movie is "love conquers all...even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful...no matter how or where". but in my opinion, this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think...
