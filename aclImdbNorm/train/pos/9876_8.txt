presenting lily mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress judy garland, along with her standard singing moments. the plot consists of lily mars tagging along after producer john thornway for her big break. i think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. i really recommend this film for everyone. judy is breathtaking in this role!
