in an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, timmy, finds a friend in fido (billy connelly), his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie.<br /><br />fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous carrie-anne moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!).<br /><br />timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. with the authorities on fido's trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?<br /><br />a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. taking the romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town america is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that i have seen.<br /><br />connelly's fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame, along with day of the dead's bub, and return of the living dead's tarman; it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse, but the big yin's performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! the rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young k'sun ray (as timmy) and ms.moss deserving special mentions
