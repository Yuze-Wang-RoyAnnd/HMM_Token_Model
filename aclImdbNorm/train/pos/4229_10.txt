don't waste time reading my review. go out and see this astonishingly good episode, which may very well be the best columbo ever written! ruth gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son-in-law to avenge his murder of her daughter. columbo is his usual rumpled, befuddled and far-cleverer-than-he-seems self, and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between gordon and falk. ironically, this was not written by heralded creators levinson or link yet is possibly the densest, most thoroughly original and twist-laden columbo plot ever. utterly satisfying in nearly every department and overflowing with droll and witty dialogue and thinking. truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all. 10/10...seek this one out on netflix!
