in one of neil simon's best plays. creaky, cranky ex-vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special. the problem is they haven't even seen each other in over a decade. full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes, this story flies along with a steady stream of humor. good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew, rosetta lenoire as the nurse, and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director. steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves. trivia note: the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler, bessie love, polly moran, cliff edwards, charles king, gus edwards, and the singing brox sisters.
