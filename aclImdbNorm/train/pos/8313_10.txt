first of all, i think the below comment is unworthy for a site like this. obviously you have no taste and you don't respect the taste of others. not to give you a history lesson but i think it needs to be done. black actors out there are just, if not more, successful as others. if you are not a part of the "black" race you cannot understand the quality, creativeness, and vibrant of old movies such as "sparkle" and "mahogany" and "cooley high." since unfortunately you are not black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics, so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non-dancing race. thanks.
