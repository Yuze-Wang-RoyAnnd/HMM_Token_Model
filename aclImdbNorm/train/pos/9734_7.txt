well here comes another,well,romantic comedy...but unlike all others movies of this genre,this is by far the best i have seen in a long while..<br /><br />i'll admit,at first i wanted to watch this movie because of megan fox,and a little because of simon pegg...<br /><br />first of all,if you have watched a decent amount of movies,you will know that sidney and alison would be together at the and of the movie,one way or another...but from the beginning to the end of the movie you won't know how...<br /><br />okay,now this movie is just made for simon pegg.i can't see any other actor in the role of sidney,and i'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for pegg's great performance.<br /><br />there is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard,courtesy of simon pegg's character sidney...but i think everyone in this movie is good.for example,kirsten dunst is really solid in this movie( i usually don't think of her as any more than an average actress,but she was really good in this one ),then there's jeff bridges,there's gillian anderson,and of course megan fox who plays spoiled bitchy star sophie maes...great role for her...<br /><br />all in all,while i usually don't agree with ratings her on imdb,this time i would completely agree with them...<br /><br />go and see this movie,it is really light-hearted and positive,and i recommend it deeply... my rating 7 out of 10...well 7.5 actually...
