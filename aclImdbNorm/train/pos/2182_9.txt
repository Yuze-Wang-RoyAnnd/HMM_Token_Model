this superb film draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form - levant, crosby, martin, rathbone, manone are completely at home in the story that apparently was supplied by billy wilder. one would love to know more about how much he had to do with it, because it's an exceptionally clever variation on the sterile master/fertile servant tale - nearly an allegory of the entertainment industry, run by dried-up numskulls, but made into a vibrant world of art and play by an exploited underclass of nobodies and non-wasps. looking at the last six decades of music, tv, and film in the us, it's hard not to see the underlying insights of this film as prophetic.
