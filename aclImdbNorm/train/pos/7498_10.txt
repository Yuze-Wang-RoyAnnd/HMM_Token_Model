this is a bizzare look at al's "life", back when he still a hyper 20-something. the (real) home videos of al as a kid are great, and the commentary from his (real life) parents gives a nice glimpse of just how weird al wound up as screwed up as he is. this video is a must own for any devoted al-coholic.
