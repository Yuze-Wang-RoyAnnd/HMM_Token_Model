like the jeffersons, good times was one of the those classic american sitcoms which was never aired in the uk, not to mention it came out in the 1970s- a decade where of which i wasn't born yet.<br /><br />but like most fans of the show, i watched a few episodes on you tube- and afterwards, i loved it.<br /><br />the evans family are headed by james and florida- two parents trying to make ends meet, and who despite their lack of qualifications, encourage their children, who have their own aspirations in life to fulfil them and to take their chances. james was the strict but loving dad, who didn't dare hesitate in disciplining j.j, michael and thelma- should they over-step the line. whilst florida, in contrast was a fair, kind- hearted and considerate mother and loving wife, although she was in many ways similar to james, with regards to their attitudes to parenthood and family values from an afro- american perspective.<br /><br />the kids were just as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves: j.j was an aspiring artist with a goofy personality and crazy sense of humour, who would often wear multi-coloured outfits, and whose 'dy-no-mite' catchphrase is as infectious and familiar as arnold jackson's 'whatchoo talking' 'bout willis?' from diff'rent strokes. michael was the smart-alec, who dreams of becoming a lawyer, whilst sister thelma had her own dreams and hopes. her verbal taunts with j.j were mostly hilarious, as was the love/hate relationship between brother and sister, which was played out extremely well by both mike evans and bernadette stanis.<br /><br />over the seasons, there were a few cameo appearances made, most notably from janet jackson, debbie allen and a young gary coleman as himself! i actually prefer good times over say, the cosby show, which was an 80s show because a) i preferred the evans family over the huxtables, both in terms of a) characterisation and b)as i felt it tackled serious and difficult social issues, in a way that resonated with many viewers. it was a comedy but it was also a social commentary which aimed to highlight the lives of working class, afro- americans in 1970s america. the cosby show attempted to cater to the mainstream audience in a 'candy coated' way, as the huxtables were portrayed as blacks who easily assimilated themselves into an upper-class u.s culture we would associate whites with, whereas good times in contrast was much more 'edgier' and it was not afraid to address themes such as drug and child abuse in a realistic way. i actually found that whilst the cosby show can be fun to watch at times, it lacked that bit of 'sassiness' which good times has and of which made it trendier and cooler.<br /><br />the show did jump the shark during the latter seasons, as it continued after john amos's character, james died in a freak accident (in reality, it was known at the time that john had quit good times for good. and so, his character's death was written as it is on the show). without john, the show suffered and alas, it lost a lot of its charm.<br /><br />still, for a sitcom, good times ticked all the right boxes. if only they had shown this in the uk during the 80s. as it certainly is, as jj would put it, 'dy-no-mite!!' <br /><br />my rating: 8 and a half
