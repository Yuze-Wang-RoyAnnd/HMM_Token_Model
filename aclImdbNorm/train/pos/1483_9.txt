a sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage. the main thrust of the narrative arises from a 'homily' spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from milan. in it, the future course of the marriage is spelled out, which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life. the 'moral' of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out, both now, and in the past, it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends. this film was a relative blockbuster by domestic italian standards. it's a terrible shame that this film is not available in either dvd or vhs.
