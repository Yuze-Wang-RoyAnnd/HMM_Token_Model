wizards of the lost kingdom is a movie about a young prince (simon) who is banished from his kingdom due to his father (the king) being killed by the cliche "evil adviser". this movie's about simon's adventures. the special effects, plot, acting, and generally everything about this movie is bad. however, it's so bad that it's funny. you will keep watching this movie simply because it's so bad it's funny, and, like the other reviewer of the movie said, it's so bad it's good.
