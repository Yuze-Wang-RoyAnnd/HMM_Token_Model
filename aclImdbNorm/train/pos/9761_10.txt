now here's a film straight out of my childhood, my family used to taped; but it kind of got tapped over and losted over the years. now i was fortunate to watch the whole film on youtube.com; i had love this wonderful film when i watched it as kid, and after watching again (online), i still do today. my favorite song from the movie is "candy hearts and paper flowers" (i will always remember that sweet song forever). <br /><br />i was surprised when i looked at the opening credits (on who animated who),that some of the animators date back to 1930s (wow! that's like 47 years).
