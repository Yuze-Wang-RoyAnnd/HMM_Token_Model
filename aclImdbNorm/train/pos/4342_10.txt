this movie didn't really surprise me, as such, it just got better and better. i thought: "paul rieser wrote this, huh? well...we'll see how he does..." then i saw peter falk was in it. i appreciate colombo. even though i was never a big fan of the show, i've always liked watching peter falk. <br /><br />the performances of peter and paul were so natural that i felt like a fly on the wall. they played off of each other so well that i practically felt giddy with enjoyment! ...and i hadn't even been drinking!<br /><br />this movie was so well done that i wanted to get right on the phone to paul and let him know how much i enjoyed it! but i couldn't find his number. must be unlisted or something.<br /><br />this was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything. it just came on and i thought:"eh, why not? let's see. if i don't like it - i don't have to watch it..." ...and i ended up just loving it!
