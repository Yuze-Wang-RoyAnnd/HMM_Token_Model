a charming, funny film that gets a solid grade all around. i saw a screener of this film recently at work. it was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies i see every day. so much so, that i figured i'd write in. not sure if this film is going to theaters, but i hope it does. its a nice film to see with friends, its a charmer, and has some funny jokes. the acting was terrific (especially howard hessman and larry dorf. the directing was pretty good (not a film that needed to be over-directed). what really makes this film stand out i think is the writing. it was like neil simon, seinfeldish, and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm. as an aspiring screenwriter, i notice those things! (i'm a dork). anyway, a really cute film that i recommend.
