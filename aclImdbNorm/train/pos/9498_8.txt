"painting is seeing, then remembering better than you saw." so says dick heldar (ronald colman), the painter in the light that failed.the movie is in the grand old hollywood style, starring ronald colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes ida lupino in her first important role, dependable character actor dudley digges (who also co-starred with colman in condemned.),and a solid performance by the wonderful actor walter huston.<br /><br />the title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that dick will lose his sight. he's blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart maisie (muriel angelus) are playing with a pistol. later a wound while fighting in the sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. he becomes a famous painter, but he's already blinded by ambition, and doesn't really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him. enter bad girl bessie (ida lupino), and his self destruction is set in motion. lupino is very powerful in this role and plays off colman very well. her evil tart reminds me of bette davis in of human bondage. <br /><br />well acted and well directed, this is one of my favorite colman melodramas.
