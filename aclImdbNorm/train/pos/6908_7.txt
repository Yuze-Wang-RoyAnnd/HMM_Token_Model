richard dreyfuss stars in "moon over parador," a 1988 paul mazursky film also starring raul julia, sonia braga, jonathan winters and charo. dreyfuss plays a new york actor, jonathan nolan, in the caribbean country of parador to make a film. when the dictator dies suddenly, the secret police chief (julia) who is the one actually controlling the dictator and the country, drafts jonathan to play the dictator, having noticed the resemblance between them. soon jonathan is ensconced in the palace as alphonse simms, and simms' prostitute girlfriend madonna (braga) who realizes the switch promises to help him in any way she can.<br /><br />mazursky, who appears in drag as simms' mother, gives us a look at how the cia operates in third world countries. the winters character, supposedly a salesman, is actually a cia operative. the film, however, flirts with but doesn't really tread on very serious ground and is more of a send-up, and a funny one at that.<br /><br />richard dreyfuss does a fabulous job as jonathan the actor and alphonse the dictator, creating two separate characters and nailing both. the gorgeous sonia braga is great as madonna, and raul julia hands in a wickedly funny performance as strausmann, the man behind the dictator. it's one of those performances where you never quite know what the character is thinking - he can be pleasant or turn psycho at any moment. charo is on hand as a maid and manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time.<br /><br />a very good film, not a big blockbuster, but very entertaining.
