after seeing this film i feel like i know just a little bit more about the usa. david lynch is synonymous with shock value and weird for weirdness sake, and indeed these elements are not missing from the straight story. however it is in a light that i have not witnessed from lynch before. we begin with a simple family living a quiet life but end up with an array of absurdly interesting characters with depth in their lives that cannot be apparent from their introduction. especially moving was the bar scene with two wwii veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their current lives and emotions. if you are looking for wild at heart or dune, don't look here. but if you are looking for real people with real stories this is the film for you.
