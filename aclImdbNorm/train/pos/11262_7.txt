the devil's plaything is my second attempt at a joseph sarno production - and although i will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic swedish wildcats, it is still a little slow and un-explicit for my taste.<br /><br />this one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle, that want to resurrect their previously murdered "leader". in order to do so, the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff - and of course drink some blood, too. when a doctor and her brother's car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging - they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires...but they may not be as helpless as they seem...<br /><br />the devil's plaything is a pretty good example of early 70's exploit sleaze. lots of nudity - including some full-frontal, some sleazy undertones - including incest and of course, lesbo-bloodsucking...but these scenes are still pretty tame by today's standards. some pretty hot women in this one, would have benefited from some more explicit sex, but i guess ya can't have it all. also would have benefited from some heavier violence/gore, being that it is a vampire film, but i think the purpose of the devil's plaything was more to showcase skin, not blood. still a little slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but that's to be expected from something from this era and of this budget. worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking. 7/10
