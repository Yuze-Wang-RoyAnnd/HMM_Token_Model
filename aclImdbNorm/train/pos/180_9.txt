when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with, a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else. this ova is kinda the opposite. though there're only half a dozen episodes, it isn't filled with action, but emotional things. the two main action sequences in this, i believe, are enough to satisfy me. after seeing so many gundam series, movies, and ovas, i was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie. this movie did a fantastic job of that. what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people. it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they're depicted as the second rise of evil nazis. most people that don't like anime that i've forced to watch this movie (lol), liked it. so, i'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story. if you're a gundam fan, and haven't seen this, you shouldn't be reading this; you should already be watching it right now.
