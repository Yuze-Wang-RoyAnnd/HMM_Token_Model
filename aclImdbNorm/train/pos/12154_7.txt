yes, a tap dancing horror thriller........with shelley and debbie! goody goody. this is demented and campy fun and part of the guignol cycle of the 60s that leaked into the 70s. released as a double feature with the burt reynolds comedy fuzz this mad scare is so bonkers as to be throughly entertaining. like a mix of day of the locust, the other and baby jane, i suggest any prospective viewer take on the idea that this is almost meant to be skew-iff and sit with someone with whom you can shriek and elbow all through it. actually, get drunk whilst you watch it.....on cheap champagne. again, with many 30s film ideas they are also about delusion; the struggle of the time for a better life getting bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder. but this one is just plain crazy. it also reminds me a lot of bloody mama the de niro - winters shlock fest that makes this film look positively glorious.
