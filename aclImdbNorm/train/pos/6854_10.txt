intelligent, stylish, and compelling thriller from the great brian de palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films!<br /><br />when troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer.<br /><br />dressed to kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason. de palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense. the finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish'.it's a truly edge of your seat shocker. even more impressive though is de palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own. dressed to kill is also a very erotic film, but mainly in a strangely beautiful way. pino donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film.<br /><br />the cast is another strong feature of this film. michael cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. angie dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife. nancy allen's performance as an involved street-walker is solid. a young keith gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son.<br /><br />many criticize de palma's films for having hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. but any similarities between hitchcocks works and de palmas can only be seen as a good quality, as calling this film a 'rip-off' would be degrading to a fine thriller. dressed to kill is a must see for all cinema fans.<br /><br />**** out of ****
