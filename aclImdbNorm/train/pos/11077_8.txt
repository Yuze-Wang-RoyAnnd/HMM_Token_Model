first of all, don't go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock, this is a different sort of gangster film.<br /><br />i saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience. it's the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that? that was awful, and the other half will leave thinking what was that? that was cool. personally i like films that i don't understand, i.e.mullholland drive, and usual suspects, so i enjoyed revolver. <br /><br />it definitely wasn't perfect though. i saw the big twist coming a mile away, at least part of it, and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good, revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed. also some scenes, like the animation, and the scene where sorter goes on a killing spree(actually one of my favourites), although, awesome scenes to watch, seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch, not because they fit in with the movie.<br /><br />however there were many good things too. i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors, jason stratham, ray liotta, vincent pastore, and even andre benjamin(who was a pleasant surprise). this movie definitely kept my interest, with one great, suspenseful, action packed, scene after another. when ray liotta was being held under the table wow....well you have to see it. the script was extremely well done, and the soundtrack, as with most guy ritchie films, was great.<br /><br />though a step below such movies as,fight club, mullholland drive, and usual suspects, it was still an awesome fast paced, psychological, action movie, with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over.
