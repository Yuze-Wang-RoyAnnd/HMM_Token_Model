well i do disagreed with the other comment posted. piedras is much much better them magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned.<br /><br />specially about non real characters, i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the spanish society like i did (and i'm not spanish), is a very real film with real characters, very well done by one of the best spanish actress antonia san juan.<br /><br />about be a european film in contrast with an american film, well we different societies, personally i dislike american modern films a lot (i like the classics and some of the andy american films but they are very few).<br /><br />is a film about the continuous constitution of a person, liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes.
