corny! i love it! corny - just as the tv show was about 40 years ago! adam and burt rekindle the same on-screen chemistry that never seems to have left! they re-live old memories, plus the actors that play them from the 1960s show some behind-the-scenes things which are quite interesting to know. 1960s tv was corny escapism for so many of us back then, and this dvd is no exception, if you are familiar with the original tv show. the fight scene with the written boofs and bams or whatever is fantastic!! the movie theater scene shows clips of the villains who passed away. at the end frank gorshin makes an appearance. he passed away not too long after this dvd was made, i believe, so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to adam and burt, just as he did to batman & robin so many years ago. he didn't lose his touch! thanks to julie newmar to re-living a villain role, also. in conclusion i think that this dvd is for great memories, and i wish to thank both adam and burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original-!!! thanks, guys!!!
