an excellent movie. superb acting by mary alice, phillip m. thomas, and a young irene cara. tony king was very realistic in his role of satin. this movie was one of the last predominately "all black" movies of the 70's and unlike the "blaxploitation" movies of that era, this movie actually had a plot, and was very well done. the movie soundtrack, sung by aretha franklin, was popular on the r&b charts at the time.
