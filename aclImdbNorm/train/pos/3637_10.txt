this was truly a great movie. i loved dennis quaid and the entire baseball team. jay hernandez is also a very likable actor that is very enjoyable to watch. the chemistry the team had once they got things together was spectacular, it just goes to show what you what can accomplish when minds unite as one with one goal. this team came back from the brink, having multiple losing seasons to winning just about everything. i love movies like this as they really are very inspirational.<br /><br />on top of that, dennis quaid's character getting a place in the major leagues. you can't do anything, but root for this guy. it just seems like when someone is supposed to do something, they are going to do that. things just happen to fall into place and makes everything click.<br /><br />based on a true story, this film will really make you think about the fact that "nothing is impossible."
