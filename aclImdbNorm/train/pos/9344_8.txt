i have to admit, this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears. however, i always think about things twice, and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable, i prefer taking the risk of a closer look.<br /><br />first what's first: the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow-paced movie that doesn't try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 9/11. thumbs up for this stroke of genius, because, unlike stone's world trade center this film fortunately doesn't focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which, similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion, is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating. the psychological impact, the sheer devastation that 9/11 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the american people is almost palpable in this movie. i think binder managed an astute observation of the american post 9/11 society and sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscar.<br /><br />however: in the film blood diamond, the di caprio character says and i quote: "ah, these americans. always want to take about their feelings". now, i don't want to belittle their suffer'ings, but i sure would like to make a comparison. ever since 9/11 the entire world is confronted with mementos, memorials and commemorations of 9/11. the hollywood industry and writers such as safran foer more than allude to 9/11 in their works. now, this huge amount of cultural products, dealing with 9/11, turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century. the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject, and i say this with all due respect, blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion.<br /><br />fact is: people die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people. we have a war in iraq, in afghanistan, in birma and lots of other countries. on a daily basis, we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their lives don't have much in common with our western lives. africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way america can. so, what i am saying is this: the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11. not a day goes by without a newspaper article, a film or a book that discusses 9/11.<br /><br />in conclusion: i commiserated with charlie fineman, but i wasn't sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a hutu who lost his entire family in the rwandan civil war.<br /><br />you catch my thrift?
