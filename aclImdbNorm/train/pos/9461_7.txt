steve carell stars as a person who you can relate to(sort of) in dan in real life, a film which i expected not to like but ended up liking it. not that the movie is laugh out loud funny it's just that it has a big heart. we all like steve carell, this isn't what fans of the office would expect to see from him, but you know what, i liked this movie. <br /><br />carell stars as dan burns, a widowed father who's daughters don't really like him. one weekend, him and his daughters travel down to see his family. while there, he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman. when he gets back to his house, he finds out that his brother mitch(played by dane cook) is dating this woman(played by juliette binoche).<br /><br />dan in real life, at times, i found a bit unbelievable. are the burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things? i would highly doubt that. i don't know any family who is like that. is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up? no.<br /><br />dan in real life:***/****
