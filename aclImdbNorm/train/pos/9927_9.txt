domino is a great movie. it's about a young woman names domino harvey (kiera knightley) who becomes a bounty-hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. she joins with two fellow hunters (mickey rourke & edgar ramirez) and the adventures begin. the script is good. very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the film. the only problem i had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do, instead of the character of domino.<br /><br />even with that, kiera knightley gives a fierce performance. she shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. mickey rourke follows up his oscar-worthy performance in 'sin city' with another tough-guy performance. edgar ramirez really doesn't do anything except speak spanish every once in a while and stare at kiera. delroy lindoi gives a good supporting performance. mo'nique was herself, although she did surprise me on one particular scene. lucy liu has great chemistry with kiera knightley in her scenes with her.<br /><br />the best thing about the movie though, is the direction. tony scott's fast-paced style really brings the movie to life. the cinematography is some of the best, i've ever seen. it takes a regular movie and puts on acid. all the blacks are blacker, the whites are brighter, and it has a sort of green glow to it. the action scenes are exhilarating.<br /><br />overall: if you liked sin city & man on fire, you'll like domino.
