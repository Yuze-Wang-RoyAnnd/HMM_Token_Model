finally got to see this classic tv movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old vhs, it is a classic piece of horror. its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on dvd and vhs ... the tv horror movie. recommended for all fans of the 70's tv movie much like trilogy of terror. those interested should get the book on the subject by david deal - television fright films of the 70's. email me for a chance to see it.....its fabulous to see it again.<br /><br />it does have it problems like many tv movies they have to be rather inventive in the effects dept and even at 70 mins it can seem to drag possibly we are all used to more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical frights released today.
