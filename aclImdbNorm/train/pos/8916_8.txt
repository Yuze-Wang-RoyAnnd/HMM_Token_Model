absolutely the very first film that scared me to death. i happened catch it when my older brother(r.i.p.) was watching it. it was on a black and white tv and not really a good picture but it got me interested. shortly after, my folks bought a color set and, as luck would have it, the million dollar movie was showing it one sunday.<br /><br />i had forgotten most of the plot, but it did not take long to catch up...and i got so scared i had a hard time sleeping that night! i mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space, but you could not hear it, or see it...and once it got hold of you it was too late. even now, after all this time it still sends a shiver up my spine. a true classic, and even better a classic that i have seen scare the pants off a new generation!<br /><br />long live the blob!
