the world of the 1973 sci-fi drama soylent green is what we could be seeing if we aren't careful. it is a world in which new york city's population has topped the 40 million mark in the year 2022. overpopulation, air pollution, year-long heat waves, and food shortages are the rule. the only hope comes from a food product called soylent green. but what is this particular food stuff really made of? that question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film, based on harry harrison's 1966 novel "make room! make room!" charlton heston stars as thorne, an nypd detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive (joseph cotten). as it turns out, cotten was on the board of directors of the soylent corporation, the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing. heston believes that this wasn't just a garden-variety murder, that cotten was bumped off for a reason. he gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute "book" (edward g. robinson, in his 101st and final cinematic appearance), and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like. what robinson finds out about soylent green shocks him beyond all imagination; but before he can tell heston all of what he knows, he has himself euthanized. and when heston does indeed find out the secret of soylent green...well, that part has become immortalized into cinematic history.<br /><br />under the very professional guiding hand of director richard fleischer (the boston strangler; fantastic voyage), soylent green is a fairly grim but thought-provoking look at a dystopian future that humanity might be living if we don't curb our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources. indeed, this was a project that heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as 1968, after he had struck gold in the sci-fi genre with planet of the apes--a fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultra-conservative political philosophy comes up in conversation (after all, soylent green is hardly a tract for unrestrained capitalism). robinson, as always, is the consummate professional in his last role; the sequence where he is euthanized (as he looks at video of the world from a better era, set to the music of tchaikovsky, beethoven, and grieg) is quite simply heartbreaking. the film also benefits from solid supporting help from chuck connors (as a very convincing heavy), brock peters (as heston's superior), and leigh taylor-young as the woman who tries to help heston in his inquiries.<br /><br />it must seem easy these days to dismiss soylent green for being dated. but those who do it ought to think twice; for this film's world may end up becoming ours in actuality if we don't watch what we do with what we have today.
