this show is about three little girls. (d.j, stephanie, and michelle) their mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father danny invites his brother-in-law (jesse) and his old friend(joey). so the whole show is about living life. the girls go through life's troubles and have life lessons. they develop crushes, boyfriends, and many more. the whole show is basically about to go with the flow. you do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go. i think this show is really good and fun to watch. i grew up watching this show and still watch it today. i am glad they still air this show on television. i watch it almost every day. i rate it 10/10.
