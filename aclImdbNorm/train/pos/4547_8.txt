this could be a 10 if it wasn't for the quite predictable and hollywood-ish scenario. daniel day-lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time (why not the leading may i ask) and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level. i personally was impressed with hugh o' connor who played christy brown as a child. the very first scene i watched him was really strong. wow.
