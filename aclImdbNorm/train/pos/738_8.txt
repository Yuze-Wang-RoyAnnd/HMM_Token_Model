and this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. no matter how it evolved (at point being a movie about disco), it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out, but the principal stands in their way. think back to those rock'n'roll movies of the 50's in which the day is saved when alan freed comes to town with chuck berry to prove that rock & roll music is really cool and safe for the kids, and tuesday weld gets a new sweater for the dance. forward to the 1979, repeat the same plot, but throw in da ramones, whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century (and then for the obligatory dj guest shot, "the real" don steele). throw in, too, all the elements of a roger corman-produced comedy-exploitation film, except for the two-day shooting schedule, some of the familiar corman repertory players like clint howard, mary wournow and dick miller (there since "bucket of blood"), and you've got one of the great stoopid movies of the day. one of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it. i showed the new dvd to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner- induced haze at the drive-in, and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk, not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great ramones footage.
