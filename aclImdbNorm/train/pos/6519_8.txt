this movie has great stars in their earlier years: ingor stevens never looked prettier; yul brynner was a very convincing jean lafitte, conflicted about his piracy and desiring to keep neutrality with the united states. charlton heston did a pretty good job as andrew jackson, but some moments were a bit stilted. it's really a good flick for students to learn that part of our history, and it shows that all happy endings do not include the lovers getting together with each other--sometimes the happier ending is that they sail away and find partners of similar background who will understand them better in the long run. i have viewed it every year at least twice for 16 years now; and though it is not the best movie i've ever seen, i love it every time!
