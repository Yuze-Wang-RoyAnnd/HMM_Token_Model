curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused, irritated and frightened. the creaky old plot about about a phantom train that's said to run through the lonely english countryside at dead of night may be implausible, but it's a lot of fun. there are some wonderful old cliches like "the accident" which the locals can remember but won't talk about. but primarily the movie's a vehicle for comedian arthur askey to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits. askey's corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun. this is probably the best of askey's movies.
