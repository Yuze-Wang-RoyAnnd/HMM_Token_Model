i enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time. don't take the film all too seriously because remember it's disney and it's rated g. it's good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice, particularly the "triangle" between cruella, le pelt, and cruella's faithful valet alonso. glenn close is fantastic and really has made cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is "cured" of her fur loving ways, she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater. (i even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her 'bipolarity' as the dog loving ella.) all in all i will go see it again in theaters, i found myself enjoying it so much.
