this 1986 italian-french remake of the 1946 film of the same name turns up the heat early, and doesn't let us come up for air. the story is about a high-school student (federico pitzalis) who can't keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by dutch phenom maruschka detmers) who lives next door to the school. one day, he follows her, and his persistence pays off. there's only one problem: she's engaged to a sketchy character (riccardo de torrebruna) who may or may not have committed a heinous crime, and if he repents, will probably be let off with a slap on the wrist. also, the young woman is a little "funny in the head", and this is corroborated when we discover she has been seeing the boy's father, who is a psychiatrist. giulia's emotional instability is only equalled by her prodigious sexual desires. hot, hot, hot, from the word go, with handsome leads and a bombshell performance from detmers, who plays us like a yo-yo (as she does the boy) from scene to scene, with enough suspense to keep us guessing right up until--and even after--the end. available in r and x (!) rated versions.
