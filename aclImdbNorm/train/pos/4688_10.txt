i showed this to my 6th grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it. i loved it, too. the story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing. the cast of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well. the battle between the two cold-blooded titans is truly classic footage.<br /><br />alan root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the best documentary oscar. the copy i have doesn't have orson welles narrating it (derek jacobi) and it isn't called the "mysterious castles of clay," just "castles of clay." this makes me think that it must have been done with welles added for star power and an oscar push.<br /><br />i was lucky enough to find this vhs just recently and it is now my children's favorite movie. they brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a disney movie. if you can find this movie you are indeed lucky.
