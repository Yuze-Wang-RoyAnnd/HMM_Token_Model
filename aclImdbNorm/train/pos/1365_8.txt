he-he-hello!! this is a really fun movie. basically, in party girl, you have your fun-lovin', independent, early 90's new yorker chick. along with her party friends, she meets a mature turkish vendor. it is a comming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do. it is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman. hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a nack for throwing good parties.<br /><br />on a side note, parker posey makes this movie great. i have never been a great fan of her, but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies. there are subtle manerisms that perfected her character. if you want good laughs and a fun time, make sure to watch this movie. repeated viewings are a must.
