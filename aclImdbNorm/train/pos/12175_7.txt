what would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a hawaiian guy bar? all smooth sailing until he takes his "bachelor hat" off. what would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? what would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finance? a new low, right? well paul coleman, played comically by jason lee, leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low. i got to say this is one of his good leading roles. however i do believe his role in vanilla sky was better acted.<br /><br />his finance named karen is played by the up-and-down actress selma blair while karen's character, becky, is played by the lovely and talented julia stiles. getting back to where we left off, paul now has to deal with one arising problem to another. he gets diseases, has to deal with certain people, and has to play his lie games with stealth or any member of each of the families could get p.o'ed, including one of his relatives that hasn't had a "bowel movement" for 14 days. *vomit* all of this leads to the long awaited wedding with one hilarious scene before it recapping all the hell that paul and his brother had to go through.<br /><br />overall, a guy thing is quite funny and is all right. sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes here and there but it's a mixed movie. and if you're a canadian and a fellow fan of the ctv brett butt sitcom, corner gas, you'd recognize a small role played by fred ewanuick, the same man who plays the hilarious hank in the series. this movie is all right. it's another feather in lee's hat (quite an empty hat so far, however).<br /><br />my rating: 7/10<br /><br />eliason a.
