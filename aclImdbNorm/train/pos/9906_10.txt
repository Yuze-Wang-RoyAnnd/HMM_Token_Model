yes, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. yes, the acting does range from average to laughable. yes, it has been done so many times before. however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is. there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie. in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing. i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be; a scary, funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none.
