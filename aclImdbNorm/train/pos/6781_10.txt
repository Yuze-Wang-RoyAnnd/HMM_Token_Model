when an actor has to play the role of an actor, fictional or factual, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. in a double life,ronald coleman surpassed himself as anthony john, the tortured double personality. he put into that character all his talent and sincerity. the facial expressions, mannerisms,gait and stance spoke eloquently of what anthony john was going through while playing othello on stage. coleman also did extremely well as a shakespearean actor in those short scenes as othello that were part of this gem of a movie. closups of coleman's face as othello tortured by doubts about the fidelity of desdemona were in themselves scenes worth watching.add to that, his character's off stage desperation and only someone with coleman's depth of acting perception can achieve. it was like watching spenser tracy as dr. jekyll and mr. hyde, except this double role was much more profound and poignant. shelly winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie. it is believed that ronald coleman liked his role in this film above all others he played and went on to win the oscar for best actor in 1947. i would see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored.
