fifteen years later and paris is burning is still aflame. this is a classic in black gay films, right up there with the other honorary black gay films, the color purple and mahoganoy. this seminal work captures underground and underclass (i.e."underserved) black and latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since, including all the sentimental harlem rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings. they're good, but this is the best (dare i say the only "real") film you'll find on the subject. it's relentlessy cunty (the classic house music invention)comes to hollywood, non-stop, hilarious camp (like only we do it) and dead-on social critique. all this by a white female director (who obviously must have been a sister gurl or mizz thing in a former life.) i could go on, but i think you get the point by now: i love this movie!
