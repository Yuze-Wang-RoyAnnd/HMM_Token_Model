rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity. reichdeutch women find that their jewish husbands have been locked up pending deportation. one an aristocrat disowned by her family, lena fischer, finds herself among the mob as does general gudarian's sister. but rank and privilege merit no special consideration. <br /><br />nor does service to the reich as a female detainee whose husband is on the ostfront will learn. in one of the most horrifying scenes of the movie, the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier husband. <br /><br />lest you think this is typical german brutishness we in america today have lady bush imperiously ordering the arrest of gold star mothers (mothers of us service-members killed in action) because their very presence is offencive. little, regrettably, has changed in the 60 years from der fuher to der fumbler.<br /><br />fortunately the eight year old daughter ruth escapes capture.<br /><br />waiting in the cold on rosenstrasse lena fischer is at first reluctant to take in ruth responding in a way that we take as typically german. even lena fisher's brother colonel arthur von eschenbach who is aware of and opposed to the holocost cautions lena against it. but lena chooses to embrace the idea with an american rebelliousness even renaming ruth, the more aryan sounding name helga lehmann.<br /><br />the siege ends favourably on rosenstrasse but lena mourns: what happened to ruth after the war? years later ruth's daughter hannah sets out in search of her mother's past and meets 90 year old lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war.<br /><br />i did deem it interesting that hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the ostfront.
