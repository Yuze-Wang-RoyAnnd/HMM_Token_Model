"shore leave" is mostly an average star trek adventure. nothing wrong with the episode, though. i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans. it is lightweight entertaining, nothing more. however, i'm glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. in this episode, kirk decides to grant his crew some time off, and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. as usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be. there are some action and tense moments, but most of the story is played for laughs. good, but unexceptional.
