definitely a very good idea,screenplay was just ok.could have been better,the positives are that it doesn't bore you if you're an adventure lover,a new idea about the lost world of atlantis.negatives are that i personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than this.they should've ended up with a better adventure than this.it wasn't bad at all but it would have been much better with some more runtime.enjoyed it a lot though,cant say that it was boring or wasn't good..a good one for the people who like adventure animations like sindbad,like the road to el dorado.this movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending.
