when i started watching "fay grim", i had no idea that it was a sequel to "henry fool". now, the latter was not a movie that i envisioned as having a sequel. but one has arrived, and it's quite good. i assume that you've seen the original, so i won't explain it. this one starts with fay (parker posey) living with her son whom she had with deadbeat henry (thomas jay ryan). simon (james urbaniak) is still in jail. one day, the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school. but this is no ordinary toy. it holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie. and this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than "syriana".<br /><br />i must say that i'm quite impressed with what hal hartley has accomplished here. maybe this one doesn't quite reach the original's quality, but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world. and the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel.<br /><br />also starring jeff goldblum.
