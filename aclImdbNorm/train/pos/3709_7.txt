any screen adaptation of a john grisham story deserves a mainstream hollywood approach, and robert altman is about the last director i would go to for a mainstream take on anything. but this southern-fried pot-boiler is pretty good. while it's not among altman's best, it certainly isn't among the films he's made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking.<br /><br />altman had tipped his hat to the mystery thriller with noir overtones before, in his 1973 film "the long goodbye." "the gingerbread man" is nowhere near as good as that film, but it holds up fairly well on its own. kenneth branagh is a cocky attorney who finds himself framed for murder after he gets involved with a client (embeth davidtz) who has enlisted his help in protecting her from her cuckoo father (robert duvall). the film is set in savannah, georgia during the approach of a tropical storm, which lends the film an oppressive atmosphere that i very much liked. the twists and turns toward the film's end become clunkier and clunkier, and altman proves himself to be not all that adept at staging shootouts, but overall the film is not a bad addition to altman's canon.<br /><br />also starring robert downey, jr., daryl hannah, tom berenger and famke janssen.<br /><br />grade: b
