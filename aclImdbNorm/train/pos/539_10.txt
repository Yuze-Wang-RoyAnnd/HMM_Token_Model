the first was good and original. i was a not bad horror/comedy movie. so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch it.<br /><br />what really makes this movie work is judd nelson's character and the sometimes clever script. a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay. sometimes there's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy-look.<br /><br />great made-for-tv movie. it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson's stanley doing what he does best.<br /><br />i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel, just so you'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background.
