*!!- spoilers - !!*<br /><br />before i begin this, let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the "authorized version" of this movie, remade by stephen king, himself, in 1997.<br /><br />both advantages made me appreciate this version of "the shining," all the more.<br /><br />also, let me say that i've read mr. king's book, "the shining" on many occasions over the years, and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work, stanley kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling ... and scary.<br /><br />kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film. in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay, itself, he acquired the title "magus" beyond question. kubrick's genius is like magic. the movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999. among his other outstanding credits are: eyes wide shut, 1999; full metal jacket, 1987; barry lyndon, 1975; a clockwork orange, 1971; 2001: a space odyssey, 1968; spartacus, 1960 and many more.<br /><br />the torrences (jack, wendy his wife and danny, their son) are living in the overlook hotel for the winter; jack has been hired as the caretaker. it is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until spring when the overlook reopens its doors. it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the colorado mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway.<br /><br />the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. it lent to the atmosphere, by having a dark, yet at the same time "welcoming" atmosphere, itself. the furnishings and furniture was all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook, it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world.<br /><br />the introduction of wendy and danny's characters was a stroke of genius. you get the whole story of their past, danny's "imaginary friend," tony, and the story of jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice, neat introductory scene. there was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, kubrick saw that from the beginning.<br /><br />closing day. again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel (this time, with family in tow), the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange.<br /><br />the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking, even as the "staff" is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, dormants and crown moldings in the architecture. "they did a good job! pink and gold are my favorite colors." (wendy torrence) even the "staff wing" is well designed and beautifully built.<br /><br />the maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the minotaur of crete was guardian. when jack nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center, seeing wendy and danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there's something seriously wrong, already starting. "i wouldn't want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out." (the hotel manager)<br /><br />scatman cruthers, as dick halloran, was genuine and open in his performance. his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. you could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and "doc." his explanation of "the shining" to danny was very well delivered, as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel. it was believable and sincere.<br /><br />the cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air swirling about, mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie. it also marks the "half-way-to-hell" point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie.<br /><br />shelley duvall's portrayal of wendy torrence was masterful. (so what if she also played olive oyl?! it just shows her marvelous diversity!) honestly, before i saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, i said," what? olive oyl? *lol* (popeye was also released in 1980.) but i took that back as soon as the movie started. she's brilliant. in this fiend's opinion, this is her best performance, to date! (although i did love her in steve martin's "roxanne," 1987.)<br /><br />once kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you, the viewer, need to be in possession: the torrence's past; danny's broken arm; tony; the history of the hotel itself; the fact that danny is not "mental," but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the movie never stops scaring you.<br /><br />the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker, delbert grady (the girls having appeared several times to danny, first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel) were icons with which danny could identify, and of which he was afraid, at the same time. they were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.<br /><br />kubrick's tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father. he was..."the little boy who lives in my mouth." he would manifest in the end of danny's finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny. not like in the book, i realize, where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy, trying to save his father. kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony "took ... danny ... over." the idea of danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.<br /><br />the "woman in the shower" scene, done by lia beldan (about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before, or since) as the younger woman and billie gibson (who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since), was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting. it was dramatic, and frightening. abhorrent and scary. when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and real.<br /><br />jack quickly embarks on his trek from the "jonesing" alcoholic to a certifiable insane person. the degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick. jack's instant friendship with lloyd the bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing need of the atmosphere to which lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ..."hair of the dog that bit me." (jack torrence) in jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to jack. "orders from the house." (lloyd the bartender) nice play on words.<br /><br />when wendy find's jack's "screenplay" is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles...when he asks from the shadows, "how do you like it?" and wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant. it's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up jack is. it's very scary, dramatic and delivers a strong presence. that coupled with danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood, imposed over the scene between jack and wendy, and with the confrontational ending to this scene, make this possibly the strongest scene of the movie.<br /><br />the "redrum" scene. wow. what do i say? what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young, troubled son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that freaky little voice, exclaiming "redrum" over and over? even if it had no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of hell. it was something everyone could (and has) remember(ed). speaking of memorable scenes...<br /><br />nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history. his ad-libbed line, "heeeeere's johnny!" was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. it also goes down in horror movie history.<br /><br />the ending..? kubrick's ending was perfection. i felt it ended beautifully. no smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie. just epitomized perfection. that's all i'll say on the subject of the ending.<br /><br />who cares what was taken out?! look what kubrick put in. rent it, watch it, buy it. it's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason. it rawks!!<br /><br />*me being me* ... take this movie, and sitck it in your stephen king collection, and take the 1997 "authorized" version done by king and stick it down in the kiddie section. that's where it belongs. .: this movie rates a 9.98 from the fiend :.
