but it is kinda hilarious, at least if you grew up on weird al, like i did. it's a mockumentary about his life and career, beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins. it's uneven in places, but some of the segments are still very funny, particularly when he goes to japan. although it's not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation, and he doesn't find love however fleeting, he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street life.<br /><br />perhaps weird al isn't recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is; perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet. still, this is a funny movie.
