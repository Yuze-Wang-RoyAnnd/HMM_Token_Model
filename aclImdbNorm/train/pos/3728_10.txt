never heard of this movie,saw it on dvd.great movie,perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work.no overhyped typical hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors.no current quote "a" list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie.brought back memories of my own post vietnam war military experiences.it concentrated on the people who were sent to fight.as was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service.they were regular people too,some just weren't cut out for military life,i remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but i'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch.i highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in afganistan.basic training is a trip, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need "sensitivity training" ha!ha!ha!
