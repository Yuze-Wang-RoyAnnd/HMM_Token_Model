wow. one of the greatest movies i have ever - ever seen.<br /><br />absolutely loved it! before the opening credits were done i was glued to the screen.<br /><br />it's a sci-fi thriller - and edge of your seat whodunnit. incredible.<br /><br />i wish'd it would never end.<br /><br />lucy liu is a throwaway role. anyone could have played it. the lead actor, jeremy northram was the perfect geeky guy. <br /><br />this movie appeals to me who loved war games, sneakers, and track down.<br /><br />incredible!<br /><br />8-22-06. walt d in lv
