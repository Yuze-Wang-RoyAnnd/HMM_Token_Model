ever since i heard of the ralph bakshi version of "the lord of the rings" i wondered: what the hell is 'rotoscope' animation?!!! well... i finally found out... i saw this movie about three years ago not having any idea who ralph bakshi is... and i liked it... a lot... very good story line... it even has a little character development which is great for a cartoon... see it if you get bored with contemporary animation.... don't get me wrong... i'm not saying it's just a nice cartoon... it's a pretty good movie too...
