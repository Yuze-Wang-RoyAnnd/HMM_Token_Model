i've seen mystery men cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public ( take the imdb vote for instance), but my overall feeling is that mystery men is more fun than most films, definitely wittier than most so-called comedy films and very nearly 'clever'.<br /><br />the cast is superb; greg kinnear is excellent, as are geoffrey rush and tom waits. kinnear's limo scene with ricky jay is perfect 'spoiled movie star' and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work.<br /><br />i will admit the pacing is a little off in places, and visuals are certainly very flash bang, possibly to the detriment of further characterisation, but at the end of the day, this is high concept film making - it's about the little moments "what's up tiger lily?" - and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing.
