from rainy, dreary late winter england of early 1920s...<br /><br />---where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams--- known now as world war i...<br /><br />four women share this lovely small sunny italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying, two women who will rediscover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends...<br /><br />...these four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "makeover" for one great april vacation in early 1920's italy.<br /><br />note to would-be filmmakers. study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (probably not a film to please many men...)<br /><br />note: stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day...spring is coming...enchanted april promises you!
