i absolutely loved this soap. it has been one of my favorite. will highly recommend :)... i just love brazilian soaps, they deal with real life events. i'm really sad that the soap ended but i'm sure i'll be able to find it somewhere. for those of you who have not seen it, please see it. i loved the characters, the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains. the only thing i would have changed is the end for xica and her long life love. i can't wait to see it again and highly recommend it. xica has been by far, the best soap i have ever seen. forget everything else :)go xica.. hope you all like it as well.
