i wish i could laugh again as much as when i saw this show for the first time. i have not done so ever since.<br /><br />the strange thing is, i find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again, and again. <br /><br />eddie izzard is cultivated, is poignant, is a man of the world. he is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to "engage" in political discussion. he is above that. i would contrast him to george carlin, who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas, and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain.<br /><br />funniest guy on earth
