this is a totally delightful and unexpected film. you start by following a young person who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between bahrain and iran. if iran win they will get into the 2006 world cup in germany. the problem is the young person is a girl and girls (or women for that matter) are not allowed into football matches to "sit with men". what follows is a wonderful comedy, played with consummate skill by a small ensemble cast. the film explores the absurdity of restrictions on the freedom of women (and for that matter the young soldiers who have to corral them). there are some excellent set pieces, not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet and, of course, the stadium has no toilets for women. the camera work is of the simplest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play. yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite. great cinema? no, probably not; great entertainment - for sure.
