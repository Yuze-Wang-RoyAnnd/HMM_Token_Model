overall i would have to say that i liked the movie. some of the fight scenes are really good. especially the fight against leung ka-yan. one point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an asian to play a black man. i mean really. talk about bad taste. during a fight scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. otherwise, sammo copies bruce lee's fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 stars.
