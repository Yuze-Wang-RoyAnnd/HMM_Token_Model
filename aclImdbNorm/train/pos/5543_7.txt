very well done and spooky horror movie from poverty-row film company prc who usually put out really cheesy films like devil bat or the flying serpent. german expatriate director wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his studio-bound swamp set. gaunt and ghoulish charles middleton is effective as the strangler.
