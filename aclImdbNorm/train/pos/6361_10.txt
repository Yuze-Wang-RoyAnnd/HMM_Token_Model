i have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months. being a huge jim carrey fan, i easily saw how he could morph himself into seuss' grinch and make the character his own. i was not disappointed. <br /><br />this movie was pure magic. carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did. there was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come. i already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video, and i undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as i did the first time i saw it.<br /><br />clearly, this movie has jim carrey written all over it, and i do not believe that it would have come together without him. however, the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right, most notably the adorable taylor momsen who was the perfect foil for carrey's antics. the set design, musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical, fabulous finished product and i believe all involved can be proud. <br /><br />it is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film, but howard has succeeded with flying colours. for those critics who disagree, perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.
