a classic hollywood biopic is the best sense of the genre. gooding and deniro both give spectacularly heartfelt performances in the two leads roles, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent, with standout performances by carl lumbly and michael rapoport. <br /><br />the only "nit" i might pick is that theron's role was unnecessary & distracting (not her performance which was fine, it's just that the film seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to accommodate her role.)<br /><br />aside from that, the characterizations, dynamics, and action of the real-life story are riveting and unforgettable. the evolutions of the main characters and how what they experience evolves their beings are uniquely characterized by the performing artists. despite the movie's extreme length, the pacing stays intact throughout. the score is also terrific.<br /><br />us this a predictable hollywood film? you bet. so, mike leigh addicts should subtract a star, but everyone else should enjoy mightily.
