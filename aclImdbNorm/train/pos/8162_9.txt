as dr. alan feinstone, corbin bernsen turns a marvelously deranged performance in "the dentist".<br /><br />with his already obsessive compulsive tendencies in high gear, the irs hounding him, and a very suspicious acting wife; dr. alan feinstone is losing his sanity more and more each day.<br /><br />when the doc indeed does realize that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy, it sets off a string of events that lead to torture, murder, ant total mayhem! "the dentist" is a solid film! bernsen makes the character of dr. feinstone relatable and hateable at the same time. even though he is completely out of his gourd, the audience will still feel sympathy towards him. that my friends.....is damn good acting.<br /><br />a nice solid cast of supporting actors round out this gem of a film. excellent direction, good killings and gore, and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movies run.<br /><br />highly recommended!
