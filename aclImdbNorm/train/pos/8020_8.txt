i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie, because i felt it was the most light-hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines. the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they've written, but along the way, they run into the usual problems, including kermit's memory loss here. while there aren't as many great cameos here as in the original "muppets movie," there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman. simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great, and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious. the original songs are also good here, and the ending is satisfying. there is not much else to say about the film, but muppet fans should see it for sure. it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all.<br /><br />***1/2 out of ****
