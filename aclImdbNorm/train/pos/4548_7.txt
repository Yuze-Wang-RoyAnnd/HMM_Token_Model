at the time, "my left foot" was the little movie that could. it was hugely popular, and everyone applauded the fact that such a small, independent film could make it all the way to the oscars.<br /><br />since then, movies like "my left foot" are a dime a dozen, so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about. it's certainly a well made and competent film, but it's clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of daniel day-lewis, who immerses himself in the role of cristy brown, a man living with cerebral palsy. day-lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won dustin hoffman an oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in "rain man," and the academy followed suit by giving day-lewis the same honor.<br /><br />the only thing really separating this film from a big budget hollywood production is just that -- its budget. in every other way it's just as formulaic as any standard product. that's not to say it isn't a good movie, but it's not a masterpiece.<br /><br />grade: a-
