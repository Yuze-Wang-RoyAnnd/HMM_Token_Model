henry hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for his love of the people of the early days in us history. however, to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about brigham young and the mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film. in my opinion, hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a mormon people were in the early history of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of joseph smith to the date of film release. in often subtle filming and dialog delivery, he covered mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes.<br /><br />i remember watching this movie on many saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950's. that was just over 10 years after the films release and before the los angeles temple was completed, which i watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who mormons were. i recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that hathaway interpreted in his film.<br /><br />1. love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. charity to those in need or not, 3. family is high in importance, 4. listen respectfully and carefully, because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt, 5. work hard, both individually and in community, 6. prepare and store for future days of need, 7. hope is a binding link to a higher being, and for our daily lives, 8. and, that there is a unique quality to any group, and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial.
