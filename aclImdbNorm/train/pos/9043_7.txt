i just accidentally stumbled over this film on tv one day. it was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies. this one, however, was nothing less then good.<br /><br />october sky tells the true story of homer hickam, a boy inspired by the sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist. he and his friends begin to build rockets. his father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his brother.<br /><br />the story is well written. a bit too predictable maybe, but that's ok cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. it's important part, but where this is obvious the inner action, the action between the characters is focused on. the story is good. it has some clich'es, but that's ok. it's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clich'es. the characters are really good. where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high. you get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. they are well written and believable.<br /><br />this is a good looking movie. the sets and the 50's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. this all sets the mood of the film very good.<br /><br />the acting is really good. jake gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as homer hickam and chris cooper is good as john hickam. as for the rest of the cast they are good too. all together this makes out a pretty strong cast.<br /><br />all in all i'm glad i caught this movie. it was first after seeing it i learned that it was based on actual events. if i had known that when seeing it, it would probably just be even more interesting. october sky is a good and interesting movie. it's a movie i believe everyone can enjoy. it's kind of a feel-good movie. not bad at all!
