"bread" very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and "night of the living dead" in specific and is constantly inventive. the production values are a little rough at times (it's a student film, after all), but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain. hey -- george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered "dead" video tape, laserdisc and dvd... that should tell you something.
