the question of whether or not one likes this film version of "the ghost train" invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone: your reaction to the performance of arthur askey.<br /><br />he tends to steal almost every scene he's in, and not always in a good way. sometimes you wish he'd settle down or back off just a little, to allow the plot's many characters to feature and develop (which they do to some extent). but somehow everything keeps pointing back to askey's tommy gander character.<br /><br />personally i like the film, and even like askey to an extent. i always seem to plonk it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when i can't sleep and really can't find the energy to watch anything else. there is something about watching old b/w movies in the quiet dark of pre-dawn that i find appealing....
