convoluted, infuriating and implausible, fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. she's at once touching,funny, cunning. the supporting actors commit to it as well.<br /><br />i wont even try to tell you the plot.. it involves characters from hartley's henry fool and attempts a tale of international espionage.<br /><br />the film works well if you continue along with it-understanding it is. in a sense, completely ridiculous. it becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along. (i resisted the temptation to turn off the dvd twice).<br /><br />fay grim requires an adventurous film-goer willing to tackle something that isn't cookie-cutter. in the end, it offers something that defies description.
