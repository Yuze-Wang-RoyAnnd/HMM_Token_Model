this is the true story of how three british soldiers escaped from the german prisoner of war (pow) camp, stalag luft iii, during the second world war. this is the same pow camp that was the scene for the great escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the gestapo (and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name). <br /><br />while the other pows in stalag luft iii are busy working on their three massive tunnels (known as tom, dick & harry), two enterprising british prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence, shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom. the idea to build their version of the trojan horse came to them while they were discussing 'classic' attempts for escape and observing some pows playing leap-frog in the compound.<br /><br />initially containing one, and later with two pows hidden inside, the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position, near the fence, on a daily basis. while volunteer pows vaulted over the horse, the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire, under the wire, and into the woods. <br /><br />the story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping pows faced while traveling through germany and occupied europe after they emerged from the tunnel. all three pows who tried to escape actually hit home runs (escaped successfully to their home base.). the wooden horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a pow breakout. the movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two pows traveled in their escape. made with far less a budget than the great escape, the wooden horse is more realistic if not more exciting than the great escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the pows to make good their escape. <br /><br />the story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie. the wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees, eric williams, and is, by far, the best pow escape story ever made into a movie. some of the actual pows were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in stalag luft iii. i give this movie a well deserved ten.
