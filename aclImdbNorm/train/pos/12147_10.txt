return to the 3th chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th chamber of shaolin, in which gordon liu played shan te, a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter. in this sequel liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten. he imitates the original shan te, tries all manner of tricks to get into shaolin temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses. its a classic light hearted martial arts tale, with the ace production values of the shaw brothers and the sure footed direction of lui chia liang. the choreography is fantastic throughout, whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and gordon liu's performance, as are the others, particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material. the film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander, more violent and sweeping shaw brothers films. but few have such a magical blend of slapstick, unique training and fighting, with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good. full of light hearted joy, its impossible not to give this the highest score.
