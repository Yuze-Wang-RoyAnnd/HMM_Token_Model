this picture in 1935 walked away with all kinds of ocars for best director, john ford, actor victor mclaglen and music by max seiner. victor mclaglen,(gypo nolan), "call out the marines",'42, gave an outstanding performance as an irish rebel who belonged to a rough and tough crowd who were all fighting for a cause and at the same time getting poorer and poorer with plenty of drinking. gypo nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend in order to take a trip with his gal to america and a new way of living. preston foster, (don gallagher),"guadalcanal diary",'43, gave a great supporting role as the leader of the irish rebellion and was anxious to capture the informer of his group. gypo nolan becomes haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel just like a judas. great film for 1935 and wonderful acting by mclaglen, but rather depressing in every aspect of the film.
