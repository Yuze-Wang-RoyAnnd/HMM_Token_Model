ok, this movie is stupid. i mean that in a good way though.it was stupid on purpose, and was one of the better "stupid" movies i've seen. the jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me. the supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. there is a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine.<br /><br />elvira's character is the focus here.she is lovable and adorable.cassandra petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie.on top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly, stunning. few men could disagree with that. the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie.<br /><br />i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />highly recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women. i wish they had made a dozen more elvia movies.
