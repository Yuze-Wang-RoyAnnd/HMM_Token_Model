flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made.<br /><br />this flick exposes all the clich'es, and then some! excruciatingly bad (downs-syndrome!) actors. terribly heavy self important dialog. scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat. jarring editing. pointless plot points. all wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivel.<br /><br />it achieves exactly what it was designed to. a hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders, to show to their parents when they ask them what they've been doing for the last two years! after "what is it?" received its cannes award, presenter werner herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof, in part of his own films! he supposedly blew up at the info. to this day he refuses to discuss the incident.<br /><br />anyway, see it and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years to come.
