the cat and mouse are involved in the usual chases when jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it makes him vanish. instead of seizing the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse changing room or something, he uses his new-found invisibility to torment tom. and it's pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one-joke cartoon. and the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually the trait of below average t&j shorts. still worth a 7/10.<br /><br />however, i'm not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall, it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible itself.
