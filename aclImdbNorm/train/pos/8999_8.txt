this films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy b movie. it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy. it should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese. but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go, "hmmmmm... that's so stupid!" and then have you laughing. for example, there is a scene back in "16th century japan", which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. in the background of the temple, there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts. hmmmm... hahahah! i could not stop laughing. and the acting goes from decent, to bearable, to oh my lord, but that's what makes it funny. you'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. i have to digress somewhat though because i have seen stephanie sanchez in several plays and she is awesome. her air time in the film was pretty short though. i have also seen bryan yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie. anyhow, it's an entertaining film, if you've got nothing to do on a weekday evening.
