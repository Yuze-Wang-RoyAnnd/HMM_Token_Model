there are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality that whips latin america with regard to the kidnappings thing, the police corruption at continental level, among so many realities that we live the latins. <br /><br />the performance of denzel wahington was brilliant, this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way. dakota fanning just by 10 years, an excellent actress has become and i congratulate her. the rest of the movie was of marvel, i have it in my collection. <br /><br />i hope that they are happened to those producing of hollywood to make a movie completely in venezuela, where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency, the traffic of drugs or the political problems. they have been few the movies that they play venezuelan land (for example: aracnophobia, jungle 2 jungle, dragonfly) they should make more, as well as they make in mexico.<br /><br />the song "una mirada" i hope that it leaves in the soundtrack, it is excellent. my vote is 10/10
