i had mixed feelings for "les valseuses" (1974) written and directed by bertrand blier when i started watching it but i ended up liking it. i would not call it vulgar ("dumb and dumber" is vulgar, "the sweetest thing" is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid); i would call it shocking and offensive. i can understand why many viewers, especially, the females would not like or even hate it. it is the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way two antiheroes treat every woman they'd meet seems unspeakable. but the more i think of it the more i realize that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem. i am fascinated how blier was able to get away with it. the movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable: it is well written, the acting by all is first - class, and the music is sweet and melancholic. actually, when i think of it, two buddies had done something good to the women they came across to: they prepared a woman in the train (the lovely, docile blonde brigitte fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debuts in ren'e cl'ement's "forbidden games"(1952) at age 6) for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months; they found a man who was finally able to get a frigid marie-ange (miou-miou) exited and satisfied; they enlightened and educated young and very willing isabelle huppert (in one of her early screen appearances.) their encounter with jeanne moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level. in short, i am not sure i'd like to meet g'erard depardieu's jean-claude and patrick dewaere's pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner but i had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew - it was never boring.
