soldier may not have academy acting or lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me. i won't tell you what its about, i'm sure you already read the summary. this is a great doomed futureistic action/science fiction movie. kurt russell doesn't say much, he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character. there are great action and fight scenes; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but thats hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives. i have not seen soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites. i'm lucky enough to have a wife that digs on guy movies; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy/sci-fi movies.
