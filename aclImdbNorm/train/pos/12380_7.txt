nyc model alison parker (cristina raines) rents a room in an old brownstone where she meets a few bizarre neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations. as lawyer boyfriend michael lerman (chris sarandon) goes about making inquiries on her behalf, she struggles to maintain her sanity (not to mention her will to live) as her experiences take a toll on her physical, mental, and emotional health.<br /><br />i don't want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror film for those unfamiliar with it. the story is interesting and entertaining, but the film doesn't really offer much in terms of real scares. or, for that matter, any atmosphere. it is sort of quietly sinister, but it's not like the traditional horror film. it's more of a story about a troubled woman's attempts to deal with the increasing unreality in her life. on that level, it works, but it's not quite powerful enough.<br /><br />what "the sentinel" *does* offer are some eye-catching set pieces (in particular, the fascinating, fabulously creepy climax, and there's a scene with beverly d'angelo that must be seen to be believed). there's also some gore to be seen, but not very much. an ominous music score by gil melle adds to the menace.<br /><br />no review of this film would be complete without an appraisal for the film-makers in gathering such excellent actors for its ensemble cast. some of them don't get to do too much, but to see all of them together is impressive. eli wallach and burgess meredith make the biggest impressions as, respectively, a hard-nosed detective and a solicitous neighbor. other legendary names include jose ferrer, arthur kennedy, and ava gardner. future stars like d'angelo, christopher walken, tom berenger, jeff goldblum make brief appearances, and other familiar faces include jerry orbach, sylvia miles, william hickey, and martin balsam. whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prize.<br /><br />written for the screen by director michael winner, probably best known for the "death wish" series that he did with charles bronson, from the novel by jeffrey konvitz.<br /><br />i wouldn't consider this a truly great horror thriller but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining.<br /><br />7/10
