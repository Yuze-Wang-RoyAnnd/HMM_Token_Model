ride with the devil has something rich and special, if you can stand the slow development. while tackling a dark, gritty subject, the brutal guerrilla war in the american west during its civil war (which in turned spawned the outlaws of the old west of the 1870s), the movie maintains a strangely satisfying, unmanipulated atmosphere. what i'm refering to is the tendency of films' music and lighting to make you feel the mood you'd expect to feel. but rwtd instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack, and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewer's senses.<br /><br />as an enthusast of this particular area of cw history, i'm greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film. the diologue is expertly written, (even with subtle humor occasionally) with references to bushwhackers and previous boarder battles (independence for example...a far cry from the oregon trail!). the minor events that occur to jake's band are similar to actual events that took place...especially the attack when they're holed up in the house, and the destruction of the store/booth. the battle scenes, though rare, are pretty well executed. it even has the first cw cavalry battle put on film recently.<br /><br />the directing shows the talent everyone expects of ang lee in subtle ways. example: the character of black john is shown taunting a lawrence resident during the massacre: "where's your army? who are we to fight!? who are we to fight?! (the shot then switches to a trio of confederate regulars standing, doing nothing to stop the carnage while the voice continues) you are cowards all!" who are the cowards, really? little touches like that really enhance the movie's quality.<br /><br />there are no major glaring areas in the history, something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film glory, which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows. some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented don't add up. but you will never notice that. a larger curiosity is the fact that the only african-american man-at-arms character in the film is the quasi-slave fighting for jake and his confederate bushwhackers. it is true that some blacks did fight for the confederacy out there, including one who scouted lawrence for quantrill before the attack (who would suspect him?). though this black rebel is a fasinating character (whatever pc african-americans might think of him), not a single black union infantryman is seen in the film, which would have been more represenative of the black experience in the western cw. one of the first black regiments of the cw was raised in kansas (by the murderer senator jim lane, and before the 54th mass. reg. of fame was organized), and black troops in such battles as baxter springs, ks, played a critical role.<br /><br />no glaring historical errors. good, realistic action, which is infrequent and not gratitous. good directing. this film may not be the blockbusters other recent civil war were, but it's the cleanest job of any.
