blade runner (deckard is a replicant!), <br /><br />city of lost children (augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly, well, just giving us far less than what we might dream of), and<br /><br />dark city: <br /><br />these really ought to be added.<br /><br />for a while now, i've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as miyazaki's stuff has. this one is the 1st.<br /><br />hmm, scratch the "animated" part of that.<br /><br />i have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don't leave, it must be mostly love, right? but, there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a wonder to watch.<br /><br />these people did an incredible job!
