when friendship kills, in my opinion, is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. anytime lexi (katie wright) or jennifer (marley shelton) threw up, i wanted to vomit myself. it's kind of hard to explain why. if you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things. however, i did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say, "if you ask me, when friendship kills does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person's body. " now, in conclusion, i recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it. you're in for some tears and a good time, so the next time it's on tv, kick back with a friend and watch it.
