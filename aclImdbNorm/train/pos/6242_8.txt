i agree with the previous comment in naming the film's content "everyday madness" but would like to specify that: "dog days" is about how women are treated in (a male) society. the episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women, mostly categorized by age group. there is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had, treating her like a doll that shall act "worthy of wearing" the former's dress. there is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a (violent) master. further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend/wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitor(s). a young adult man makes clear to his friend - a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him - that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette. finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simple-minded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who - taking her for guilty in having scratched his car - natural beats her up. to complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the "master-slave"-couple - after collectively abusing her - threatening and humiliating the former "in her sake" for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new "master". during all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summer-sun - absolutely motionless (sic!). unfortunately i have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men, but what i have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization.
