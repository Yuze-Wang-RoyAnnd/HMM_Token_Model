i had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment "uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie." thus entereth the "almighty solo movie night"!<br /><br />anyway, i found welcome to collinwood a rather enjoyable movie. while ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments. i was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. george clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better if mr. clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. how do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? the cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so i consider it a success! rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. you'll have a good time.<br /><br />***7/10***<br /><br />on a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. it's great to hear the far under appreciated paolo conte used, and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled.
