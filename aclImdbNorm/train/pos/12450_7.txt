rented and watched this short (< 90 minutes) work. it's by far the best treatment modesty has received on film -- and her creator, peter o'donnell, agrees, participating as a "creative consultant." the character, and we who love her, are handled with respect. spiegel's direction is the best he's done to date, and the casting was very well done. alexandra staden is almost physically perfect as a match to the original jim holdaway illustrations of modesty. a terrific find by whoever cast her! raymond cruz as a young rafael garcia was also excellent. i hope that tarantino & co. will go on to make more in the series -- i'm especially interested to see whom they'd choose to be the incomparable willie garvin!
