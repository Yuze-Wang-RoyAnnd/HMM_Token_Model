i was not really a big fan of star trek until past 2-3 years. thanks to the advent of netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes. for those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart, through tng, ds9, voyager, etc., general popular consensus will say -- "i like the next generation" the best. that's because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation. but to be quiet honest, i appreciate the creativity of voyager's episodes more than tng. voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike tng. granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyager's doctor -- now that's creativity! instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best! endgame portray him as a husband married to an "organic", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before endgame, to disobey captain's order and make "human" mistakes. unlike ds9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode, voyager has to survive 3 seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality. of course the rest of the voyager's cast chemistry just flows effortless, harry kim and tom paris -- very natural. i love tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a vulcan. finally, i'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh, if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank god for kate! she has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. what a great job! thank you star trek for making voyager, i enjoy every episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, of morals, and of our cosmic expanse.
