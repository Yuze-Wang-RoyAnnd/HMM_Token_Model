they did it. and, boy, did they do it fantastically or what! the bbc finally brought the doctor back to our screens on a saturday evening where he belongs! and they did it with style! <br /><br />episode one: "rose" - one of the strengths of the new series is russel t davies as a writer and executive producer. he's a fan of the show and knows what the other fans want, but also is an experienced writer in his own right, so knows what other people want. another strength, as perfectly shown here in this first episode, is billie piper and her character of rose tyler. finally the doctor's companion gets a credible back story and a strong character. also nice to see the return of the autons - a nice nod to the classic series there.<br /><br />episode two: "the end of the world" - in the start of this double bill to show off the tardis' strengths, we end up in a story where special effects is everything! they now have the technology to create real, believable environments and monsters - no more rubber suits of sorts! also the hints at the end of this episode regarding the new doctor's past - very intriguing to kill off all the time lords and make him the only one.<br /><br />episode three: "the unquiet dead" - we've had the future, now lets have the past. the first non-davies written episode is a little flat in some places, but this is made up for by simon callow's charles dickens and the sudden twist in the plot when it is revealed the pitiful gelf are not so pitiful after all...<br /><br />episode four: "aliens of london" - the consequences of the doctor's actions are fully explored in this series, not least with the repercussions of rose running off with him. also, we have our first cliffhanger; not the best of ones admittedly. the slitheen are an interesting villain, though they can look too cgi for their own good.<br /><br />episode five: "world war three" - the second part of this story about the slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems of the first. also, the clips from the next episode coming up at the end of the current episode are annoying and spoil it for people.<br /><br />episode six: "dalek" - yes! we've had the future, the past, and the present(ish), but now we get to the good stuff - the return of the doctor's arch-nemesis. here i think we can complement christopher ecclestone - he was brilliant as the doctor, and no more so then in this episode, where we see the pain on his face as he recollects the time war and the alien nature of him as he almost turns into a dalek himself.<br /><br />episode seven: "the long game" - really only a story to act as a prologue for the series finale. saved by simon pegg as the smarmy editor and tamsin grieg in an amusing cameo. the media are controlling us - that's never been done before, has it...<br /><br />episode eight: "father's day" - this is a great episode. full of human emotion and heartache for rose, and the true consequences of what happens when you really muck up history. full marks to billie piper here.<br /><br />episode nine: "the empty child" - i don't find this kid very scary. sorry, but i don't. it's a good episode though, but the cliffhanger still could have been better - it's those "next time" bits that spoil them. john barrowman is introduced here as captain jack, the dashing conman - he's a good actor who's been around for a while but only seemingly noticed now.<br /><br />episode ten: "the doctor dances" - part two of this ww2 story - very well made in historical context terms. a nice upbeat ending, though a little confusing perhaps for younger viewers when the "mummy" is revealed? <br /><br />episode eleven: "boom town"- probably the weakest of the series, but that doesn't mean its bad. a nice return for the slitheen and also an interesting character study of the doctor and rose.<br /><br />episode twelve: "bad wolf" - this starts off quite silly, with some good-hearted humour and cheeky fun making at popular tv shows over her in blighty. things turn deadly serious quickly, though, and the revelation at the end is the best cliffhanger in the series! <br /><br />episode thriteen: "parting of the ways" - goodbye christopher ecclestone. a fantastic doctor in so many ways, david tennant is having to really work his socks off to be as good as him. the regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played. oh, and the daleks are back - in the extreme! god bless cgi, because they'd never be able to pull this off normally! <br /><br />overall - brilliant! 9/10
