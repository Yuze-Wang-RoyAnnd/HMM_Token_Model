a beautiful new print of "zabriskie point" is playing in paris and seems to be doing well in the latin quarter. it's time for a full evaluation of the film. let's hope that the new print means that a dvd with some insightful "extras" will be out in the near future.<br /><br />i remember watching zp when it came out and thought it was a crashing bore. this time around i was totally awed and would classify it as a "near-miss" masterpiece. the first part of the movie is a time capsule of late '60's los angeles, i lived there then, and antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place. kudos to production designer dean tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did outstanding work.<br /><br />the print i saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes. it is forbidden to those under 16 (or 18, i can't remember). i suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print. spoiler -- i wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut. what appears today seems rather tame by current standards.<br /><br />there is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour into the film. before we hear extraneous noise such as radio broadcasts, etc. antonioni was very daring to do this. i remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of non-actors mark frechette and daria halprin. this time frechette did not bother me. halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues.<br /><br />much of the student riot footage looks like stock footage to me. one shot is in a different aspect ratio & distorted by the wide screen. of course, there is actual staged footage, but not all that much.<br /><br />i'm still trying to figure out how antonioni did some of the shots of frechette flying the plane. it looks like he really did some of the flying - there's no blue screen or double in some shots.<br /><br />i hope to get back to see the film a second time. recommended highly to all antonioni fans.
