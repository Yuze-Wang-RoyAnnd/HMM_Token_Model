i loved this movie. in fact i loved being an actress in this movie. iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film. i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector. in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake. thumbs up to full moon high. wish it come to cable soon. cheryl lockett alexander leesville, louisiana i loved this movie. in fact i loved being an actress in this movie. iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film. i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector. in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake. thumbs up to full moon high. wish it come to cable soon. cheryl lockett alexander<br /><br />leesville, louisiana
