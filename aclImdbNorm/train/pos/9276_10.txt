the us state dept. would not like us to see this movie, because they have a beef with the iranian govt. however, it shows us just how civilized iran really is, despite the content of the film, which centers on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest of terms: the ability to watch a soccer game at the stadium, which is strictly limited to male audiences alone. the film is hilariously funny, and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in iran. i enjoyed this movie intensely. five girls try to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between iran and bahrain. the ensuing comedy is too funny to describe, from the bus trip to the stadium, to the interceding of the police and subsequent detention of the girls, to the resulting end. don't miss this classic film. its a must see. one of the best foreign films i've seen in years.
