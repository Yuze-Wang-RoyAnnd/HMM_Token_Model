i first saw this film over 25 years ago on british tv and have only just caught up with it again last week on a dvd copy bought off ebay. i had remembered the musical sequences, the colour and the gorgeous fashion plate poses and clothes but the plot is weaker than the earlier anna neagle/michael wilding film spring in park lane and maytime doesn't stand up so well to the passage of the years. but michael wilding is a joy in the film, charming, funny, debonair, appears to be having great fun and on top of his form. worth watching for him alone. anna neagle appears a little matronly beside him, and a little too old for the part she plays but by the end of the 1940's their film partnership was well established with the cinema going public. spring in park lane had been a top hit for 1947 and a big money maker. in his autobiography wilding wrote at length of his great regard for herbert wilcox the director and instigator of this london series of films.
