this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage. straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks, shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can't help but amuse and entertain. there are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one...danny trejo. and if you don't know who danny trejo is then you probably won't like this film.
