homeward bound is a beautiful film. y'know the part where shadow falls down the ditch... thingy, i *cried*, considering i was only six, i cried! it takes a lot to make me cry! the dogs and the cat are excellently trained. a nice family movie, *not* for completely hardened non-fluffy people or animal-haters but could for soft-as-crap a.k.a. people like me.<br /><br />a good film overall, 10/10!
