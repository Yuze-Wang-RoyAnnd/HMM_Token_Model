this "coming of age" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, dani and maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer.<br /><br />directed by robert mulligan, famous for his superb work in "to kill a mockingbird," the film never hits a false note. all the acting is superb. as dani, reese witherspoon makes a stunning film debut. watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, i felt like i was looking through a window to reality, rather than watching a movie.<br /><br />i have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood. families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together, and use it as a discussion piece, as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc.
