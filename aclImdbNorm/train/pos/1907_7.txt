8 simple rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where paul died which was the first episode i have ever watched of the show that comes on abc. the hennessy clan -- mother cate (katey sagal), daughters bridget (kaley cuoco) and kerry (amy davidson), and son rory (martin spanjers) -- look to one another for guidance and support after the death of paul (john ritter), the family patriarch. cate's parents (james garner and suzanne pleshette) lend a hand. i am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put david spade in this show since he was done with the nbc series, just shoot me! but all and all this show is pretty good. this show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80's and 90's that used to be on abc.
