a kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. extremely well done and polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. personally i could have done without the cross dressing element but i accept the nod to psycho and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the storyline. nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. i can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' frenchman and jewish to boot. still, there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking isabelle adjani and good old shelly winters is as reliable as ever.
