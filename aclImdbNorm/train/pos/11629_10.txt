red eye is a thrilling film by the creator of freddy kreuger, wes craven. wes craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker lisa. after attending the funeral of her grandmother, she decides to take the red eye flight. during waiting, she meets this man named jack rippner, (how fffrreeaakkyy is that?) and they sort of become friends. ironically, both sit right next to each other on this plane. then this is when the horror starts. this movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don't like thrilling/horror films, well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants. this is an excellent example of a bone shaking production. wes craven did well with this film. he chose the right actors, like rachel mcadams, an intelligent, sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is cautious of everything when she's acting in a film. cillian murphy, the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film, and his face can really widen your eyes. wes craven did an excellent job and i hope that he makes more films like this one.
