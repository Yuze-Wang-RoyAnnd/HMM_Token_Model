the cast was good, and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd, whom i like from previous movies. the movie was a great family movie, nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids, a good story line, lots of laughs, lighthearted and enjoyable. if you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill. kid pleasing, and not difficult for a parent to watch, either.
