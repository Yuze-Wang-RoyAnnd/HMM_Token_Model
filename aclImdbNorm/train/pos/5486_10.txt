yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. it's so interesting to see how a world leader (like chavez) who supports the poor people in his country, can be held in such low esteem in the us. his worst "sin", in my opinion, is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel. what can be so bad about that? i have always been fascinated by the us government+media reaction to fidel castro. at first, castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he supplanted batista. soon, however, castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats. we're a decent country, but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor? if these guys are "dictators," then we could use more "dictatorships" especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
