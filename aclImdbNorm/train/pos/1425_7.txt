just like al gore shook us up with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary-movie "an inconvenient truth", directors alastair fothergill and mark linfield also remind us that it's about time to improve our way of life in order to save our beautiful planet. "planet earth" is also a wake-up call that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world. al gore showed us the bleak future of planet earth by presenting hard facts backed up by documented examples through long yet always interesting monologues. the creators of this documentary choose a different yet equally powerful way to accomplish this. they do not present us with a future representation of what might occur to our planet if we don't radically change things around, but they rather show us the genuine beauty of planet earth in all of its amazing glory. we see places that we knew that existed but never thought they could be so beautiful. in this movie, we see a wide array of the most extraordinary places such as forsaken deserts, giant forests full of fauna and flora and icy-landscapes as far as the eye could see. and in all of those immensely different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive.<br /><br />this is exactly the kind of movie that had to be made, in combination with the one from al gore, in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to meddle with. the voice-over by patrick stewart is always relaxing and thus very well done although at first it sounded as though i was watching an x-men movie instead! the cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing of this documentary. at times: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all of that delightful footage.<br /><br />in short: this is definitely a must-see for everyone since it concerns every single person on this beautiful planet earth! the truth is: i never thought our planet was so astonishingly beautiful!
