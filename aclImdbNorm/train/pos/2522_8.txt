i must admit, at first i wasn't expecting anything good, at all. i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting gackt's and hyde's image, but i'm glad to say it has much more to offer.<br /><br />yes, the acting is not that great, but it doesn't suck either, all the cast's well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters. effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough.<br /><br />what really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline, although it merges fantastic elements, it also displays a crude reality. the developing of the characters, their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think that's the key of this movie. it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angst.<br /><br />it fulfills any expectations for a good drama. i would definitely recommend it to everyone.
