another in the they don't make em like that category. this story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean, sometimes over-the-top fun. robert stack and dorothy malone are at their peak as the troubled hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them. malone won an oscar and stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being eminently well-deserved. they counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. it's kind of hard for me to accept rock hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. but that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable. if you're up some night and this movie comes on i'd say watch it. it's well worth it.
