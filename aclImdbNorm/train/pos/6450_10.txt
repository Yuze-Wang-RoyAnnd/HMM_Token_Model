this is absolutely one of the best movies i've ever seen. it takes me on a a roller-coaster of emotions. i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love! all this in a little over two hours of time! <br /><br />the actors are all brilliant! i have to mention the leading actor of course, michael nyquist. he does a remarkable job!! i also admire the actor who plays tore, who plays this mentally-challenged young man in such a convincing way! he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape! and then there is the most beautiful song in the world: gabriella's sang.<br /><br />i recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy!
