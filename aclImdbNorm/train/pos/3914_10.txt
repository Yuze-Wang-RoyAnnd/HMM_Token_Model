personally, i think that the film was done very professionally, i loved the choreography and the acting. the plot is also gripping and mysterious. the film itself is very emotional, and what i liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards. antonio gades has absolutely lived his role to the end, and i must say that it's one of my favourite pictures and saura is a wonderful director.
