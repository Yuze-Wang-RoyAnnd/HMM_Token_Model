i will begin by saying i am very pleased with this climax of the bourne trilogy. please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. just leave it alone. right..moving on.as talented and versatile as matt damon is...it seems as though he was just meant to play jason bourne.<br /><br />if you are a fan of the first two bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. it sticks to what works and adds a little more. i was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'identity' and 'supremacy' all mesh in 'ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of jason bourne's troubled past. the action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the fights between bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. i have always been a fan of movies surrounding cia agents and how the cia gather their intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more exciting for me.<br /><br />if you choose to watch the bourne ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but i would still recommend you watch them first. this would allow you to fully understand the character jason bourne and become attached and be a part of his world. this allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. i'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but i personally think 'ultimatum' might, just might, have the edge when comparing the trilogy.
