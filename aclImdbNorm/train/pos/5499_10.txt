i had no idea of the facts this film presents. as i remember this situation i accepted the information presented then in the media: a confused happening around a dubious personality: mr. chavez. the film is a revelation of many realities, i wonder if something of this caliber has ever been made. i supposed the protagonist was mr.chavez but everyone coming up on picture<br /><br />was important and at the end the reality of that entelechy: the people, was overwhelming. thank you kim bartley and donnacha o'briain.<br /><br />
