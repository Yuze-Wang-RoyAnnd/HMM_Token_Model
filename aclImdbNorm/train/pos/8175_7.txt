before we begin, i have a fear of dentists. this movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe. that is what i love about this film. the movie is kind of boring. for that, i take 3 stars off!<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />the movie revolves around dr. alan feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him. soon, he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients, killing co-workers, and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with.<br /><br />*end spoiler* <br /><br />the movie is very bloody and gory. i would recommend it if you are into gore.<br /><br />i give this film 7 stars out of 10. dr. alan feinstein is not your normal everyday dentist!
