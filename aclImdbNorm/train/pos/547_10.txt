i don't know if i'm just weird, but i thoroughly enjoyed this film. <br /><br />return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake. in fact, i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. i also thought that the cast in this movie was great, judd nelson is always the best! i also enjoyed the plot as a whole. i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of stanley's screenplay cabin by the lake- it wasn't a completely redundant film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them. - if you're looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not the one for you. however, if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch it. i've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film. :)
