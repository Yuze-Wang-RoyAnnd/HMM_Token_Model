a beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism. setting the story around the famous book of kels, believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of iona, off the western coast of scotland.<br /><br />telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of crom-cruic, the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology. in hopes of recovering a lost artefact.<br /><br />the films true beauty lies in its' animation. cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity. deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series 'samurai jack' for its genius use of mark making and background depth, the secret of kels creates a consistently affective celtic world living under the shadow of viking invasion.<br /><br />the history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and celtic-revivalist mysticism. the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is, as she glides from branch to branch. appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary cheshire cat from alice and wonderland.<br /><br />the secret of kels is an absolute treat. for all genders, all ages, it's a lovely piece of family cinema.<br /><br />don't expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed!
