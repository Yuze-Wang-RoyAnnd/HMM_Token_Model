no message. no symbolism. no dark undercurrents.just a wonderful melange of music, nostalgia and good fun put to-gether by people who obviously had a great time doing it. it's a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios. of course anything with the incomparable judi dench is worth watching. and cleo laine's brilliant jazz singing is a bonus. this lady is in the same league as the late ella. this goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime i feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natured chuckle. just a wonderful film!
