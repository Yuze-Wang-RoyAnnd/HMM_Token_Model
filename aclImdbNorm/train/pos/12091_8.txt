`castle of blood' (aka `castle of terror') is a well-crafted, surprisingly spooky entry from italian director anthony dawson. exquisite black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, superb casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though totally appropriate) ending set this one apart. only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between elizabeth (barbara steele) and alan (georges rivi`ere) mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie.<br /><br />while visiting england, edgar allan poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to count blackwood. recognizing the great writer, alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with poe. during the course of the conversation, poe reveals that all of his stories are true. incredulous, alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. count blackwood offers to bet alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in blackwood's castle, a night following halloween when the dead walk. alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.<br /><br />unlike mario bava's overpraised `black sunday,' (aka `the mask of satan'), `castle of blood' is fairly restrained, making the few moments of violence even more dreadful, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible italian space movies from the 60s.<br /><br />it's a pity the only version of this film i've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. even so, it is well worth seeing, and cries out for a modern remake, perhaps with christina ricci or jennifer love hewitt in the role of elizabeth. watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with robert wise's `the haunting'.
