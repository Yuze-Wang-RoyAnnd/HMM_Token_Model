if you have trouble suspending disbelief then this isn't for you. consider: a woman already in late middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and raises it as her own. think about it; she makes no attempt to locate the mother, who may well be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment and seemingly no one from the italian equivalent of social services makes any attempt to put the baby into 'care' (no social services? now i know it's a fantasy). before you know it young toto is ten or so and his adoptive mother dies leaving him to the orphanage from which he emerges a happy man who loves everybody. in nothing flat he has not only given his suitcase to the man who stole it from him but organised the local homeless into bona fide shantytown residents and for an encore he leads them in a fight against capitalism in the shape of the businessman who buys the land on which the shantytown stands when oil is discovered there. this wants some swallowing without the subsequent 'miracles' beginning with toto's dead mother (the old lady who raised him rather than his biological one) appearing to him and handing him a dove which doubles as a magic wand allowing him to grant modest wishes and a finale in which the hobos fly away to a better place located presumably somewhere over the rainbow.<br /><br />on the other hand the film is up to here with charm and is easy to surrender to. on balance a small masterpiece.
