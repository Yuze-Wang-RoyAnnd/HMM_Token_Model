this movie was my first touch with mr sica so i really didn't know what to expect. but what i saw just broke all my expectations - in a good way.<br /><br />the storyline is not complex and shows us a life of found boy- orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate houses. this little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine. but one day there is a water resource found and a rich nobles man is getting interested in the buying the place. but as the title of the movie hints - there is a miracle taking place. our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother. what is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well?<br /><br />it was just a masterpiece of natural comedy. there is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people. also many funny moments and scenes are included - at the beginning with the spot where sun is shining and many more.<br /><br />so according to the fact that i m not a comedy lover you should see this movie because i liked it much <br /><br />i
