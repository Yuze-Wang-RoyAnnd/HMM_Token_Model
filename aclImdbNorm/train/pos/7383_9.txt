extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of s~ao paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in brazilian urbania. for the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film, it has the grit of mexican feature "amores perros" with a character not too far off max cady, from both cape fears, although this is not, by any means, a film about a psychopath. two partners (alexandre borges and marco ricca) in a construction company pay hitman anisio (miklos) to off their third partner (and majority share holder) in said construction outfit. the murder is blamed on the city, but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime, not only trespassing but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes that make up brazilian society. anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in. the look is almost entirely handheld, grainy, the performances outstanding throughout, especially so as first time actor (and member of classic brazilian pop band 'tit~as'), paulo miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror.<br /><br />i saw the film at the bras'ilia film fest in november 2001. it has since done very well in sundance and berlin. kleber mendonca filho
