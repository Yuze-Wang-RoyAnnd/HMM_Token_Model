say what you want about andy milligan - but if his family was even 10% as deranged as the one in this film, well then i guess he could have turned out worse. unfortunately, the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture's box office appeal. several times during the film milligan's ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends, and suddenly good-looking stand-ins for milligan's homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60's guitar rock. it's pretty easy to fast-forward through if you're trying to pay attention to milligan's original film, which, unfortunately, is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes. what remains, however, is still compelling stuff. i don't think i've ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before.
