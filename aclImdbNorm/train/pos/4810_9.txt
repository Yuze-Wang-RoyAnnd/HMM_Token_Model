just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty couldn't go anywhere, we are given a treat, a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by emily blunt, a marvel in the leading role, paul bettany, rupert friend, miranda richardson, and mark strong, as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of england's most powerful monarchs. "the young victoria" dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power.<br /><br />emily plays the queen, with a good combination of raw strength and innocence, someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand, but who possesses enough confidence to move forward. she is able to portray victoria, as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand.<br /><br />victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown, and even when she takes command of her new position, she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course, the right support. luckily for victoria, there is albert, a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate. there is amazing chemistry between the two performers, and there's little doubt what the outcome will be, but there is the figure of bettany's prime minister, a man who provides victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her.<br /><br />miranda richardson and mark strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl. every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development, but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by blunt, an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances. in here, she is given the breakout role of her career, a real life historical figure, who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time. she shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years. she also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes.<br /><br />"the young victoria" is not a royal epic portrayal of england's ruling class. it is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them. in the end, the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction. in here, there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far, and there is of course, a good old fashioned love story.
