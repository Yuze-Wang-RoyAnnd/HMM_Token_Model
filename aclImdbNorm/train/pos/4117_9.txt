"d^o desu ka den" is the first colored movie of master akira kurosawa, and surprisingly is not about samurais, ronins, warlords or battlefields. it is inside a very poor community in a slum in tokyo, where the dwellers are homeless drunkards, beggars, tramps, abused women, losers. i do not know the reason why kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors, but indeed they are very sad stories, some of them heart-breaking. i personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them; the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train; the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather. my vote is nine.<br /><br />title (brazil): "dodeskaden
