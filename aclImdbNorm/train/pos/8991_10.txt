dig! is funny, fun, amusing, interesting, stylish, and very well done. knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told, especially with such style and substance. if you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see.<br /><br />focusing on the brian jonestown masssacre and the dandy warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a genius megalomaniacal lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol, and insanity. if i did not know that this is footage of real people, i would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece. the story is compelling, concise, and simply amazing.
