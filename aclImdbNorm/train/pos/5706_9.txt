had this movie been made just a few years later, i would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor. at times, the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in-between-scenes (normal ambient sounds are missing). but, given it was 1931 and a french movie, this is quite forgivable. especially since this also occurs in later french films--by which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely (such as in l'atalante from 1934).<br /><br />okay, apart from some minor sound problems, this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. and, during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you can't help but like. a nice charming film all-in-all.
