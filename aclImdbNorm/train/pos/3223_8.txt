ok, basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence. you can count about 10 clich'es that the film is building up to, but it only delivers on about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot. kurt russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding. recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!
