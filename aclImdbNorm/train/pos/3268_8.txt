a charming romantic comedy. the plot is a little too complicated--i tried to summarize it three times and i can't. suffice to say it's worth seeing. the movie is funny, beautiful--the plot is totally unrealistic but it works. everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great--it creates a sweet, romantic feel through the entire film. <br /><br />the acting is great--robert downey jr. and cybill shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it. ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson are just ok but fine. if you're a sucker for good, sweet sentimental films (like me), catch this one. also downey looks great in his underwear!<br /><br />extra bonuses--the title song sung by johnny mathis and another great song "after all" sung by cher and peter cetera.
