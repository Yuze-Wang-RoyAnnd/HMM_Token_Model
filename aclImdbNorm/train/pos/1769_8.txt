just came out of a sneak preview for this film. it had me laughing every 30 secs. the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadn't bought that large coke. there are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in "bruce almighty" and will ferrell "anchorman: the legend of ron burgendy" in their movies. paul rudd is hilarious as always. i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like p.s.). i think that seth rogen should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging. leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments. i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. however, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. if you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. and, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those "hip" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them. it would make for some incredibly awkward moments.
