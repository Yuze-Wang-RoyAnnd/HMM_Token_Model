james dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. when one reads "deliverance", one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the deep south. when one watches john boorman's film version of the book, one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book. the camera is as descriptive as the narration. the characters are fully realized, and the portrayals are fantastic. i first saw this movie in 1992, after my freshman year of college. i was in a phase where i was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973. among them were "patton", "papillon", and "all the president's men"; fine films, all of them. this one was easily the class of the group. that says a lot.
