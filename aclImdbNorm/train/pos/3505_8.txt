i have no idea how imdb sorts reviews but i do know that, as happens often on amazon.com, there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same, somewhat obscure talking points, almost verbatim. a campaign? only imdb knows.<br /><br />as for this movie: it's fine. it's a funny, cute and very straightforward movie.<br /><br />it's been over a decade since i worked in brooklyn, lived in queens and visited relatives in the south bronx. but i found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids. is the grandmother a bizarre character? yup. do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this? yes, thankfully, they do. are other movies set in the les and featuring dominican / puerto rican kids possible? you betcha. does that make this movie a crime
