i saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, i thought the film gave a good soldiers point of view, it gave a realistic account, of men at war. the storyline moves at a nice pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. the characters are well developed, and believable.<br /><br />david hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role with conviction, as does alan dobie (as german helmut) i was surprised, that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd, and i feel it has become the forgotten film, which is sad , as it is superior to many other war films i have seen.
