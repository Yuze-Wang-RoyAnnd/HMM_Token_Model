do you like really inventive comedy or do you love "the wedding crashers", if the answer is the latter stop reading now. i can't believe this movie is not higher rated. basically meadows plays a character not unlike austin powers.there are so many inventive moments in this gagorama. from crudity - leon playing with himself on the porch, the ex boyfriend tricked into eating . . oh well. to inspired lunacy- clown sex , the broadway routine, the voice over. meadows is great as the childish, but very sweet natured leon. some great lines "don't blame the wang" "freaky deaky sex world" too many. . . why this movie wasn't huge is a mystery. great comedy.
