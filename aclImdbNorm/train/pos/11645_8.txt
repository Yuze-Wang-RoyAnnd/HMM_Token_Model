i was on france, around march 05, and i love to go to this film festivals. i knew about this cin'emas d'am'erique latine de toulouse, but i've never went to it. i decided to go and then i caught cero y van 4. <br /><br />the film is stunning. it doesn't caused the impact on me like with the mexican users, because it was french-subtitled but it's still shocking.<br /><br />this film is a satire about urban violence, about kidnapping and crime on the streets in mexico. it is a crude portrait of the city. of a metropolis. secuestro express, with a stunning mia maestro, which was also a satire of kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone has, and i think so, some kinda connection with cero y van 4. a, sort of, redemption story and that how much is too much? man on fire, that was stunningly strong, was also, not a satire, but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico. or it is like the brave one. a film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard. this is like the usual suspects, it has some plot twists and turns, but that makes it even more believable. verdict: a film that shocks and makes you believe that there's no security on the streets anymore. stunning dialogue, impressive direction and astonishing performances. cero y van 4 is a film that you won't forget soon. leaves you shaking and stunned.
