as someone who has never condescended adam sandler in terms of talent, as is done to him and many comic actors like him, i walked in to reign over me expecting a great film, not simply because of his presence in the movie but because i thought that it looked very good overall. even someone who already thought that sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that i was surprised at how fantastic he is in it. he will make you weep, especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue. what's amazing about his role is that it's a character it's hard to say we've seen before. we've seen many emotionally scarred characters, many mentally retarded people, many loners, many passionate self-centered artists, but sandler's charlie fineman is none of these. he may have a taste of each of them in some ways, but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual. it's a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems, mindset, and provocations are completely different from most characters like him.<br /><br />don cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level. he is every man. he is the most normal possible person in the world, so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either, or at least any that are played the way he plays alan johnson, whose name is even found on the assembly line. cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny, jolting, smart, and stupid the way so many normal people are.<br /><br />the rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who've hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles. jada pinkett-smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife, donald sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge, robert klein is sandler's desensitized father-in-law.<br /><br />mike binder's script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises. it's much more subtle than, say, babel, and has a much more close-to-home ideal.<br /><br />the camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style. this film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen-sink style of the 1970s. cinematography was grainy and unfastened, but that was its charm. it wasn't about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would've diluted its stories with such.<br /><br />the music, which plays a major role in the film, and its title, is very powerful. near the beginning, you feel like you're in for another about schmidt or little miss sunshine sort of soundtrack, but you soon realize you're in for more than that. in fact, the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes.<br /><br />reign over me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself. it goes to show that even the director of blankman is capable of wonders.
