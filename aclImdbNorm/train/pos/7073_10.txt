one of the greatest film i have seen this year.last maybe before sun rise, which is also seen late at night alone in the lab. i like the idea of the film,which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate.with time past by james and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes. i do like the end. but a big question also comes. the virus shall not be released again, should it?<br /><br />in the last scene in the airport. jose is sent back to meet james again by future scientists. when he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus. and they two together meet kathryn when kathryn tell james the true man is dr. goines assistant. so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virus,(james keep an eye on him at the time remember?) and he has teeth. so why everything is still happen?? why future scientists don't do anything after the truth is revealed?? my biggest question after the film...
