i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film. if you sit close to the screen, you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures. the detail, colors, and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than toy story. how they were able to pull off the shading, i will never know. i do hope that pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished. based on this film, i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film.
