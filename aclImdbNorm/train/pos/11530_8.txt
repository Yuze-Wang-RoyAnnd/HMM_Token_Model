a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck."mirage" is obviously inspired by spielberg's "duel" and craven's "the hills have eyes".still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.the film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.there is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.the acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak,but the film is fast-paced and shocking.b.g.steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.the desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.overall,if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10.
