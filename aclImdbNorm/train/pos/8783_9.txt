gentleman jim not really a boxing film. it is a vehicle for errol flynn as jim corbett. but having said that, the boxing scenes are a real eye-opener to the modern viewer. there are no 12 round, points decisions here.<br /><br />errol flynn plays the irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title. flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable corbett. his opponent john sullivan is still better however, a bruiser of the old school played by ward bond.<br /><br />the theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance. corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as gentleman jim. jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment. he is a liar and an egotist. sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character.<br /><br />there is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all. and errol flynn gets the girl.
