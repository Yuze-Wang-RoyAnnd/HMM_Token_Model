i think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of tom cruise's weird movies (magnolia, eyes wide shut) but vanilla sky is definitely its own movie. many people said it was weird; it wasn't. it was different and confusing but not weird. weird is stanley kubrick or pauly shore. different is the truman show. confusing is the matrix or the game. and unlike kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. everything makes sense -- maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. vanilla sky is confusing because david aames (tom cruise) is confused. that's the point. that's where the so-called "weirdness" that turned critics away came in. if they had bothered to "open [their] eyes" as the original 1997 spanish movie, they would have seen that. and if that's not enough reason to see it, go see it for the music. cameron crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to set the "feel" -- that notorious element that many movies lack. with songs like the beach boys' "good vibrations" playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie, he creates an offbeat, yet astoundingly "right" feel. a wonderful film, in its script, music, acting, and images, vanilla sky is sadly, a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent. excellent: a+
