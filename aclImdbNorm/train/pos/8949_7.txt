vertigo co-stars stewart (in his last turn as a romantic lead) and novak elevate this, stewart's other "christmas movie," movie to above mid-level entertainment. the chemistry between the two stars makes for a fairly moving experience and further revelation can be gleaned from the movie if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that hampers many people's relationships. all in all, a nice diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.
