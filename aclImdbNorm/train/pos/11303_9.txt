visconti's first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique, accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and, best of all, clara calamai as the fabulous, frantic giovanna. remade several times as 'the postman rings twice' but never bettered. can't believe this was the man's first film! it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career.
