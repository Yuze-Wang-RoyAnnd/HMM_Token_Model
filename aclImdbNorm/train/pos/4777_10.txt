perhaps the most personal of david lynch's works is his most accessible. this time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares, lynch provides a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. the simple true story of an iowa farmer (richard farnsworth) who rides a lawn mower to wisconsin to visit his estranged, stricken brother, there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes (some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland, filmed by veteran cinematographer freddy francis) to make it an undeniable lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable. farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and sissy spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter (whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by john roach and mary sweeney) but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances, one of the most notable being barbara robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time. but that's vintage lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best. to those unfamiliar with lynch or know him only by his violent, disturbing reputation, this is an excellent place to begin; for those who know his work, this is one of the finest in his repertoire.
