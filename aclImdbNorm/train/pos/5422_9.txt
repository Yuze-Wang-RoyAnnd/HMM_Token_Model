the story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands, is told in the 1939 film "gunga din." based loosely on the rudyard kipling poem, the film is brilliantly directed by george stevens and stars cary grant, douglas fairbanks jr. and victor mclagen. the title role is played by sam jaffe, well known in my era as ben casey's boss, dr. zorba, a name that became synonymous with big, out of control hair. say "dr. zorba hair" to anyone of my generation, and they know what you're talking about.<br /><br />set in india at the time of the british occupation, three soldiers - two romantic, dashing figures in grant and fairbanks, and mclagen as a big lug - are cut-ups - in reality, three overgrown boys. gunga din is the water carrier, treated somewhat meanly - verbally, anyway - by mcchesney (mclaglen), but cutter (grant) is fond of him. when he catches din (pronounced deen) practicing being his soldier walk and salute as he apes the unit during their maneuvers, cutter gives him a few pointers.<br /><br />the merry band of musketeers is going to break up when ballantine (fairbanks) announces he's about to be married to a lovely young woman (joan fontaine) and leaving the service. however, when gunga din and cutter run across thugees, a murderous cult led by a guru (eduardo cianelli), gunga din escapes to warn the unit, and ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save cutter. it's a buddy movie after all.<br /><br />"gunga din" starts out lightheartedly, with slapstick and wonderful, broad comedy, particularly by cary grant, who is quite funny. both he and fairbanks are so handsome, it's hard to decide which one to look at first. much of the film is made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting. in the last part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense, thrilling battle.<br /><br />grant has the showiest role, fairbanks is the lovesick romantic, and mclaglen as mcchesney, mostly due to his treatment of gunga din, is the most unlikeable character, although one detects his soft heart in his love for his elephant annie. his softness comes through toward the end of the movie, particularly in the very touching, tear-jerking final scene.<br /><br />always a gentle and likable actor, sam jaffe gives a beautiful performance as gunga din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and lofty dreams. without much dialogue, jaffe conveys gunga din's soul magnificently.<br /><br />this is truly the ultimate adventure film, massive in scope, with good acting, rousing scenes, a wonderful musical score, and some beautiful cinematic images. another one from that remarkable year, 1939. highly recommended.
