this is an excellent, heartbreaking movie. it is by far the best i've seen that depicts the current reality in latin america...kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless mayhem towards innocent victims. denzel washinton gives the most moving performance in his career, in my opinion. dakota fanning is an amazing young actress. the relationship between washington and fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, i believed every minute. the cast is brilliant, christopher walken, mickey rourke are great as always. walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor. i would have loved to see more of both of them. the authentic locations are remarkable. the camera work is interesting and different. there are many famous latin actors in the cast, making it all the more interesting for people familiar with latin american cinema. i highly recommend this movie.
