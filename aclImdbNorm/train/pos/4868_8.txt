i gave this film 8 out of 10, reserving 10 for e.g amadeus, and 9 for slumdog millionaire most recently. this film is close to slumdog, but it is difficult to judge on such film without understanding balkan life, mentality and a soul which kusturica presents masterfully. to understand it you really need to be one of balkan. this is an amazing movie, much better and more contemporary of his previous films, which are boring at this time, i think kusturica is moving forward with this movie. i like humour (balkan humour), photography is an art itself, each scene is artistic to the limit. plot is probably a fairy tale , don't recall it now, but remember reading to my daughter-going-to sleep a similar story.
