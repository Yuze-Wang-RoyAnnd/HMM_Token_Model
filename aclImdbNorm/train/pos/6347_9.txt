how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing. now, eight viewings later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw it.<br /><br />screenwriters jeffery price & peter s. seaman of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen. ron howard's direction brought the story to full life, and jim carrey's typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the show.<br /><br />some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story. having read the original story, i must say i cannot agree. the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story. indeed, it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he was.<br /><br />*mild spoilers* (they probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until you've seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.)<br /><br />i think just about everyone can relate to the grinch's terrible experiences in school. i think all of us, at one time or another, were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on. i know i was... and that's why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went through.<br /><br />and cindy lou who's naive idealism, believing that nobody can be all bad, was heart rending. when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance, cindy lou was determined to be his friend. if only everyone could have such an attitude.<br /><br />in fact, i think the only thing that might've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content. it was already pretty restrained, but any of this adult humor (like when the grinch slammed nose first into martha may whovier's cleavage) just doesn't fit in a story like this.<br /><br />this one's well on its way to being a christmas classic, taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a must-see of every christmas season.
