this movie kept me constantly entertained. in comparing this to serial mom, mr. waters has gone back to his grittier side. this is not nearly as polished.<br /><br />there is a dark side here. a message about how success and fame changes a person -- but more importantly how it changes the people around you.<br /><br />there is not a false moment in this film.<br /><br />the characters are somewhat cartoonish... but i want to believe that is what mr. waters is trying to achieve.<br /><br />it is fascinating to watch how mr. waters has evolved... this is truly his finest work.
