this is one of the best of the series, ranking up there with resident evil 3: nemesis (or biohazard: last escape) the game has a very good storyline in which you play as claire redfield in the search for her brother,chris redfield (whom you probably know from the original resident evil) it is as scary as the other resident evil, and contains alot more cutscenes.<br /><br />my rating: **** out of ***** stars (rating based on comparison to other videogames)
