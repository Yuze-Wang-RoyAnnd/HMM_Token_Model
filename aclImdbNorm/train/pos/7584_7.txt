this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say, "enough already!" of course, it isn't nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes. eric phillips (don wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to eric to clear her name. wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me. being a pm production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don's simulator. it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa 1995.
