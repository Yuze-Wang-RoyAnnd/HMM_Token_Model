my take: a goofy, yet imaginative mess. <br /><br />keanu reeves (yes! that keanu reeves) and alex winter return as the two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the time-trotting adventure comedy bill and ted's excellent adventure, now a cult classic. in this sequel, bill and ted are given much more to do than travel through time. they might as well travel heaven and hell too! during the beginning of this sequel, bill and ted are preparing for a "battle of the bands" competition which may make them more famous than ever. meanwhile, many years in a futuristic civilization, the time-wizard from the first film (the always watchable george carlin) is running a university praising bill and ted's names. there, an evil tyrant (joss ackland, from the hunt for red october) plots to get rid of the two idiot rock-stars once and for all. so he sends two identical android replicas (in the words of bill and ted: robot us's) to do the dirty job.<br /><br />there after, bill and ted experience death and must find their way through hell, with inhabitants that happens to include the duo's worst memories, and then through heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends... and their show. along this whacked-out voyage, they play board games with none other than death (william sadler, from die hard 2), reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic the seventh seal, aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more.<br /><br />bogus journey's array of exuberant special effects gimmicks aren't up to to-date standards, and even some of the humor and the for-the-time look and feel are somewhat dated (to be honest, the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year, even for the 90's). but with it's no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction, bill and ted's bogus journey is fun, imaginative, and yes, bogus.<br /><br />rating: ***1/2 out of 5.
