one of my all time favourite films, ever. just beautiful, full of human emotion, wit, humour, intelligence. the story grows, as does the lesson of life, just a wonderful film in so many ways.<br /><br />the cast are also fantasic..... a great selection of the finest british talent around. i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film.<br /><br />italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this, - everything about this film works.<br /><br /> i love it :)
