i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do. a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of paperback lore. it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day. this shouldn't keep the viewer from giving it a whirl. wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed. sure, it might bite from certain elements of romancing the stone, and indiana jones. but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar. i am surprised not too many people know about it. it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in '86. i watched it back then on cable tv. it might be hard to find since it's out of print on both vhs and dvd. i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than 8 bucks! cool flick.
