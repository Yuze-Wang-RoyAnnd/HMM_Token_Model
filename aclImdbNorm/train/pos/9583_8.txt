i waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when i first saw it over 10 years ago, i wanted to think carefully about what i wanted to write. <br /><br />i found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary. it did what it set out to do, show me something i had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored. i knew nothing of the drag world and finding out about them and the "balls" was just spectacular to me. these folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it, for competition. the catty folks, the complainers (even i was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen was wearing wasn't a man's coat!), the jealous, it's all there like in every other competition. like every other competition like it. which i felt was a point.<br /><br />you had the older drag queen talking about how the balls "used" to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories -- and even those who looked on knowing that the future of balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway. it was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete, it was that important to them! then there was sad stories, stories of who's "house" and "house mother" brought out the best and the brightest in competition. it was interesting.<br /><br />now to add after 10 years of seeing this film, i lived through the so called 'madonna' craze. i spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with madonna during her "vogue" phase and rightfully so. if not for those individuals, madonna wouldn't have had a "vogue" phase, i know that now. credit should be given where credit is due. makes me wonder, if anyone else from mainstream america would watch this documentary, they'll learn they're not as "mainstream" as they think.
