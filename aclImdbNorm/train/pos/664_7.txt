tales from the crypt: and all through the house starts on christmas eve as elizabeth (mary ellen trainor) kills her husband joseph (marshall bell), she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac (larry drake) dressed as santa clause has escaped from a local mental asylum & has already killed several women with elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas & tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage...<br /><br />this tales from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1, directed by the one of the show's regular executive producers robert zemeckis and all through the house is a decent enough watch. the script by fred dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic 'the vault of horror' & was originally adapted to film as one episode from the britsih horror anthology film tales from the crypt (1972) which starred joan collins as the murderous wife character here played by ellen trainor. this particular version is good enough but doesn't do anything different or special & is a bit too linear & predictable to be considered a classic. at only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace, the story is just about macabre enough & it generally provides decent entertainment & i quite liked the downbeat ending. this time there are christmas themed opening & closing crypt keeper (john kassir) segments complete with the usual puns.<br /><br />director zemeckis does a good job & there's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well. there's not much gore here, someone has a poker stuck in their head, someone's face is cut with an icicle, someone's arm is cut with an axe & there's some blood splatter but generally speaking it's not that graphic. the acting by a small cast is pretty good.<br /><br />and all through the house isn't the best tale from the crypt but it's a decent one all the same, worth a watch but after the comic book story & original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this?
