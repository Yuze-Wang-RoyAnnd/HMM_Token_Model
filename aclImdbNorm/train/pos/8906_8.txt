some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something: dvd menu system. i tell you the people, i watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times. it was awesome. a cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was, which was the very beginning. many times the sum and bam! i was hooked. over and over and over. and over.<br /><br />"doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." and that's just the soundtrack! <br /><br />i is laid aside in the bed, curled up with my vaio. the rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft. the cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses in me, is already rested. i popped in the dvd. i was mesmerized. through the night. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo."<br /><br />the blob. see it. steve queen, two cops, and one girl in a dress. two thumbs way up!
