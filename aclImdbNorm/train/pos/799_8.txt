he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; in this case, portraying attorney (and murderer) tom capano.<br /><br />kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim, anne marie fahey, but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim. we are sorry for the situation, but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women (including rachel ward) as well.<br /><br />the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues, and capano actually had her psychologist killed. pretty hard to believe, but this was based on a true story.<br /><br />there is a cameo with olympia dukakis (excellent) as capano's mother. all in all, an interesting story because it is based on a true murder, and you will want to read ann rule's book to get the accurate details. 8/10.
