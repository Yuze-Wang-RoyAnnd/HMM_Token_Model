spoiler alert!!!!<br /><br />i had just watched the extended version of bedknobs and broomsticks. though i did like the extended version, i wish they would have left the original version on the dvd.<br /><br />the portabello road could have been cut down to the orginal length. it was too long and dragged the movie along. though the dancing is great, would have been much better left on the dvd as a deleted scene.<br /><br />all in all this is a great movie. my 5 year old liked it. and it is wonderful that movies that i enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation. this and mary poppins are added to my collection.<br /><br />just as i had remembered!<br /><br />*** out of ****<br /><br />
