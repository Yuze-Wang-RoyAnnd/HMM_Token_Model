a young solicitor in sent to a remote area to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased client. when he arrives he finds that he is made less than welcome by the local villagers and that his deceased client was not liked. to speed things up he decides to move from the local inn and take up residence in her home, a house that is usually fogbound and approached only by a causeway that is blocked off by the sea most of the day. once there he sees visions of a woman in black, is she real or imaginary,he is also subjected to the blood curdling cries of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marshes, these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes quite terrified. atmospheric tv adaptation of a famous play by susan hill, that spends it first third building up its characters, before moving to the creepy country house, its poor colour contrast give away its tv roots immediately, this really should have been in black & white, but still as a ghost story it had a couple of unsettling moments, still though after waiting so long to see it i must say i was sadly just a little underwhelmed.
