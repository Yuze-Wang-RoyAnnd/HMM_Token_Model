though i liked on the town better i really liked it. i'm a new comer when it comes to frank sinatra and gene kelly. though i had heard of them i had never seen anything with them in it until recently. the first one i saw was singin in the rain that made me a fan of gene's. i think that is better too. but i thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's an awesome movie and i love it. frank and gene make a good team. i have yet to see them together in take me out to the ballgame. but i'm sticking to my guns bu saying that i really enjoyed it, and that i love it!
