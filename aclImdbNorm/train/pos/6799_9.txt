this episode is a bit confusing. some people say that you have to start from the very beginning but i have to say i was a bit confused from the beginning!<br /><br />clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of fairview mental institution and is made fun of for believing that he's a superhero. clark is told that the life that he knew was all in his head. delusional. he also find some things that are unusual: martha's married to lionel; lex is bound to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge; and lana is devoted to clark. but he finds one familiarity; someone else who's devoted to clark: chloe. he also finds that a mental patient is also from the known world of smallville. and the doctor is an escapee from the phantom zone.<br /><br />this episode reminds me right back to a buffy episode called "normal again" where buffy begins to have vivid-daydreams about a mental asylum. the doctor tried to convince her that all that she knew was a figment of her imagination and that she was, in fact, crazy. her parents were still married, they still lived in la, her friends didn't exist, angel was never her boyfriend and she didn't have a sister called dawn. demons and vampires also didn't exist. both episodes are a bit sad because doctors aren't just telling the characters that it's all a figment of her imagination but it tells us what it really is: fiction, and it brings us back to reality. it's nice, though, to have a sense of reality every once in a while, but we watch these shows to escape from reality. it's again nice because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
