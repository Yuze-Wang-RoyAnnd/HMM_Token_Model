trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract audience. they are, of course showing the main message of the movie:<br /><br />people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives, using power, which they may have somewhere else, to notoriously oppress others. and at the low end of the oppression chain, mostly women.<br /><br />a movie showing this as brutally as hundstage is surely tough to face, but having to endure such lives, is even tougher.<br /><br />technically the film is much like short cuts, but consisting of documentary style episodes, featuring people like your neighbour, playing just the way they are. without any glitter, and most disturbingly, without any hope. its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing, because you realize, such people are out there, and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks. somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to shatter. i sure do know such people.<br /><br />if you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny, but this happens for real) and without any melodramatic, go watch this movie. however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear, as subtitles can't transport accentuation.
