the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. director john "bud" cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger, crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds. moreover, cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder. the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus: jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams, dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana, christopher mitchum as the concerned richard, marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth, natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny, and scott c. kolden as the gutsy steve. the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures, neat stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a scrawny lizard dude), and nifty matte paintings. richard band's rousing full-bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot. john arthur morrill's crisp, sunny cinematography likewise does the trick. a fun flick.
