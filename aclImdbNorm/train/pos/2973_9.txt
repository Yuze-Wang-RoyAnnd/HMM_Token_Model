here is one movie that is genuinely funny at every single moment that it covers. how can it not be given that this movie stars the creators of south park and is directed by david zucker? when i first saw this movie, i did'nt immediately realise that coop and doug were really matt and trey but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive. i was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really matt and trey, later on. the humor is sometimes crude, sometimes foul, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but overall, this is one hell of a movie that is without doubt, under rated. well actually, its insane. totally insane.
