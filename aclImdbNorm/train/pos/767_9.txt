being that i am a true product of the hip-hop and electronic dance music generation, this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. beat street, although not as "authentic" in some respects as wild style, is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample/dj-based music and electro-club culture.<br /><br />although i will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy, you can't help but feel for the characters, and ultimately "wish you were there" for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in new york city in the early eighties. the b-boy battle scene at the roxy nightclub (a real-life, real-time competition between the legendary rock steady crew and the nyc breakers) is just as essential to a hip-hop fan's archives as any classic album. watch some of the breakers' moves in slow-motion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned b-boy/b-girl. all praises due to the zulu nation!!!
