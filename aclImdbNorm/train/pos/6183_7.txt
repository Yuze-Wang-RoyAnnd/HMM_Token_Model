financially strapped paramount pulled out all the stops for this '34 stage adaptation entry: big budget, large cast, extravagant production and mitch leisen tagged as the director. what happened? two things: busby berkeley didn't work for the out-of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst charlie chan first draft down the street. i have to believe that the cutting was out of leisen's hands since the great duke ellington's number is savagely chopped, but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look: the 'sweet marihuana' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower, considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing (whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied jack oakie. carl brisson's acting is bland as melba toast but he's a competent singer. maclaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective. and try to spot lucy in the chorus. this rates a 7.0 as a curiosity. feb 2010 re-think: i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was wrong to berate the lack of busby berkeley production numbers. i can understand leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. i still have enormous issues with the editing however. paramount, the raciest major studio in town, faced huge issues with the production code at the worst possible time in it's history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this one (also check out 1934's search for beauty). a must see for pre-code buffs.
