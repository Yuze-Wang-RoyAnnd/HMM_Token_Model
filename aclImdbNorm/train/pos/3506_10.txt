peter sollett has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the lower east side of new york, or loisaida, as it's known by the locals.<br /><br />mr. sollett's heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family, that is typical of the different 'inner cities' of the country. mr. sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents. these are basically good kids, the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing. <br /><br />instead of presenting his characters as losers, mr. sollett shows a positive side they all have. these kids are not into drugs, or are stealing because they are poor. had this story been done by hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes, instead of children that are struggling, but deep down inside, they are not defeated.<br /><br />victor rasuk, as victor vargas, was a revelation. he is a natural. so is july marte. her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she doesn't want to do. altagracia guzman, as the grandmother is excellent. she conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her. <br /><br />all in all, this was an excellent picture thanks to peter sollett.
