first time i saw this movie was in the eighties, but reviewed now this thriller is still actual. some newer movies focus on similar topics, but they do not match this french milestone.<br /><br />a president - obviously jf kennedy - gets shot in an open car during a public appearance. the resulting huge investigation finds the "lee harvey oswald" figure of this movie guilty, but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry. he reveals some surprising evidence ...<br /><br />unlike oliver stone's jfk - a movie with the same plot - this one does not play with emotions, but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together, drawing a new picture of the assassination. even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. compared to jfk this movie is more reasonable, intelligent and thrilling. parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies, i had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema.<br /><br />"i... comme icare" is a "must see". its unique and brilliant, and the music by ennio morricone is wonderful. this movie deserves a very good ranking, if it was a hollywood production it would be famous for sure.<br /><br />
