the movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father.<br /><br />the brilliant dialog, lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that keeps peeling back layers.<br /><br />the core issues of parenting, communication and manhood are explored indirectly.<br /><br />in fun ways the curtain is pulled back, the masks slip off a little and truths are exposed.<br /><br />all of this happens amidst a road trip format. the backdrop is rural new york state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors. wow!
