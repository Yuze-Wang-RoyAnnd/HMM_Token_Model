do not judge this production by the 2-hour version that was released on vhs in the us, which is a choppy and incomprehensible mess. i had the pleasure of watching the full-length 6-hour version available on dvd from the uk, and was spellbound. the deliberate pace and growing sense of menace are mesmerizing, as is the amazing visual and aural landscape; this is an ancient rome we have never seen before, and far more authentic than most.<br /><br />director franco rossi was justly celebrated for his 1968 mini-series of the odyssey, and this mini-series is equally powerful. just as bekim fehmiu became the screen's best ulysses, so klaus maria brandauer may be the screen's best nero. now, i am hoping someday to see rossi's version of the aeneid (eneide) that was broadcast on italian tv in 1971.<br /><br />i am undecided which version of quo vadis is more powerful, this one or the polish mini-series from 2001; each has different virtues, and in many ways they complement one another. certainly, either one towers over that hollywood camp-riot starring peter ustinov.
