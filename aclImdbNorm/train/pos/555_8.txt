my comment would have been added to the release date section, but i couldn't find a place for it. i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the u.s. in feb., 1955. i saw it in a "first run" theater in washington, d.c. in march, 1958. wonder if it was re-released, or some problem? in my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment, but has some classic characters. john mcintyre does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge/entrepreneur/thief. walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier. and, in my opinion, james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did. i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more, and never tire of seeing parts of it again. the photography and scenery are splendid, and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.
