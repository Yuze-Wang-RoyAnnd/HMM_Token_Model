crush provides a combination of drama, humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart. mostly known for directing john mckay wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty-something friends in a small town in england. all three professional women down-out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin, fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos. andie macdowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the british (which is where i find she exudes the most) is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man. small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends (great supporting cast) conflicts with her relationship. unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness. keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that. this is the type of film you either love or hate, which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released. as i'm sure most are just unearthing the film now. i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as "love actually", and "three weddings and a funeral". not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments.
