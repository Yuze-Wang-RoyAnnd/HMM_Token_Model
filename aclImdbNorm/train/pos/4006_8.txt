[warning: contains spoilers]<br /><br />i have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uneasy. she came to mind when i reflected on the audience's reaction to "the mother." <br /><br />people gasped when may (anne reid) writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover, darren (daniel craig) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by may. i doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex.<br /><br />screenwriter hanif kureishi ("my beautiful laundrette," "my son the fanatic") again proves why he's among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the atlantic. his story's not easy to take. this searing family drama isn't a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it's raw, complex, and often makes us very uncomfortable. nevertheless, it's powerfully good stuff.<br /><br />kureishi and roger michell (who directed "notting hill," of all things) craft an unsentimental, wrenching and superbly-acted portrait of an older woman who realizes, after all these years, she can and should still enjoy all of life's pleasures. in a wonderfully epiphanous moment, when her son, bobby, asks her not to be difficult, may shoots back, "why not?"<br /><br />why not, indeed.<br /><br />anne reid deserves an oscar nomination for her turn as may. it's subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. watch reid when may observes darren and paula (cathryn bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub. or, when she begs paula to open the front door after a disastrous date. reid's eyes and face reveal all of may's anguish and despair. in the film's most devastating moment, may drops to her knees before darren, willing to do anything for him, only asking him to be kind. this is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress.<br /><br />i enjoyed michell's use of natural sound, especially when may and toots first arrive at bobby's place. it perfectly illustrated the cacophony around may and toots, the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them.<br /><br />this film, at times, reminded me of the honesty and rawness of mike leigh's work, except "the mother" hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat.<br /><br />my one quibble: michell's decision to give may and darren's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility. the lovers remain out of focus while, in the foreground, a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze. and the only sound is of may in the throes of passion.<br /><br />the problem with michell's approach is that both reid and craig, who completely envelops the role of darren, plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it's unfair to hide their characters' almost primitive energy from the audience. especially since michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral.<br /><br />this film doesn't have immensely likable characters. we sympathize with may, but she, too, causes her daughter's suffering. but i doubt kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk. his point, i believe, was to unmask a family that's already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens. it's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable.
