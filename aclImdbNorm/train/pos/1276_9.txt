i love this film. the noir imagery combined with spillane's no nonsense character mike hammer works marvellously to create a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detective films of the early fifties. it may not be 'the maltese falcon' but this film makes it's own solid contribution to the genre. spillane is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc, but his 'dames' are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. poor old mike hammer, as effectively played by biff elliott, is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of an army buddy. when the penny finally drops his face is a picture. good to see that 50s censorship did not force the film makers to omit the famous last line. a bona fide low budget classic.
