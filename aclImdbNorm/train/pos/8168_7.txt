the dentist starts on the morning of dr. alan feinstone (corbin bernsen) & his wife brooke's (linda hoffman) wedding anniversary. on the surface mr. & mrs. feinstone seem to have a nice life, a beautiful home in los angeles & he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong. alan discovers that brooke is having an affair with matt (michael stadvec) the swimming pool cleaner, to add to his humiliation alan then discovers that matt is also having sex with paula roberts (lise simms) one of his next door neighbours & to top it all off he owes the irs, who are breathing down his neck, a shed load of money. alan starts to lose his mind, he convinces himself that everything is decayed & rotten, just like his patient's teeth, & it's up to him to fix it. that morning at work he begins to take his frustrations & anger out on his patients, first he injures a young boy named jody (brian mclaughlin), he sexual assault's a patient named april reign (christa sauls) after he hallucinates that she is his wife & deliberately performs an unnecessary & painful procedure on another. alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it & goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife & pool cleaner...<br /><br />directed by brian yuzna i thought the dentist was a good film & tried something a bit different. the script by dennis paoli, stuart gordon & charles finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as i was expecting the latter, it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like friday the 13th (1980) with a high body count & a wise cracking dentist villain but what the dentist actually turned out to be is very different. the dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness & it does a fine job although having said that i'm not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions. it moves along at a nice pace, has a nice narrative in which i liked the constant connection alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients & the decay he sees in the world around him & is an entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes. it goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you'll never go again! i liked the ending too where the tables are turned, i'll say no more...<br /><br />director yuzna does his usual fine job here, in fact i don't think i've seen a yuzna film that i didn't enjoy to some extent, he obviously & predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people's teeth out, sexually molesting them, performing operations on drugs & torturing people with the dreaded dentist's drill. there are some other gore scenes as well, a dead dog, someone gorily slashed with a knife & cut out tongues. yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget, he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles & i liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed & huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angle.<br /><br />technically the dentist is fine, decent cinematography, music & production values although some of the special make-up effects look a little unconvincing. the acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with corbin putting in a good crackpot performance. the ever cool & genre favourite ken foree turns up as detective gibbs one of los angeles finest.<br /><br />the dentist didn't turn out like i had expected & all the better for it, if your a horror fan & perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out. i liked it & think it's definitely worth a watch.
