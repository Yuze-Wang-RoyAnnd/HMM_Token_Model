chalk this one up in the win column, this was a superb movie. the acting performances were great and the script was equally great.<br /><br />helen hunt was magnificent as the riverside police officer gina pulasky. gina was a complex character. she was a rookie cop with the riverside police dept. she ended up in an affair with a coworker that she knew had a wife and kids, all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer. <br /><br />jeff fahey (the ray liotta look alike) did a bang up job as the confused, often stammering, police officer that had an affair with gina. he was stoic as an officer, but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra-marital affair.<br /><br />steven weber, most notably from the sitcom "wings", did a nice job as the quiet, meek, underachieving sociopath. on the surface, he was an innocent loser, but beneath the surface lied a cold hearted killer. weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys.<br /><br />the entire movie was spectacular. each scene, each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters. the production team did a phenomenal job with condensing days, if not weeks worth of events into a 90 minute movie. this movie was a good example of doing a lot with little.
