i thought this movie was hysterical. i have watched it many times and recommend it highly. mel brooks, was excellent. the cast was fantastic..i don't understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating. i loved it.. i have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor.. his i just can't say enough about this movie. i look for it to be on periodically but it never on enough for me. the people playing the homeless people were by comparison up to the funniest standards also. please put this movie on more often. i can't see it enough..leslie ann warren also was another favorite of mine, ever since cinderella. i always thought that she wasn't really funny but loved her acting. in this movie she was very funny..and her and mel did a great job together. they should put more of his movies on tv.
