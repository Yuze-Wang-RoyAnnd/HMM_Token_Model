will all of you please lay the hell off todd sheets!?! let's give you $30,000 to make a movie and see what you come up with! the guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for free! sure the acting is laughable at times. yes the make-up is not greatest you'll ever see. but it's not the worst either, if you want to see that, go watch zombie nation with it's raccoon zombies.<br /><br />this is pure, good old fashioned guerilla film-making! todd is a consummate professional, and an all around nice guy. there are holes in the plot, yes. the plot does seem far-fetched. but what the hell, i still love this movie. i wish todd sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to. if anyone has ever tried to make a movie, they know that just finishing it, is an achievement in and of itself.
