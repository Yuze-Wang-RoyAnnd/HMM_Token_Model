"father is still away on business" was headline of an review after "promise me this" premiere in cannes. i do understand why many thinks the same but unique expression of kusturica is still present in his new movie and is something why critics can't touch him. i had two hours of pure energy without rest. even when kusturica is suffering of lack of concentration or fear of empty space he is still unique and unspoiled. surprisingly good performance of stribor kusturica. much more close-ups and less landscapes then in "life is a miracle". marija petronijevic has femme fatal world class potential, please don't spoil it. surely, i recommend to everyone to see this film.
