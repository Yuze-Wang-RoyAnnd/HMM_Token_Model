this film has a lot of strong points. it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosi-karloff-chaney circle: lionel atwill, fay wray, and dwight frye, plus leading man melvyn douglas. it's got all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone staircases, a mad scientist, townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires, an "igor"-type character, a beautiful girl, even a goofy-haired burgomeister. the soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative. there's even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script.<br /><br />but it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in "kleinschloss" ("little castle"). the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist (nicely played by atwill) who values his work more highly than human lives.<br /><br />it's not top-tier material, because of a ho-hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye. but it's worth a look if you like early b/w horror pictures.
