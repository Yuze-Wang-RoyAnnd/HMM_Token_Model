jake speed (1986) was an amusing parody of indiana jones and other adventurer films that were popular during the eighties. wayne crawford stars as jake speed, an adventurer who's always battling evil doers wherever he goes. with his assistant desmond floyd (dennis christopher) they globe trot looking for some action (and some decent story lines). the duo meet a young woman named margaret (karen kopins) who's sister has been kidnapped by an evil white slaver trader (john hurt). can she find and convince jake and desmond to help her rescue her sibling?<br /><br />a sappy and cheesy film that doesn't pretend to be something that it's not. i have to give this one a recommendation. that's if you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who don't take everything at face value.<br /><br />recommended.
