the third, and final installment of "hanzo the razor" is the most concrete of them all. the "training" even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film. not for everyone, this film details hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. it also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old japan to incorporate western technology. where the first hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to it's plot, "hanzo 3: who's got the gold" manages to connect everything, and brings it all home in the end. definitely the perfect finale. oh yeah, hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there's a lot of needless blood and violence (it *is* hanzo the razor after all).
