rock 'n' roll high school was one of the best movies ever made! i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones! you couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the sex pistols, or the clash in place of the ramones, it just wouldn't have been the same. dey young, clint howard, vincent van patten, mary woronov, paul bartel, and the hall monters, just added to the movie. the whole entire movie is about the ramones...especially joey! so everybody showed see rock 'n' roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk. not the sissy new crap...but the loud, and fast kind. the kind only the ramones could do. r.i.p (rest in peace) joey ramone 1951-2001. dee dee ramone 1952-2002!
