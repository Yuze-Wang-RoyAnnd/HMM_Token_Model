quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids. john thaw is brilliant as always (without any hint of inspector morse about him). the boy playing william did a good job as well though i didn't find him convincing in every scene. i loved the whole feel of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times. i also felt the scenes in london where historically accurate, as far as i could tell.<br /><br />it strongly reminded me of a scandinavian film i saw a couple of years ago called mother of mine. that film featured a boy being evacuated from finland to sweden during ww ii. the wife of the family taking him in asked for a girl because (as it turns out)she lost her daughter. getting a boy instead she completely ignores him. the fact that the boy speaks finnish complicates matters even further. i highly recommend that film to anyone who enjoyed goodnight mr. tom, it has the same feel to it.
