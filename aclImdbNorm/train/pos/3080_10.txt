i have complained to abc about the cancellation of six degrees. if enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life!! just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough. i do not understand why this show has been cancelled. what a fantastic show, cast and characters. the whole concept is gripping viewing! i am astounded that my favourite show is over after just one series. why is this? six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than so many other tv programmes out there! until i heard they were stopping it from a friend it hadn't even occurred to me that this might happen.
