this is a movie that gets better each time i see it. there are so many nuanced performances in this. william tracey, as pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. joseph schildkraut as vadas, is the only "villian" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here. frank morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, mr. matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here. i especially liked the performance of felix bressart, as pirovitch. very believable in every facet of his role.<br /><br />the two leads are equally accomplished, with margaret sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman.<br /><br />this movie belongs to jimmy stewart though. the movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. mr. stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. just watch stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. he is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. in my estimation, james stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. there is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. at the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft. this is one of jimmy stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. i greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of stewart.
