this movie is more lupin then most, especially coming from funimation. other then the bad dub, it isn't bad.<br /><br />the first hour is a lot like the comic (which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on). lupin's trying to get a huge treasure. fujiko's using lupin's weakness to women to try to get something out of it. the last bit isn't that bad, he's with another women, but of course fujiko's still him number one.<br /><br />a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin. any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised (i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie). it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits (they make it a little mushy) but overall, it isn't a bad film. good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the lupin iii movies.
