vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006, coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career. i am not too keen in romantic movies these days, because i see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. however, i have watched this movie three times now...and believe me it's an awesome movie.<br /><br />vivah goes back to the traditional route, displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. in that sense sooraj r. barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately: <br /><br />* when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride (amrita rao) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family. the song 'do anjaane ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene.<br /><br />* the first conversation between shahid and amrita, when he comes to see her - i.e. a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation. also amrita's naive nature, limited eye-contact, shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid's questions.<br /><br />* the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle (alok nath) when she feeds him at shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved niece.<br /><br />clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way. the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her. she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie, and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly.<br /><br />shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too. he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r. barjatya film. in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on-screen couple, without a shadow of doubt. other characters - alok nath (excellent), anupam kher (brilliant), mohan joshi (very good).<br /><br />on the whole, vivah delivers what it promised, a well made and realistic story of two families. the movie has top-notch performances, excellent story and great music to suit the film, as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r. barjatya. it's a must see!
