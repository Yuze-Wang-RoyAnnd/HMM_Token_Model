what starts out as generational conflict in this movie, ends in understanding, solemnity and grace. the movie meanders through europe with the father and the young son cramped in a car over 3000 miles. the cramping forces lifestyles, beliefs and life skills to collide. there's really no clear winner. it all adds up in the end as experience, experience of multiple layers of life. for those interested in understanding islam, this movie offers a generous and gentle outlook, without being pushy about the agenda. it's a coming of age story for the young son, his dismissive and rebellious nature turning to openness for receiving more ways of life.
