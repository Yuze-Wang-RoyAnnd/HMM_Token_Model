the question is, can a movie this entertaining really be considered a "bad" movie? my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words "vestron pictures" on it (vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films "suburbia" and "class of 1984"). we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was. your basic plot as is follows: grange, this goombaesque thug from planet earth, robs "the bank of the moon" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (i don't even remember the planet's name) to mine for bauxite and other minerals. the "governor" of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor. walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the whole planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there's only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they'd have him to deal with. then there's the nameless "colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare. much of the movie centers around "futuristic" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides) with explosions galore. the planet itself looks suspiciously like hemet, ca or one of those other dusty inland empire outposts. but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid-80s. i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack. i can't even remember the names of the bands (they're listed in the credits) other than exploding white mice, because that was the only one i'd heard of before i saw this movie, but i'm definitely looking into them.<br /><br />basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends.
