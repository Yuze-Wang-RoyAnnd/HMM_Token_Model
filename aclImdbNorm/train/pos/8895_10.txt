i accidently felt on this movie on tv, and i wasn't able to leave it.... it's really an excellent movie which makes people learning about american's history with the vietnam war, the flower power's time, the racism's fight.... it illustrates the conflict of generation, of political opinion, of race which took place in the 60's....i'm born in 1980 so i didn't know all that stuff before...in france, usa's history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts ! by the way, i think all the actors are great; especially jordana brewster, josh hamilton and jerry o'connell. now i can see this film more then 1 time each day !! it's really great.... what a shame it only appeared on tv not in cinemas...<br /><br />
