this movie has taken a lot of stick. it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas cage's career. the thing i don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant "bruck-buster" action at its best. fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. also, for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. it has everything: ferraris, mercs, a hummer and lets not forget eleanor! i think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all!! then again maybe that's just me!
