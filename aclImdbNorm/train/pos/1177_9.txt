i have seen a lot of ppv's in the past but this is the most entertaining, intense ppv and the most complete dvd i have ever seen. the dvd extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show (such as the chris benoit interview/edge interview), some glimpse into the monday night wars era,the first match of hogan winning tag title gold and some promotional talk. additionally there is a good music video.<br /><br />1. tag team table match: bubby ray and spike dudley vs. eddie guerro and chris benoit 7/10 this was a pretty good intense match to start off the show. not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity. spike can hold his own in tables matches and guerro and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat. <br /><br />2. wwe crusierweight championship: jamie noble w/ nidia v. billy kidman 3/10 the crowd really didn't care about either wrestler and didn't get interested until kidman did a shooting star press. usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weight championship, but this had very little. in fact it was so bad that when noble hit his finisher, no one even cared or knew (you can tell by the lack of camera's flashing). the ending was quick though. <br /><br />3. wwe european championship: jeff hardy v. william regal 5/10 i've never really liked regal as a wrestler, he lacks intensity and style. hardy was impressive but really didn't get a chance to show off his high flying act, although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match. it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match. <br /><br />4. john cena v. chris jericho 6/10 it's funny looking back at cena's very first ppv, how he used to act, how he used to dress, and how he used to look (watch his interview, it's pretty funny). this was a good intense match with cena showing a nice variety of holds, suplexes, counters and some aerial. jericho was sub-par but definitely helped cena launch his career. cena wins.<br /><br />5. wwe intercontenital championship: rvd v. brock lesnar 8/10 this was a very intense and good match. both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen, with brocks pure power and raw energy vs. rvds skill full moves and quickness. rvd looked great in this match (better than his later matches with edge and cena)and the entire match was fast pace. the ending worked perfectly because it still preserved brock's undefeated streak while giving rvd his just desserts in his home state.<br /><br />6. no disqualification match: booker t v. big show 7/10 another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the rvd match but still a good follow up. although it started off kinda slow (which it always is with big show) booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table. the finisher was awesome, the ending was a great upset and big move up for booker t.<br /><br />7. wwe tag team championship: hogan and edge v. christian and lance storm 5/10 this was a mediocre match. hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy. then again christian doesn't exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself. this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for ppv. <br /><br />8. triple threat match for the undisputed championship: 10/10. rock v. undertaker v. kurt angle.<br /><br />easily the match of the year. this is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen. it had close falls, plenty of finishers, stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. no one could predict who would come out of this one. if your going to buy this dvd i would buy it strictly for this match. (ending? watch for yourself!)<br /><br />overall this was a solid ppv with plenty of extra goodies to keep you watching again and again. although this is hard to find (i had to pay a little more than usual for this dvd) it is definitely worth your money.
