i think "anyway..." is a kick-ass movie. really. tom barman spent like years making it, and it shows: every scene is polished, has a meaning,... i guess most agree on that. one thing many people tend to criticize is the "lack" of story. i'm afraid that that's an effect of us being overwhelmed with "traditional" storytelling, all the time. i mean: what you can achieve with a book, you can't achieve with a movie, what you can achieve with a movie, you cannot achieve it by just telling it to a buddy. the problem is that we're so used to movies, series,... to be just a filmed version of a story; a visual recording of events -just like when you watch the news- that we expect every movie to have this epic characteristics: a strong storyline with a lot of unusual events. and i stress the idea of "unusual events": most people see on tv in the news, in movies, series,... very unusual things, once-in-a-lifetime situations. and here, in "anyway...", there are unusual events, but not in the same "hollywood big explosion" kind of way: guy gets fired, couple back together, car gets stolen... and of course very usual things. and that's strong: just being able to appreciate all of that, that universe, that's art. and i agree that especially what can only be achieved in movies, that atmosphere created by the score and the photography is put central. but not like in traditional visual movies (visual blockbusters such as the matrix); it serves the characters and remains deeply human. i mean, in every shot you feel the love that tom barman has for antwerp and urban lifestyle. and he has no point with this movie, like to "learn" us something; and he has no big story to tell with incredible scenario twists. he just shows everyday people with everyday lives, he shows a city, all with their good and bad sides and says: this is us, that's our city, that's life, let's enjoy it. so basically, "anyway..." is not only that super groovy movie, it also has a much stronger "message" (it's not explicit, maybe even not intended) than most movies how really intend to pass a message. one drawback: now, we'll have to wait five years to see the next barman pic, and everyone will expect so much of it...
