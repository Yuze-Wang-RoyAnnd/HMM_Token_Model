it was only when i saw napoleon dynamite that i remembered seeing cracker bag. just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy. there is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant. it captures more than the nostalgia of the time. it has a real heart to it. it is the achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful. a simple story is always effective when done well. this glendyn ivin has a big future and i for one, am looking out for his next project. the follow up is always the most difficut thing. it's like the second album blues for most people. <br /><br />i just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film. cheers to all. enjoy your cinema.
