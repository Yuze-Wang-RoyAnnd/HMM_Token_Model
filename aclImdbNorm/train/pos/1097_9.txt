i stopped short of giving "mr. blandings builds his dream house" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant (somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit). but other than that, the movie's a hoot. portraying middle class new york couple jim (cary grant) and muriel blandings (myrna loy) trying to build a house in connecticut, this flick has something for everyone.<br /><br />grant is his usual flippant self, while loy does quite well as merely a wife. but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as jim's and muriel's lawyer bill cole, who seems to have more plans than he's making clear. as for the house itself...throughout most of the movie, you'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there. the builders, contractors, and others also provide their fair share of laughs.<br /><br />all in all, a comedy classic. also starring louise beavers, reginald denny, sharyn moffett, connie marshall and jason robards sr.
