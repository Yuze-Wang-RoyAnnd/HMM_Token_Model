one of my favorite shows in the 80's. after the first season, it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast. deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest borgnine's character go at it with each other. the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season. unfortunately during those days, blacks did not last long on television shows. some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show. when it went to usa, it was disgusting!!!
