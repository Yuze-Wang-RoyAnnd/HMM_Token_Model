when i was chairman of our college's coffeehouse, one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities. one of the best things to come along in 1972 was groove tube. the original premise was that it was being shown off-off broadway in theaters where television monitors were being placed throughout the audience, so everyone had a great seat. the premise was that the skits would change on a regular basis-ala saturday night live, keeping the thing fresh. they decided on making it into a film for general distribution.<br /><br />i believe the developers said it was the first time chevy chase was on film. watching him run naked though the woods was a howl. like many of the reviews before mine, it was saturday night live before such a thing existed. i highly recommend this vid. i've told my 13 year old son about koko the clown- he can't wait to get a copy!
