steven spielberg (at 24) had already directed two superb episodes of a 1971 series called "the psychiatrist", starring roy thinnes. one episode had been about an emotionally troubled 12-year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man (clu gulager in his best performance) who is dying of cancer. both episodes were stunning, visually unlike anything else on tv, and emotionally complex and adult. the creators of "the psychiatrist" were richard levinson and william link, who created "columbo" and also produced its first season.<br /><br />peter falk insisted on first rank, experienced tv directors for the first season of "columbo", like bernard kowalski and jack smight. but falk agreed to spielberg after watching part of the clu gulagher episode of "the psychiatrist".<br /><br />spielberg says on the dvd of "duel" that he loved steven bochco's "murder by the book" script (based on a levinson/link story), and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature, even thought he had a lot less money to work with.<br /><br />this episode of "columbo" is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other "columbo" episode, even though the series always used top directors. spielberg manages to keep the great falk and cassidy from hamming it up too much, but both actors are still a lot of fun. spielberg also gets fine supporting work from martin milner, rosemary forsyth and barbara colby. all the performances have a freshness and vitality about them. the only "columbo" episode that was close to being as well directed is the "by dawn's early light" episode with patrick mcgoohan (directed by harvey hart).<br /><br />i think the two episodes of "the psychiatrist" and this episode of "columbo" suggest spielberg hasn't developed technically all that much as a director. he was great from the beginning. in a "combat!" dvd commentary of a 1962 episode guest starring albert salmi, robert altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director. maybe the same is true of spielberg.
