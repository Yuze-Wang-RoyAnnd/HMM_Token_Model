i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before. so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards. as could be expected, i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy. come on, guys, a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography (nor a novel!). any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art in its own right. a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people (including some that now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
