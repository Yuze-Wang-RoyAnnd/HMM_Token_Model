how amazing this film is! i've seen it over and over throughout the years and i'm always spellbound by it. the reason why the film is so easy to re-watch is, of course, the arresting performance given by the young bette davis. she not only steals every scene that she's in, but is actually much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio, warner brothers (this film was made by r.k.o. radio pictures). she wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those lovely big eyes (especially, in the restaurant scenes that take place in london's soho). her body was so curvy when she was young. get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with leslie howard. and oh boy, she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene. howard is a little too nervous throughout, but he does captures the hero's sensitivity. frances dee scores as the sweet, pretty young sally who truly loves him. max steiner's score is both charming and poignant. splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel.
