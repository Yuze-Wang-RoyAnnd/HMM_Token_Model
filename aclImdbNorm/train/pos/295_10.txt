bogdonovich's (mostly) unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other. a film that has the feel of a fairy tale, but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and "true" geography, perhaps the best location filming in nyc i've ever seen. john ritter reminds us that with good directors (bogdanovich, blake edwards, billy bob) he can be brilliant, and the entire ensemble is a group you'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with `em. one of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else, this is the high point of bogdanovich's fertile after- "success" career, when his best work was truly done ("saint jack", "at long last...", "noises off".
