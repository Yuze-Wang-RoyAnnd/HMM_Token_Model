"the golden child" was eddie murphy's first film since his megahit "beverly hills cop". and even though it's not as good as "cop", it's a fun comic adventure. murphy stars as a finder of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case. his assignment: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. this movie could have been titled "beverly hills cop and the temple of doom" since parts of this movie plays like a spielbergian adventure, kinda like an indiana jones comedy. it's got comedy with laughs, and adventure with special effects. lots of fun.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
