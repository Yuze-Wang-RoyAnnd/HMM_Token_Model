the sopranos (1999-2007)<br /><br />number 1 - television show of all time <br /><br />everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode. the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time. <br /><br />james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss, tony soprano, accompanied by a stellar cast. edie falco is superb as the worrying, loving upper-middle class mother; tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious, greying consiglieri who is often very funny. <br /><br />while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian-americans as mafiosi, and to an extent this is undeniable, i can see so many positives from the show. the portrayal of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters? yes. furthermore, other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. this is no shallow, dull show about tough guys and violence. it has so much more. many of the issues we see on the show are very real. <br /><br />the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives, which makes the whole thing more interesting.<br /><br />credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini, for envisioning, television's most complex and enigmatic character. <br /><br />simply exceptional.<br /><br />10/10
