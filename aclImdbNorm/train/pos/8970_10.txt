i researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post wwii greenwich village world of gays and lesbians. with the exception of stewart and novak, the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. john van druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this greenwich village. i thought this was ironic because i first saw bell, book and candle in the theater when i was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. it was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and i planned on being bored. but, i remember the moment when jimmy stewart embraced kim novak on the top of the flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. as the glorious george duning love theme soared, i suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love. the first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as i left the theater. i am sure i'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by kim novak's startling, direct gaze. it's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us. i am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as i watched that hat touch down fifty years later . . .
