ella was excellent, franchot was unavoidably over-the-top (but he played similar parts in other films such as "the man on the eiffel tower") and alan was nearly non-existent but the film certainly "thrilled".<br /><br />*mild spoiler ahead*: i wonder how many times elisha cook got strangled in his films but i seem to recall various other examples. i will avoid naming the murderer but i think it's necessarily obvious because of the plot "thriller" demands.<br /><br />a very well-done but dated film noire (for example: everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters. and no dead bodies were ever shown, unlike today's gore fests.) done in the familiar short-scene tableaux format of the period.<br /><br />8 out of 10.
