after just having watched the deer hunter,which is a masterpiece,the movie jacknife had big shoes to fill.it has same themes as the deer hunter,the devastating effects on a person after the vietnam war.robert de niro is in this film,as in the deer hunter and is very good here,as is kathy baker.but this movie belongs to ed harris,who gives a powerful,emotional and impactful performance.the movie is based on a stage play,and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me.by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play.that was not that big a deal,and doesn't really diminish the film.i actually really liked this movie.it's not an epic like the deer hunter.they are about similar era and have similar themes,but they are two very different films.i thought the deer hunter was great,and i also think this movie was great.it's the acting in this one that makes it so great.for me,jacknife is a 10/10
