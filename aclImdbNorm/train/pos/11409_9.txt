when philo vance (edmund lowe) is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city, apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his death,it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later, "the woman in green" in which sherlock holmes (basil rathbone)is similarly about to hurl himself into space while being hypnotized. <br /><br />happily, both philo vance and sherlock holmes survive these attempts at murder by unscrupulous criminals. exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes. when will they learn you can't cloud the minds of great fictional detectives ?
