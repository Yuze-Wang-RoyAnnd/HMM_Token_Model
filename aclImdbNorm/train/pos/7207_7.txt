i went into deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while that's something like what this film is; i also can't help but think that it's just a poor man's sleuth. the classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of the plot, but certainly it's the case with the execution. the casting of michael caine in the central role just confirms it. the film is based on a play by ira levin (who previously wrote rosemary's baby and the stepford wives) and focuses on sidney bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. after his latest play bombs, sidney finds himself at a low; and this is not helped when a play named deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught, arrives on his doorstep. deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe, killing him, and then passing deathtrap off as his own work.<br /><br />despite all of its clever twists and turns; deathtrap falls down on one primary element, and that's the characters. the film fails to provide a single likable character, and it's very hard to care about the story when you're not rooting for any of the players. this is not helped by the acting. michael caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but nobody else does themselves proud. christopher reeve is awkward in his role, while dyan cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance. it's lucky then that the story is good; and it is just about good enough to save the film. the plot features plenty of twists and turns; some work better than others, but there's always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting. director sidney lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus. the central location is interesting in its own right, and the cinematography fits the film well. overall, i have to admit that i did enjoy this film; but it could have been much, much better.
