a great story, based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the road. being that this is denzel washington's first ever movie that he himself was gonna direct, i have to admit i was a tad sceptical, but who wouldn't be..? but then again, he's a great actor with plently of years of experience, and the end result turned out great. the story is told in a great way, making you that has had difficulties during your childhood, and young adulthood, see yourself in those situations. so, it hits you hard, letting you know your not the only one going through hell. in all, a touching story about a young man trying to make it in this f***ed up world. (the story is based on the life of antwone fisher, born 3. august 1959, cleveland, ohio, usa, whom was also the writer of this movie) strongly recommended. 8/10
