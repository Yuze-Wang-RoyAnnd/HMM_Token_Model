the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was robby the robot. my preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci-fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for. how wrong i was. big studio, big budget and big production values make this a strong contender, at least visually, for the best sci-fi film coming out of the era. i qualify with the word visually, because "war of the worlds" is a lot darker and scarier than "forbidden planet", and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory.<br /><br />what impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography, followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in dr. morbius' (walter pidgeon) home and laboratory. but that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake, the labyrinthine underground that served as the krell stronghold. it appeared that krell technology was even more advanced than say, that of "star wars". which made me consider, audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with sw, or in 1986 with "aliens". watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect, and i'm fairly resistant to hyperbole.<br /><br />it's not too much of a stretch to imagine "forbidden planet" as a direct antecedent of the 'star trek' tv series; gene roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show. followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in 'star trek'. i had to do a double take when the men of united planets cruiser c57-v headed for a transporter room, while the conundrum presented to robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st series.<br /><br />where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of 'monsters from the id'. that morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend altaire iv was certainly a unique concept for 1956, when every other sci-fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures. the film worked it's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that morbius was the protector of altaire iv some time before commander adams (leslie nielsen) explained it.<br /><br />you know, looking at the calendar, the year 2200 isn't that far off. this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets. i think though, that they'll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of robby.
