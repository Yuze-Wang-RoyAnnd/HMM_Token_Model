red eye is not the kind of movie that's going to win the palme d'or, but wes craven has never been that kind of director, anyway, and his branding is a good indication of what a film-goer can expect.<br /><br />the fact that red eye is a tight little, undemanding package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of craven's craft in producing lightweight, but generally enjoyable, box office fare. in fact, it's the perfect kind of movie to show as inflight entertainment, attention-holding without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer.<br /><br />overall there is a cheesy feeling to the plot, vague terrorist subplot motivation and the supporting characters, and the main section has a tv movie feel. however, there are definite elements of hitchcockian suspense, and echoes of schumacher's phone booth, which ultimately is a more sophisticated (and pretentious) play on the same idea of emotional crisis being played out suppressed in public.<br /><br />for a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airline seats, it lives or dies on the characters and script. cillian's icy but eloquent jackson rippner and rachel macadams resourceful lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off. not only making the dialogue zing but also giving some sort of adam's rib type dimension to their battle of 'male logic' against feminine 'sensitivity'.<br /><br />in the final portion of the film craven indulges himself a little scream style as man-chases-girl-with-knife. the most surprising revelation here is what brian cox looks like after the 'just for men' treatment, his ubiqutous appearance in films as diverse as super troopers, the ring and this making him the sexegenarian version of jude law.<br /><br />short haul fun.
