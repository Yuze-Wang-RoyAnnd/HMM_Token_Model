dog days is one of most accurate films i've ever seen describing life in modern cities. it's very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly it's very close to reality. isolation, desperation, deep emotional dead ends, problematic affairs, perversion, complexes, madness. all the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today. it makes you realize once again the pityful state in which people have lead society. <br /><br />the negative side of life in the city was never pictured on screen so properly. i only wish it was a lie. unfortunately, it isn't. therefore...10/10.
