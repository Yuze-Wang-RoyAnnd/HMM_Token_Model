my kids recently started watching the reruns of this show - both the early episodes on the n, and the later ones on abc family - and they love it. (i wasn't aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season) i'm curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes - i've seen them described as "highly publicized," and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes. (personally, i don't see a whole lot of difference - the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout - but they do lose some great people along the way) my daughter has put the dvds on her wish list, so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this. i also wish they'd done some self-referential humor about the changes - like on "boy meets world" where they drop the little sister for an entire season or so, and when a different actor later shows up playing her, they ask her where she's been and she says "upstairs," or when early series token geek "minkus" shows up for the high school graduation, they ask him where he's been and he says "over there," pointing to the part of the classroom never shown by the camera, before saying "hey, mr. turner, wait up!" and running off screen (mr. turner being another character who left) oh well - maybe there will be an e true hollywood story on this or something? i was just glad to see aunt hilda show up for the finale - she was always one of my favorites - it's too bad it couldn't have been a more encompassing cast reunion. (the zelda candle just didn't cut it for me)
