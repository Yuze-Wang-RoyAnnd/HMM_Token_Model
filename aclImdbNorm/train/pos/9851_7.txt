shrek, anyone? well, imagine shrek in the ice age. remember the ending of shrek? of cause you do. now, imagine, that shrek turns into a human, and so does the princess. get it? nice animation, actually, much more of an art work than pixar and disney pictures, which are trying to get as close to reality as possible in their drawings. strong one-liners, some social comments that kids won't understand, the good guys win. one thing more: scrat. by the way, how does everybody know his name is scrat? 7/10
