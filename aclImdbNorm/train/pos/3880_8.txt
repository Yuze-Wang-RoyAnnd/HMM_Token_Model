well, for starters, this actually was the most elegant clausen film to this date.<br /><br />the man's always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them, but i think that he in this movie adds a dimension unparrallel to anything he's made earlier. his work has - in very black n' white words - been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience, and we've always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to say.<br /><br />in "villa paranoia, however, for the first time, he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the minorities. not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget. set in jutland - in 'the country' - it deals with the everlasting issue of lack of love, but in a close and at times brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused. and on top of that, he himself manages to play a b******d! a true b*****d, who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there, and people therefore suffer. bitterly.<br /><br /> i'd have to say it's one of the best movies i've seen this year and i'm greatly anticipating his next.
