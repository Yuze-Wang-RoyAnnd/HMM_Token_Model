the story deals about jet li who has to fight against his old<br /><br />friends.but there is one problem, the friends are superfighters. the film is filled with blood, super action and the best stunts forever. and lau ching-wan is a great co-actor. of course the movie has the typical hk-fun.but i love it! in germany "black mask" is uncut.
