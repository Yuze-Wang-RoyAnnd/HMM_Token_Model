i enjoyed a lot watching this movie. it has a great direction, by the already know bigas luna, born in spain. and it is precisely in spain that the movie takes place, in catalu~na, to be more precise.<br /><br />luna explores once more the theme of an obcession, in this case the obcession of a young boy for the women's milk. there are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother. in the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother's milk go to the recently born son. so he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him. he finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this.<br /><br />this movie lives a lot on imagery, more than the story itself, the espectator captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something...). the surroundings, the landscapes, typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters, also symbolic, and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by nicola piovani transport us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but which intersects it from times to times... worth living in that world, worth watching this movie, even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession, which is perhaps taken beyond the limits...<br /><br />i also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist... 8/10
