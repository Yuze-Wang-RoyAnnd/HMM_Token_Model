i recall seeing this movie as a kid. i don't recall where i saw it. i must have been around 14 years old. i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again. it came on the kung fu channel once, but i missed it. i was really bummed. it is the best special-effects kung fu movie that i've seen to date! i highly recommend it, and now that i've discovered where to get it, i can enjoy it once more and for years to come. i also have to check out this return of the venom movie of which some have spoken so highly.
