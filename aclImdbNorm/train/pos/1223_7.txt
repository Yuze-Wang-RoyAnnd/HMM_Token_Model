about a year and a half ago my dad told me about the french doors. i thought it sounded interesting enough but i didn't try to find it anywhere. then about a year ago i remembered that film and thought "hey why not" and tried finding it on the internet. eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films. i called my dad over to the computer and said to him" hey dad i've found that creepy film you told me about ages ago!" he smiled at me, turned round turned off the lights so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen and told me to watch it. i started off fine...then when he started getting worried about whatever was there i found it very unnerving. at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up...it made me jump!:p if you haven't seen this film i highly recommend you do because it is well worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling.<br /><br />great film!
