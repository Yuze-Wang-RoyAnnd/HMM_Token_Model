kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star, even though he keeps his pants on.<br /><br />the movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life. i don't think i can think of another movie, except perhaps zeffirelli's romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that well.<br /><br />the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously. in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery, without the mayhem.<br /><br />this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages.
