'the second beginning' as it's title explains, shows us the beginning of the end for the human race. set long before the matrix existed, this short anime written by the wachowski's shows us the world that could lay infront of us in the not to distant future, set at the turn of the 21st century, the second renaissance delves into issues common with human behaviour; greed, power, control, vanity etc.<br /><br />the use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servents is common among science fiction/fantasy stories. the second renaissance is no exeption to this concept, however instead of a simple man vs. machine layout, this story explains the struggle that the machines put up with, the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans. where the matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story.<br /><br />the second renaissance part 1 + 2, answer many questions brought up by the original matrix film, such as how the war broke out, how the sky was blackend, what led to the use of humans as batteries and it also introduces us to the machine city called 01, which may have relevance to the upcoming matrix revolutions film.<br /><br />i won't give away too much of the story, as i do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers, however, i will recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the matrix or simply anybody interested in japanese animation (anime).<br /><br />9/10.
