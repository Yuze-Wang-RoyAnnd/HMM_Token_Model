actually, i never bought into the metal was satanic and stuff, but this movie kind of played on that idea. though certainly not a movie to take seriously or to rate really high, it does serve its purpose in that it entertains while it is playing. the story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream to this effect and said band starts to go on a kill spree from beyond the grave. so yes, a bit of "nightmare on elm street" plot going on here. granted freddy never molested a girl in a car before. there was another movie featuring a heavy metal band in it, but it was very different in how it played out as it had a band that kind of took over a town of kids and made them crazy. this one simply has the one fan of the band kind of helping the killer spirit at first then trying to stop him. nothing to gruesome in it as i do not remember all that many gory kills. quite frankly, the scene i do remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being molested by some creature incarnation of the band. nothing great, but a nice time filler.
