but the opposite, sorry bud, i completely understand how you can be dragged into a film because you relate to the subject ( and you have). this film is terrible, the main character would give any charlie brown subtitler a run for his money he just constantly mumbles which is always a laugh, most scenes just feel awkward with characters more often than not gazing across to another with a look of...its your line now, then i will react. best british comedy? please buddy, have a strong word with your bad bad self...at the end of the day ...the sun goes down...and this film is awful. i mean well done to the people involved...they have made a film...and maybe motorbike enthusiasts may be into it but people that still live here on earth with an actual sense of humour will struggle with this more than smiling at the christmas present they're nan bought them...was that overly harsh? i do apologise...
