in cold blood is masterfully directed and adapted by richard brooks. however, it's also so bent on being realistic, it's sometimes more clinical than entertaining. recounting the brutal killing of a midwest family, author truman capote focused on minutia, wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject and subjects! brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama. although he films on actual locations, he keeps his distance. the murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles, which surely they were. they're not seen as misunderstood souls (as in the capote book) and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt. scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast, including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter (the capote "character?") the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall.
