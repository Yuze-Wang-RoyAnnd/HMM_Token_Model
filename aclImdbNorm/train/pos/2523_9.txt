when i first heard about moon child, i thought it was a joke. after a few months, i figured i guess it's for real. the few reviews i read that weren't made by squealing fangirls were not very promising.<br /><br />when i was given the opportunity to watch it, i was fully prepared to groan, wince, and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the silliness.<br /><br />i was more than a little surprised, and in a good way.<br /><br />yes, moon child has its moments of cheese, camp, and general dorkiness -- i think that's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves gackt camui, a man not known for his sanity -- but all in all, it was wholly enjoyable.<br /><br />no, it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very, very heartfelt, amusing, with fun choreography, a touching score, and a fun cast. i know little of japanese cinema so i can't really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience, i was rather impressed.<br /><br />if you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, see this film. at least rent it since it's coming to region 1.<br /><br />on a side note, there is zero homosexual/homoerotic content in this film. i didn't even see much of a subtext. don't let people that read too much into things ruin this for you.
