this movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective, so i was hooked by the time the title came on. the theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to re-invent themselves, but not in a tricky way like identity or the usual suspects, but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting. the scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular. at one point jorgen (who owns the chicken farm) attends a seminar in laughing, where he's the worst student. his discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself. the movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people i see every day. there's not a lot of plot here. guessing the old man's secret is pretty easy, but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out. this movie appealed to me in the same way that sideways did, although the characters couldn't be more dissimilar.
