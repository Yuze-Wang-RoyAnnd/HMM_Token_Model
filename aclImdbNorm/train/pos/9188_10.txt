its too bad a lot of people didn't understand this and the next episode.<br /><br />but don't worry! ill explain it too you :)<br /><br />this episode is split in 2 parts.<br /><br />first part is tony's "dream" in his coma. second part is what happens in real life.<br /><br />now what people didn't understand is that tony's dream is more then just a dream. in this episode its about his preparation for his death. he loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself, thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world. you will notice what i'm saying at the doctor scene, where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains "his life". they makers really did a superb job of interpreting they're own thoughts of what happens when you die. <br /><br />if you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing, with great spiritual meanings.<br /><br />like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb. <br /><br />only thing i didn't understand was what the role where of the monks. gonna re watch it till i get this.<br /><br />anyways this episode really touched me, and i don't think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience.<br /><br />10/10 no doubt.
