i have watched this movie three times. the last time, i kept skipping around confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot. perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically. or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because ann's recall of distant events is rather faulty.<br /><br />take the young ann grant (claire danes). here is a young woman who has attended an unnamed college with the scions of a rich family. she must have had help to afford this very expensive education, but never seems to have any family ties at all. she never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect.<br /><br />ann shares an evening of passion with her great love harris arden (patrick wilson). then, when harris comforts lila after the tragic death of her brother buddy, ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior. i must have missed something significant here. ann's behavior seems totally inexplicable. ann abandons her relationship with harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at lila's wedding. despite ann's rejection of harris, she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed.<br /><br />it was obvious from his behavior that harris was deeply smitten with ann and would have gladly married her. a scene showing their chance meeting years after lila's wedding showed that harris still had deep feelings for ann.<br /><br />the film showed a pattern for ann's romantic relationships. she always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them. this pattern held with harris and two husbands. in contrast, lila married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died. perhaps lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail.<br /><br />then came the too convenient reappearance of lila ross at ann's bedside. apparently ann's nurse was able to extract enough information from ann's last few lucid moments to identify and contact lila. none of this communication appeared on the film.<br /><br />i kept wondering about the house ann was living in during her final days. how did she afford to buy such a house on the meager earnings of her singing career? ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters.<br /><br />on another level, i enjoyed the film's setting and music immensely. the seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful. claire danes was luminous as the young ann grant. she is really quite a talented singer. i much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras. if only those pesky cgi fireflies would go away, i could raise the movie a whole point in my vote!
