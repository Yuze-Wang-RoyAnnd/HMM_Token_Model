as an amateur historian of ww2/nazi germany, i couldn't wait for this to come out on dvd. i missed it when it was first on in 2003. i don't want to repeat what's already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments about the historical inaccuracies. a better job could've been done portraying the "charming" hitler. i also had a small problem with some of the casting choices, not so much for their acting, but for their appearances. peter stormare doesn't look much like rohm, why didn't they make babson as hess wear a wig? and my biggest complaint..so much has always been made of hitler's striking blue eyes, why didn't they make carlyle wear blue contacts? on the plus side, i thought the actors who played goring and drexler looked pretty good. again, as long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st, history 2nd i don't think a lot of harm will be done.
