i don't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless.<br /><br />what about just being entertained? something at which morgan freeman excels. he gets a chance to show off a bit. paz vega, his co-star, gets a career boost and brad silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie.<br /><br />i thought it was a good movie. some humor, some pathos, some bittersweetness but nothing over the top. i got an especial kick out of jim parsons as the receptionist at a construction company. when he looks at freeman adoringly and says, "you make me want to be a woman." he's just hilarious. the fight scene between ms. vega her ex-husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too.<br /><br />in short, it's a cute, charming film that will make you smile. you could do much, much worse.
