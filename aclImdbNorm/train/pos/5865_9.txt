saw this on cable back in the early 90's and loved it. never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently. still find it a great vietnam movie. not sure why its not higher rated. i found everything about this film compelling. as a vet (not from vietnam) i can relate to the situations brought by both harris and de niro. i can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in iraq. i wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see. the human toll on our soldiers isn't left on the battlefield. its brought home for the rest of there lives. and this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way. excellent film.
