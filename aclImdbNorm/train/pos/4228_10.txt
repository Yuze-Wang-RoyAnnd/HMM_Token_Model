a top notch columbo from beginning to end. i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer, ruth gordon.<br /><br />as an avid columbo fan, i can't recall another one in which he doesn't set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes. in this one, as he's trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the "message" that the nephew left behind, it finally dawns on him.<br /><br />the music in this episode is very good as well, as it is in many of other ones.
