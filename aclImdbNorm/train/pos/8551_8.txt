ti%s and as*, lots of boobies. some great characters, fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the amercan pie franchise. this feels like really old school. it feels a bit like porkys for the 2000's. some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for me.<br /><br />whilst the original cast is all but gone except for one, this movie i found really entertaining. lets not get too excited, you have to take it for the booby teen comedy that it is, but for what it is, it excels. the characters are likable and funny, the girls are hotter than hell. the fun and games are hilarious, with some stuff i've never seen before in comedies, they make me cringe but laugh at the same time.<br /><br />so ignore the haters and give this a run and see what you think. don't expect the classic american pie, but expect something that should make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so.
