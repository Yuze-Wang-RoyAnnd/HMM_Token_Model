on second viewing of this movie, i like it even more than the first time. it is full of nuances and a perception of life as being quite ordinary and often fearful but what lifts this movie to a height rarely realized is its focus on the little incidences in our lives to which we normally only offer the briefest of attention spans. here the movie spins into the celebration of these incidences, the meeting of a tow truck driver and client, the jogger hearing a baby's cry from the bushes. the dialogue, acting, casting and direction are superb. no two by fours, no grand revelations. what i did observe was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how enhanced their lives became when these were celebrated. kudos to all involved in this, we need more "grand canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
