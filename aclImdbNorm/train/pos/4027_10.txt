a very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam. urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best.<br /><br />there is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through. it looked like bollywood finally gave away it's glamor and had some quality artists performing on screen.<br /><br />content wise, the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in one's life goes beyond religion.<br /><br />the best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and melodrama.<br /><br />i simply loved it.
