at first i didn't didn't like it that much, although i did. they didn't include the third trueba generation, the love between blanca and pedro wans't well explained and some actors were too different from what i had imagined.<br /><br />later i realized that, had the movie been more loyal to the book, it would have been like five hours long, and would be kind of tedious. now i like it very much, because my favourite characters are there as i portraited them. clara really looks like an angel in live, and her introduction to the story at the beggining of the film was fantastic, loyal and short. glenn close is ferula. i pictured her just like that, only not in mourning throughout the whole thing. esteban is find enough. i never really liked his character, and, although i was interested in him, i hated him a lot, more specially when he hit clara. as in the book, the very last part is the most exciting one, and it has real history too there.<br /><br />the movie is really good, specially considering that it was a gringo film based upon a latin american book. its amazing how many famous stars are there, don't you think so?
