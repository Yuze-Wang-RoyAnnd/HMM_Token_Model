i grew up watching full house as a child. i stopped watching it for years, but about two weeks ago i started back watching it again. now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well. my kids can't believe that dj , on the show, and i are the same age.<br /><br />i really love the show, because it is a show you can watch with your family. it has good teachings your kids can learn from. also there isn't any drugs and violence on it. also when the kids, on the show, have a problem they can always open up to their family for help. that's the message kids should be getting from tv now a days, turn to your family for help, not to drugs. kids should be watching more shows like full house instead of half the mess on tv now a days.<br /><br />i also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth. it talks about real life problems and family matters. there is always a lesson you can learn from the show.<br /><br />i vote the show a 10.
