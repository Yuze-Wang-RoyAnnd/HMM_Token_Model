part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson (2 reasons enough to watch), was a period piece and involved chess. everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. i shan't, therefore, give away much more. suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strong-minded woman who is drawn to him. it's about love and obsession, rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour, became totally compelling. and i defy anyone to second-guess the ending.
