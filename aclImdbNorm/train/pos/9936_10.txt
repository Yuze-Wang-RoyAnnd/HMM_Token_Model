this was one of my favorite series when i was a kid. the swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of summers ago when i had just finished my first semester of medical school. i was surprised to see the depth in which the organs was explained. sure, some things are simplified but most of it was correct (even though it was made 22 years ago!) and quite understandable. i would suggest that all soon-to-be medical student should watch it. it is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example. now i'm in my 7th semester and i think i'll watch the series once again as soon as i've bought the dvd-box :-)
