clean family oriented movie. i laughed, i cried...i loved it. i was worried i wouldn't be able to see steve carrell as anything but goofy michael from the office. boy, was i wrong. he should win an oscar for his performance. i will definitely buy this on dvd when it comes out. my husband enjoyed it and he isn't into movies of this "type". i saw it with 2 other couples in the 30 year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest. only 1 cuss word! not even sure why it was pg13. i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!
