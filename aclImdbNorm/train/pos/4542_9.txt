centered in the downtown and out skirts of detroit, this comedy i found to be a terrific new comedic duo. 'noriyuki pat morita' is a very funny man, who happens to be a cop from japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the united states to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. pat's character collides with 'jay leno's' character, a fast talking' but down to business-player type detroit cop. when they cross paths though, the honorable 'ways' of japan meet the all-out old school detroit police investigative 'ways'. the two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, cold. after battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. a little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. i rated this a 9. lewis's direction makes' this a near perfect comedy. fun for all ages. i recommend it highly.(***)
