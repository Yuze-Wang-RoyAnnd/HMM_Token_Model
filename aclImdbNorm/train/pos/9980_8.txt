any movie that shows federal pigs (persons in government) to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me.<br /><br />alas, the script supervision and editing and even, at times, the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments.<br /><br />i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it, despised it, loathed it. thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk.<br /><br />now, though, i don't remember why.<br /><br />i believe the two should not be compared or even connected.<br /><br />consider them as two different movies.<br /><br />rate them as two different movies.<br /><br />this "vanishing point" provides a rallying place, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is, especially the federal government.<br /><br />"the voice" wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire: "live free or die." at one time it would have been the motto of most americans.<br /><br />despite its obvious flaws, "vanishing point" is a film to cheer.
