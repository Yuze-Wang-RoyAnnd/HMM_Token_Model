this is a reunion, a team, and a great episode of justice. from hesitation to resolution, clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny, to a superman who, like green arrow, sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones, ready to save the whole planet. this is not just a thrilling story about teamwork, loyalty, and friendship; this is also about deciding what's more important in life, a lesson for clark. i do not want the series to end, but i hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without any "rewind" pushes and put a good end here of smallville---and a wonderful beginning of superman.<br /><br />in this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between lex and the team. nine stars should give it enough credit.
