this was the best movie i've ever seen about bulimia. it hit the exact spot of what bulimia is really about and how it's not always about being skinny and dieting. it showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life, friends and themselves. the best line and the part that really shows what the problem with bulimia is, is when beth says,"it's not about you!" that line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. it showed that people with bulimia don't have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else. it has to do with them and them only. it shows that it's time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves. it showed that beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom's attention at that time the most.
