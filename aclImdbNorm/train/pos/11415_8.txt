this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend. my friend and i both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store. we had to get it. with no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night. i would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie.
