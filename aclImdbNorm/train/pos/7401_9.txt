i found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators, i.e. chinese. it becomes a story about values, and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life, and loyalties toward institutions. amazingly enough, it managed to do this in a gentle, mildly humorous manner, which only in retrospect seens threatening to one's status quo. i enjoyed the movie, and would watch it again if i could.
