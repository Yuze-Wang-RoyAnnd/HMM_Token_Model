i don't think this movie is for everyone. but i saw it this weekend in seattle and i thought it was so funny. i haven't laughed that hard during a movie in long time. i thought the entire cast did a great job. you will find yourself laughing from the first moment through the very last scene. i suspect some moviegoers (especially the ones who take themselves way too seriously) will be turned off by this brand of humor. not me. the movie was a real surprise. and the entire theater was rolling with laughter throughout the showing i went to which makes me think that a lot of people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change. i cannot wait to see it again! if you're in the mood to lol then this is for you. funny funny funny funny!
