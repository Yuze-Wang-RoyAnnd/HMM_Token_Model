i don't like "grade inflation" but i just had to give this a 10. i can't think of anything i didn't like about it. i saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it. i'm sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about, with j lo and richard gear, will be excellent, but this original japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that i am hard-pressed to think of any way that it could be improved, or its setting changed to a different culture.<br /><br />a story i found worth watching, and with o fist-fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort! imagine that!<br /><br />all the characters seemed well-developed, ... even non-primary characters had good character-development and enjoyable acting, and the casting seemed very appropriate. <br /><br />it's always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age, and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify (there is plenty of learning how to dance, but no singing) but i really think that gene kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in japan, looking for something... he knows not precisely what.<br /><br />to the team of people in japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it.
