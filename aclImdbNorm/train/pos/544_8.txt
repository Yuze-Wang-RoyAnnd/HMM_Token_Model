i loved this movie. it was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women, he kills men also. and the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly, when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberly's last moments before she is thrown to the water, and secondly, when stanley is visiting allison in his basement, right before they head down to the set, when she kisses him. those scenes, for me, were very intense and riveting. i gave the movie a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, i mean, there were times when you'd notice nothing was wrong, like its being shot the way a film is usually shot, you wouldn't see the "live" camera shooting, but then, very little, you would notice the filming mistakes. what went wrong??
