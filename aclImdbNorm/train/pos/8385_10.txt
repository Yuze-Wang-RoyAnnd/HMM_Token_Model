this film seems to get bad critiscism for some reason. probably just by the mass populace. anyhow, this is actually a very interesting movie. the film is an under-budget sci-fi movie which actually works, due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes. <br /><br />this movie may not be for everyone though. if there are any sci-fi fans reading this, i truly recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction. the film has crazy ideas. the setting includes nations going to war with gigantic machines which the entire countries invest all it's money in! the world has been divied up into territories. anyone can challenge anyone else to a war, or rather, a 'robot-duel'. the method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war, since now everyone is wearing those breath masks. definetly a movie that makes you think. intelligent, well written, and good effects for the measly budget.<br /><br />i tend to like movies which have small budgets and actually work.
