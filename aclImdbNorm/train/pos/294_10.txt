a critical and financial flop when first release, the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the director's best. a la ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency (ben gazzara, john ritter and blaine novak) persue, fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film (audrey hepburn, colleen camp, dorothy stratten and patti hansen). much of the script was ad-libbed or re-written on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel. ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn after dropping singer colleen camp and seeing cab-driver patti hansen on the side. john ritter ineptly follows dorothy stratten and immediately falls in love with her. blaine novak has a few girls he is chasing (including joyce hyser and elizabeth pena). this film has some great performances by a supurb cast. standouts are audrey hepburn (she doesn't have a line in the first half of the film). ben gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead) and colleen camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer christy miller. she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a rat-a-tat-tat delivery. highly recommended! ********* stars!
