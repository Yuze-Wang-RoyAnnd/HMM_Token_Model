i rate this 10 out of 10. why?<br /><br />* it offers insight into something i barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * buried in the movie is a great history of surfing; i have never surfed, but i love surfing movies, and have seen many. none taught me what this movie did * the movie was very well edited. it flowed well. the interviews were outstanding * it's interesting from start to finish<br /><br />in summary, it's about as good as a documentary as i have seen, so i have to rate in terms of that. so 10/10
