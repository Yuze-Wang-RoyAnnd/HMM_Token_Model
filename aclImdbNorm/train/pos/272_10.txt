loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager.the movie, was presented well, with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing. many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter. the progression of situations were cleverly written,making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious. too bad there have to be commercials.i have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view again.i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue. husband and wife heated discussions(or should i say fights?) were very realistic.the initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not.i want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film. thank you! looking forward to the next films---when? whidbey
