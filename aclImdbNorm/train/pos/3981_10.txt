this is my fourth joe mcdoakes short that i've seen and so far the funniest one. in this one, joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating charles boyer and ronald colman. when he goes to warner bros. studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks jack carson for directions which gets both confused. then he encounters actor george o'hanlon (who's also mcdoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later geroge jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director. i'll stop there and just say how funny i found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end. the final scene was especially a hoot so on that note, go to youtube if you want to watch so you want to be in picutres!
