la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects. true, the actors don't "act" ... true, they talk a lot... but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living... or dying. the very long monologue spoken by francoise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood, manhood and love. not easy to translate accurately, though. this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). and imho, jean pierre l'eaud is one of the greatest french actors.
