ok. i'm biased. i live near shrewsbury in england, where this wonderful movie was filmed. it still looks the same now. i remember them filming here quite vividly, and the fake snow on the streets for days on end. often, when i'm walking through shrewsbury i see a street or a house and it will remind me of this film.<br /><br />george c. scott's scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions. his physical appearance isn't the typical miser. scott's is big and imposing. a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferior.<br /><br />we all know the story and the quotes. the book is one of the most cherished works in the english language. and i don't believe there are many cynics who would say that people aren't capable of change and redemption. this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully. george c. scott may be american but he plays the part of the english miser with wonderful skill.<br /><br />i love this movie. if you haven't seen this version i would strongly urge that you do. it's usually available for a very small amount of money... or are you too mean?
