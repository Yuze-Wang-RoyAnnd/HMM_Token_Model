walter pidgeon is braley mason, a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in "the unknown man," a 1951 film also starring ann harding, barry sullivan, keefe braselle, and richard anderson. a great believer in justice, pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man, rudi walchek (braselle) accused of murder and gets him acquitted. shortly afterward, he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood. he is advised by the da (sullivan) that rudi is small change, that to wipe out the organized crime, one has to find the top man. mason finds the top man, and is faced with a dilemma.<br /><br />"the unknown man" is a small, black and white film that manages to hold the viewer's interest with its various plot twists, though the plot is somewhat contrived. it's really the story of a good man seeking his god, justice, and what he is willing to do in order to attain it. and that's the most contrived part of all. i suppose there was a time before o.j., the menendez brothers, etc., etc., when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys. for this viewer anyway, those days are long over.<br /><br />walter pidgeon does an excellent job -- his handsome, elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful, confident man but also a deeply caring one. pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years but never really rose to superstardom. he was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did. it may be because by the time he was getting leads, he was well into his thirties and missed being a matin'ee idol; or it could be he lacked that certain something; or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like greer garson. hard to say. he gives an honest and touching performance here.<br /><br />very good movie with good performances.
