this review is for the extended cut of this movie.<br /><br />i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago. i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea.<br /><br />that being said. i've always found the storyline a bit confusing. the movie is, after all, a love story. and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene.<br /><br />well, in the extended version this is no longer so. the old "original" version begins off with a huge barrel-climb/rugby-like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version. the opening sequence is dragon(jackie chan) hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around.<br /><br />other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it. the pacing is also better and overall it just works better. it feels more like a love story and doesn't leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does.<br /><br />i suggest everyone who is a hong-kong cinema, or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended.(or at least that's how i think it was intended. why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes) when i was done watching it, i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same.
