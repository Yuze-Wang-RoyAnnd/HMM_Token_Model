it's a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the us. i found it through a rare video dealer, and it was certainly worth it. this is, without a doubt, the best film made during the pre-code era, and the finest film of the 1930s. masterful director frank borzage made wonderful films about the depression, and with man's castle he created a fairy tale amidst the hardships of the era.<br /><br />loretta young and spencer tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them, and they help make this movie a wonderful romance. young's trina is sweet and hopeful, while tracy's bill is gruff and closed-off. the dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult, but in the end rewarding relationships on film.<br /><br />man's castle is the most soft-focus pre-code film i've seen. borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique to turn the squatter's village where bill and trina live into a palace. the hardships of the depression are never ignored, in fact they're integral to the film. but as borzage crafts the film as a soft focus fairy tale, the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh. it makes the film warm and affectionate.<br /><br />man's castle is the crowning achievement of the pre-code era. if only more people could see it.
