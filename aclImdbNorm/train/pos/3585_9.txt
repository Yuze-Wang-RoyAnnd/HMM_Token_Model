excellent story about teenagers, leaders, high school football "stars". how far will you go to protect your friends? lie, kill? how much can you lose if you stud by an innocent girl? can love beat the odds? can you defeat narrow-minded small town people? when your friend scores and you "lose", will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it, or will you be a man about it, and respect her right to chose? will you rape her and show it as your victory over a "problem" girl? can you stand by the one who's only sin is to have an opinion of her own, to be able to make her own decisions, to chose for herself? it made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong, but one is for sure - very disturbing movie and theme in general. thumb up!
