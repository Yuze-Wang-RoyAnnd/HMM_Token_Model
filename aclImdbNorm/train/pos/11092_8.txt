52-pick up never got the respect it should have. it works on many levels, and has a complicated but followable plot. the actors involved give some of their finest performances. ann-margret, roy scheider, and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals. notable too are vanity, who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows, and kelly preston, who's character will haunt you for a few days. anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this.
