this movie pretty much surprised me. i didn't have very high expectations for it but i was wrong. mary & rhoda was very funny and well written. they didn't spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren't relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie. overall it was very entertaining.<br /><br />my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit-com and i think i might agree with her.
