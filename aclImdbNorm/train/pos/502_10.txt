ok, so, this is coming a few weeks late, but it is here. mostly, this is because of statements of various negative natures. starting with the technology. when star trek: tos ran, special effect technology was extreamely low tec, and more than that, the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups. in the 35 years seince tos premiered, the crew of star trek have become experts at economy.<br /><br />ultimately, they have decided, quite rightly in my mind, to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all. so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii? as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire, it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon's in 2200. nothing was firmly established.<br /><br />enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while. this is what voyager could have been. no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies, but be thankful that star trek has so few. so, quit gripping and enjoy.
