this is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses. from the time they walk in, to the time hardy just falls off the roof, this keeps me laughing hysterically. i highly suggest that every fan of laurel and hardy should see this short. i also recommend all of the ghost series. if you are looking for laughs, see this movie and you will be happy.
