i love buying those cheap, lousy dvd's from alpha video. one day, i happened to buy this one. it's the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50's, all sexed up. replete with unscientific everything, scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama, it's an enjoyable film, to those who appreciate this kind of stuff. and if you can 'suspend your disbelief' enough, you can actually get creeped out-- not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet, but toward the end, with the character of 'the perfect body'. it's so . . . . what's another word for mindf***ing?
