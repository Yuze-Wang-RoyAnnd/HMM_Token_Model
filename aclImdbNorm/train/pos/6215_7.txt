while i am not a big fan of musicals, i have loved the films of fred astaire and ginger rogers because they are just so much fun. sure, they can be a bit formulaic, but even though you know what is going to happen, they still are very pleasing to watch. however, despite this, i was a bit disappointed in this outing. part of it was because this film doesn't have the wonderful supporting cast like you saw in top hat or shall we dance. without edward everett horton or eric blore, the film seems to be a bit lacking--especially in the "fun" department. the silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films charm that you just don't get with follow the fleet. in addition, unlike the usual character played by astaire, this one is more of a jerk--as his fat head gets rogers into trouble again and again. and, as a result, it's a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film. plus, although the music is by irving berlin, the songs just don't seem as memorable. in fact, none of the songs were all that special and i can't recall any of them even though i just saw the movie. while this is still a cute and worthwhile film, it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other films. good but far from great.
