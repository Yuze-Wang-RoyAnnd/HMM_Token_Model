i admit i have a weakness for alternate history stories, from its a wonderful life to groundhog day to 12:01. among those greats is this little gem. it's pretty difficult to get through mr. destiny without giving a nod of appreciation to each and every cast member, from the goodhearted james belushi to the murderous courtney cox. this movie lacks the gravitas and scale to make it a great film, but it's a fine cheer-up on a rainy afternoon. it's also a great rental for an inexpensive date.
