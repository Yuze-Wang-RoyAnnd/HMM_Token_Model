the bourne ultimatum - jason bourne (matt damon in his best role ever), the newest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cia's latest program "blackbriar" to make super assassins like himself.<br /><br />i was so psyched for this one that i watched it's predecessors yesterday and today. identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak (but still enjoyable) link in the chain for the weakest plot and, aside from a car chase which this film's chase easily tops, slight lacking in action and suspense.<br /><br />hoo boy, does ultimatum have suspense! even when you know bourne will escape the authorities (and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept), it's still brilliant watching him do it. it's mind-boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those $150 million giant robots did in transformers.<br /><br />chalk it up to paul greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary, even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like cia headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder. he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy, as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than awe-inspiring, with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick, a hardcover book (i'll never look at those the same way again) and an electric fan (don't ask). the music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over.<br /><br />the acting is good, and the evolution of julia stiles' character "nicky" put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light. damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity. this longing of his for a real life could get boring, and almost did in supremacy, but just works better in ultimatum (better script). <br /><br />i am reminded of a scene in "goldeneye" (the only good pierce brosnan bond film) in which sean bean's character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he's killed. bourne regrets all the people he killed, and he considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning, and how the government has transformed men into resources. albeit, resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anything.<br /><br />sidenote: it's always bothered me that, despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia, interpol, and the police nearly anywhere he goes, that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports. sunglasses maybe? <br /><br />if you have a pulse and love action movies, than bourne ultimatum is for you. hell, it's probably the best action film to come out this year. of course, you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first. it kind of drags a touch near the end, but i almost feel tempted to overlook that. this is the first "3" movie this summer to at least match, if not exceed, the original and that is saying something.<br /><br />a-
