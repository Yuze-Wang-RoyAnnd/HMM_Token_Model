this is an extremely dense, somber, and complicated film that unravels quite slowly, revealing excruciating detail, like the attention paid in a novel, and watching this film "is" like watching a novel unfold. while i didn't care for the narrator, as i felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances, this film features some of the best ensemble acting i have ever seen, and the lead, summer phoenix, is fabulous. her innocence and naivete some might find implausible, sort of a cross between cinderella and alice in wonderland. i can buy that critique, but she's still fabulous, partially because she's unlike anything i've ever seen before.<br /><br />this film is unbelievably beautiful, filmed by eric gautier, and part of what is so unique about this film is how it doesn't ever show what you'd expect. it's always surprising, and despite it's length, the film never reveals more than it needs to. at 163 minutes, it's extremely concise, to a fault, i'd say, which is one of the wonders of this film. it's filled with brief moments which are simply stunning, some of the best you're likely to see all year, and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience. the family moments are unique, ian holm is brilliant, and what this film has to say about the theater hasn't been seen in films since cassavetes' "opening night," or perhaps chaplin's "limelight." but, believe it or not, this film is much "less" conventional. i never knew where this film was going, and now, having seen it, it still has multiple possibilities. this is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.
