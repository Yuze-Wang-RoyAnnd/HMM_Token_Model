i enjoyed this film. it was funny, cute, silly, and entertaining. had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that i truly don't understand. no, it wasn't "the grapes of wrath" or "casablanca" or even "moonstruck", but it was an enjoyable film.<br /><br />julia was excellent playing the psychotic 'man behind the man'. the story is a little silly to be sure, but it this isn't high drama, folks. i happened to see a review of the film, probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie. i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it, and i'm glad i saw it. eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile, and i watch it a couple times a year.
