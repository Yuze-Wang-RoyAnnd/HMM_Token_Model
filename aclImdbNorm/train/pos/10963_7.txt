i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill, jackie kennedy's sister and the cousin of these women, would encourage the maysles' to make "big edie" and "little edie" the subject of a film. they certainly could be considered the "skeletons" in the family closet. the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women. i'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating. (i.e. "are they nuts? or am i missing something?"). this movie is hard to come by. netflix does not have it. facets does, though.
