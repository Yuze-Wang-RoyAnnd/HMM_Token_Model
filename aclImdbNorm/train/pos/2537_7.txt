boris and bela do well together in this film,whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat.i saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from borders this year. this time watching it with my children,i took note of 2 things: it held the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and i caught a few things i hadn't when i first watched it.very swift story with an unpredictable end. a must for movie buffs!!!
