when people think of downtown chicago they think of walter payton, ditka and "da bears", ryne sandberg, the white sox breaking the curse in 2005 or the immortal michael jordan and his six championships (and finals mvp's) with the chicago bulls. rarely in this generation do people think of the struggling side of chicago, the ghettos, the drug infested streets and life in the urban housing projects during the 1970's.<br /><br />one of television's most formidable shows ever and a groundbreaking sitcom was "good times", which i remember vaguely as a small child on cbs, and i enjoy regularly now on tv land.<br /><br />"good times" was another norman lear classic, the producer that gave us "the jeffersons", the best african american sitcom of all time and "all in the family" the greatest show of all time. "good times" brought out the hardships of the ghetto and the urban housing projects, and did so with charm, well written and thoughtful plots, and some wonderful acting especially by the matriarch and patriarch of this struggling ghetto family played by esther rolle and john amos. the children in the supporting cast were also pretty good especially the ever popular janet jackson in her early years and ralph carter as florida and james evans youngest son whose character at a young age realizes that life is unfair, and he has to learn to stand on his own two feet.<br /><br />the eldest of the children j.j. played by jimmy walker is somewhat out of place on this show and is there mainly for comic relief. his emotional age is about 11 or 12 even though he looks like a guy in his early twenties. j.j. gets annoying, and it is a credit to the often nasty james evans (amos) that he never tells j.j. to get his own life, get a job and get out of the house. j.j. is an aspiring painter but unlike his younger brother is never serious about getting a college degree, or more important to the family getting a job to help support a household that is just above welfare status.<br /><br />two classic episodes of good times was the one where the janet jackson character is running a fever of 104, and florida evans is desperately seeking good medical help for her can't afford anything but a clinic doctor who is very professional yet doesn't want to give a family from the projects any more attention than she legally has to. the other episode is the one where james evans can't afford the rent a paltry low $104 a month. the evans are about to get the largest of family setbacks, being thrown out of the projects with no where to go. florida evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a loan or a grant to help her family. but the government doesn't consider her family poor because they have over $4,200 in assets for a family of five which is unfairly but unfortunately legally over the poverty line. james and the kids want to hustle for the money, but florida is a person of great moral character and doesn't want to do anything dishonest no matter how dire their predicament is. in the end the family does find a solution to keep their heads above water.<br /><br />"good times" a classic show from the 1970's is about keeping you're head above water in a cruel world. james and florida evans both work hard in menial jobs to try to bring their children up right and avoid the social stigma of welfare. i was too young to understand the message of the sitcom as a toddler in the 70s in its first airing on cbs, but i really enjoy the reruns on tv land in 2006. "good times" is one of the classic sitcoms from back in the day.
