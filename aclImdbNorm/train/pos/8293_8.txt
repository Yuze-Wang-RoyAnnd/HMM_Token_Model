as a 90 minute experience, it is not up to the standard of `drive', as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the `who am i?' academy, while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark dacascos beat 'em-up. however, those who enjoyed `drive', (and i thought it was wonderful!), will undoubtedly enjoy this too. you certainly won't rewind back to the start and watch it all again, but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come.<br /><br /> it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced, even if not in hong kong, and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets, time and respect afforded to the likes of yuen woo-ping and corey yuen kuei. if you sit through the first half hour and aren't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat. bosch is magnificent, and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics, kicks and simple acts of bravery.<br /><br /> if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy, then track it down and watch it. it's not shakespeare. in fact, it's less articulate than coolio in `china strike force', but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team - (i'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on your head, or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car!?).<br /><br />
