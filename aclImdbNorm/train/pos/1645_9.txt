this western is done in a different manner than most others. realism is the key here. conchata farrell comes to wyoming to work for rip torn on his ranch. how this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of americana. i would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape, but it's worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west. cinematography is excellent. solid 9. torn & farrell excel in this movie.
