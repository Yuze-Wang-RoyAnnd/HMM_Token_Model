i grew up in houston and was nine when this movie came out. as a result i don't remember anything about the movie. but i do remember the sensation it caused from gilley's and the mechanical bull to johnny lee's hit song "lookin' for love" which still brings back memories of childhood whenever i hear it.<br /><br />however, a few years ago i saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all i can say is, i was blown away. few movies have hit me harder. this movie is as raw and real as you can get. from uncle bob's ranch house, the chemical plant in texas city, gilley's dance hall, and bud and sissy. and maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal. but no matter how you feel about country music (i for one can't stand it despite my houston roots) urban cowboy is a unique slice of american pie. for that reason i love it!
