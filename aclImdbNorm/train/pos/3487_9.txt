wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great wrestlemania's but i would personally put it, in my top 5, if not the top 3. it has so many great things, and it truly signified the birth of the attitude era, which was wwe's best era, in my opinion. hbk has the heart of a lion, and him putting over austin like he did, on his way out, was pure class on his part. it has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see, and it has j.r and the king at their announcing best!. <br /><br />matches.<br /><br />15
