i saw two movies over the weekend, one was "kaal" and the other "waqt". both movies are made in "bollywood" but they are worlds apart. the fundamental difference is the story and the director. vipul shaw made his indelible mark with "ankhen", one of the best comedy hindi movies. his casting of the charecteres is perfect. the story apparently taken from a gujerati play is awesome,the treatment is superb with some exceptions. in bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a bollywood director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy (mediocre malik in this instance)is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract. so even a good director like vipul shah has to use them to appease the finacier and the grandma's who just cant get enough of these numbers. no music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie. none of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the bharat-natyam. the duelling and role playing the father and son is good acting by bachachan and akshay kumar. his stunt scenes are clearly outstanding. a good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie. then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer like sharukh khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like "kaal" to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of art, and they surround themselves with borderline talent, and they recoup the investment before the word gets around. these are the bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner "film farce" awards given by bollywood chamcha's and most of them are in the media.
