who made this film? i love this film? somebody has a wacky sense of humor...<br /><br />this zany, surreal style of film making is appealing, but it is hard to create - or easy to forget - that substance, and characters who actually have souls, are what give such a film depth. without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. who cares. it may get laughs, but it goes through you like a half-good hamburger...next...<br /><br />crosseyed may not intend to change anybody's life, but i appreciate the depth and substance. they sneak up on you. i started this film thinking "oh, i get it - indie comedy - off the wall - gonzo...yup." and it is that - but if you pay attention there is sub text and character moments filling it out. in this sense the film breathes. it makes propositions that give pause - if you're available to see them - and then, of course, it goes on its insanely merry way.<br /><br />you will miss the point if you don't sign the contract to suspend belief at moments in the film. stepping between reality and surreality is one of the points of this movie.<br /><br />crosseyed isn't perfect, but smart people made it. i want more.<br /><br />the dining room scenes are an absolute hoot.<br /><br />put on your seat belt.
