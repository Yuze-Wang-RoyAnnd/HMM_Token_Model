star pickford and director tourneur -- along with his two favorite cameramen and assistant clarence brown doing the editing -- bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor, isolated scottish islanders -- the same territory that michael powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success. visions of wind and wave, sunbacked silhouettes of lovers do not merely complement the story, they are the story of struggle against hardship.<br /><br />the actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan, wavering between comedy and thoughtfulness, here with her father's bullwhip lashing wayward islanders to church, there seated with her guest's walking stick in her hand like a scepter, discussing her lover, played by matt moore.<br /><br />see if you can pick out future star leatrice joy in the ensemble. i tried, but failed.
