i voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time. the animation is stunning. the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful. from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry. i was amazed. moving beyond the beauty on the screen, you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh. character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand. i'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family.
