some of the acting was a bit suspect. i remember that asswipe alexander walker (evening standard critic, yeah ok, he's now dead) launched into a rant about this film saying it was a disgrace portraying ni protestants as murderers. now with respect to all ni protestants, this film was loosely based on the shankill butchers (who were loyalists)and who roamed belfast in the 1970's. believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing. my main moan about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope, it's all doom & gloom, i mean did the little girl at the end have to die. maybe this sounds corny but it could have taken the tact that not all prods & tiags are bad or wholly good either.
