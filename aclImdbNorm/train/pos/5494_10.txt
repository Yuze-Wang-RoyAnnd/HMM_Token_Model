with part reconstruction and part direct shooting, the directors made a formidably limpid documentary on a coup d''etat against president chavez in venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the wealthy venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the church (a cynical laughing cardinal) and the us government. it was another chapter in the history of us foreign policy, which steven kinzer calls 'overthrow' or 'sowing democracy american style'. in fact, this foreign backed intervention was not only a coup d''etat against president chavez, but also against the democratic majority which elected him. <br /><br />that this is a brilliant documentary is mightily confirmed by the violent reactions for and against it on internet. as saint augustine said: 'men love truth when it bathes them in its light; they hate it when it proves them wrong.'<br /><br />this movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.
