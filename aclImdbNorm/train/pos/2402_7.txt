the main reason to see this film is warren william, who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager. he is electric, constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters. william is a great actor -- i feel he never got his due. bette davis as his girlfriend also shines in an under-written role. personally, i found guy kibbee not quite right as the lame-brained candidate that william and the others are trying to foist on the public. he seemed more like an empty canvas than a person. i would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a non-character. the story itself is implausible, silly and clich'ed. but warren william and bette davis are well worth watching.
