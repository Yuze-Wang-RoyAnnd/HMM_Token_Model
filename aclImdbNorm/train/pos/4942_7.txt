i have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie i was basically lost. there had been some mildly amusing humour, but at best a barebones plot and a general sense of pointlessness that was on the verge of making me think that i was wasting my time. then - for no apparent reason - i suddenly realized that i was enjoying this. there was no blinding moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene that grabbed me. in fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire movie. it was as if i just all of a sudden realized that the movie was meant to be largely pointless - and that in its very pointlessness was its charm.<br /><br />morgan freeman starred as an unnamed actor who finds a "little project" to jumpstart his career. he's going to play a supermarket manager, and spends the day in a neighbourhood supermarket to research the role. while there he meets and bonds with scarlet (played by paz vega) - a cashier who wants more out of life. he helps her prepare for a job interview as if she's auditioning for a role, while she introduces him to real life. it's truly funny watching "him" (for that's how the character is identified in the credits) be overwhelmed by a visit to the local target store.<br /><br />freeman and vega were great together, with a strange but completely believable sort of combined romantic but father-daughter chemistry. if you feel lost at the beginning, stick with this. in the end, it turns out to be a delightfully charming movie. 7/10
