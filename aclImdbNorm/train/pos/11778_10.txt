this series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. it brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author's subsequent opus, *collapse*.<br /><br />diamond himself comes off as personable and caring, not just a disinterested or disengaged academic. this series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to "publish or perish," as the saying goes about academe, but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects, "why you white people got so much cargo, and we have so little?" because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, diamond looked for an answer that didn't insult that intelligence or that community. i like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as "south park's" "blame canada": "blame wheat!"
