sure, 65 years have passed since thalberg's last production was filmed. but fellow imdb members, come on, this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30's! it is a 10.<br /><br />this was the first movie i saw at new york's museum of modern art, around 1970 (i was a teenager). expensive looking yet with scenes of such poverty, masterfully photographed, often thrilling, and always engaging, to me it was mgm movie-making at its best. what did audiences feel when they glimpsed a locust attack, the person by person destruction of a mansion, the horrific poverty and then the splendor of wealth.<br /><br />last week, those watching the academy awards had a glimpse of the "senior" oscar winner in attendance, luise rainer. how grand to see an actress who arguably delivered one of the most masterful, haunting performances in history electing to return for a celebration.<br /><br />ok, so she should not have won the year before (great ziegfeld), but don't blame luise. talkies were only a decade old when this was released, and her dialogue limited. but as olan, her use of visual and vocal is memorable.<br /><br />large scale and touching, what more could a movie lover want!
