kenneth branagh's "hamlet" hits all the marks. the acting is magnificent, the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous, the oscar-nominated costumes and sets are stunning, and patrick doyle's score (also oscar-nominated) is sensitive and moving. oh yeah - the screenplay, by some guy named will s., isn't too bad either. film critics ribbed branagh for receiving the films' fourth oscar nod for "adapting" the screenplay, but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one. i can't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by.<br /><br />nearly every decision branagh makes works brilliantly: the use of england's blenheim palace for exteriors, the edwardian dress, and the staging of "to be or not to be" in a hall of mirrors, to name a few. the casting of hollywood luminaries such as robin williams, billy crystal and jack lemmon in minor parts can be distracting, but that's nitpicking. the principal cast excels: derek jacobi captures the conflicted nature of claudius; kate winslet acutely depicts ophelia's descent into madness; julie christie brings passion to her portrayal of gertrude; richard briers is pitch-perfect as the conniving polonius; and nicholas farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship. every speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there isn't a wasted moment in the entire film. the final scenes magnify the extent of shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations.<br /><br />branagh's "hamlet" is a bold, ambitious, and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of shakespeare's language with equally eloquent imagery. it's arguably the greatest shakespearean adaptation ever filmed
