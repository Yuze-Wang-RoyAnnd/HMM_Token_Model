as a massive fan of fantasy in general, and of the works of neil gaiman *in particular*, i've been looking forward to this film so avidly, so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that i can scarcely believe it's finally here. and you know what? i needn't have feared, the film version is bl**dy awesome. different from the book, but in a good way - less whimsical, more comical, still deeply sweet and enchanting.<br /><br />the special effects are absolutely spot-on, and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive.<br /><br />proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing, and the casting in the main is a triumph, with the ghostly princes (whose roll-call read almost as a "who's who" of currently cool british comedy - rupert everett, david walliams of little britain fame, two of the blokes from green wing etc) stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films' funniest moments, which exist in abundance. <br /><br />in fact, the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little ott, subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story.... ricky gervais' cameo, for example, was far too much just "ricky gervais doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona" for my liking, and in my opinion, created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story (though in fairness, from memory i believe the ferdy character in the original book was pretty "ricky gervais"-esquire when i think back on it)....<br /><br />but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance. charlie cox, as the protagonist tristan, captures the correct mixture of naivety, subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a "humble young boy embarks on life-changing quest"; claire danes as yvaine is beautiful, feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal, a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; robert de niro, in the cameo every reviewer is talking about, is indeed deserving of praise, rollicking good fun (looks like he's having a ball, too)... and michelle pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch lamia, my favourite performance of the film overall. if you enjoyed her deliciously b!tchy performance in the recent "hairspray" then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this, too.<br /><br />so to round off this review: you will laugh, for sure, you will smile, and you may even cry - stardust is a beautiful, heart-warming fairytale for all the family, with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent. one of my all-time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride, and stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory.... and just as the princess bride remains fresh, smart and funny twenty years after its initial release, i believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions (or equivalent future device!) for many years to come.
