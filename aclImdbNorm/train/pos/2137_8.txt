this is far more than the charming story of middle-aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing (although it is that as well). it's the tale of one person learning to love life again, pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more. the bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact. there are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... a few where you'll want to get up and tango ... and many others where you'll just feel good.<br /><br />this is a great introduction to contemporary japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all japanese movies are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /><br />
