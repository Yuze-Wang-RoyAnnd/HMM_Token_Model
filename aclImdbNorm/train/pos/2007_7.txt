my personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first john carpenter's vampires but i don't care i loved it. jon bon jovi (derek) was great in this movie. he really mad me believe that he was the person you would never think he was a famous rockstar. there were some bad things about this movie. like the story line,there should have been more to the movie.there should have been a sequel to the movie that followed the movies story line and they should have kept the same main characters in all three vampires movies. i really liked the clothes that the people wore and the setting they pick in mexico. i liked how it was old mexico and not new mexico. with the clay houses and the old fashion churches. i was a little confused with the vampires and how they were able to walk in churches but it was cool how they didn't follow dracula vampire rules.
