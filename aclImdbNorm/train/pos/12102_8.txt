this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalist...poe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle. well, of course he can, but will he come out unscathed? hard to say with all these strange people that aren't supposed to be there wandering around, including the icy barbara steele. this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english, and switches back and forth a few times. perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost? it's also rather dark and claustrophobic, being that one doesn't see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate, plus there's a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times. this version (on synapse) is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from 1964 until i saw the topless scene, i guess that might be it. overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white. barbara steele definitely makes the movie too. 8 out of 10.
