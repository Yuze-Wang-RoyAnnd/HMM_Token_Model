so often a band will get together for a re-union concert only to find that they just can't get it together. not so here. this concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish. these three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone's ego. this is obvious from the start, before they even step on stage. many faces in the crowd weren't even born when these guys first performed. from the first song they capture that old magic that was cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no fuss. clapton, by his own admission, said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best. ginger baker demonstrates why so many drummers today, speak of him as some sort of drumming guru. jack bruce just great. they really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come. this one's a 10 for me.
