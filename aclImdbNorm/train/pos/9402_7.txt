i saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years. needless to say, the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic. but still, alec guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly, if formulaic, romp through industrial post-wwii england.<br /><br />this is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product. remember the car that runs on water? remember the promise of nuclear energy? in this case, it's a fabric that doesn't wear out, wrinkle, or even get dirty! of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business, and so the plot gets a bit thick.<br /><br />guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile, and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast! (those brits ... always the stiff upper lip when under fire.) the film might chug along exactly like guiness's goofy invention, but it's a good ride all the same.
