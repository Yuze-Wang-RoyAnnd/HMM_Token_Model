can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal, which was to correctly adapt allende's novel? obviously yes. bille august managed to make a superficial, shallow film where basic elements of south american mentality are presented simply as side events, resulting in total incoherency. i can't believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! there is of course technical quality in this film and i think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands, but something is missing. and this something was the most important part.
