this is a very entertaining flick, considering the budget and its length. the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty. the acting was great (p'z to dom) and the cinematography was also very well done. i recommend this movie for anyone who's into thrillers, it will not disappoint you!
