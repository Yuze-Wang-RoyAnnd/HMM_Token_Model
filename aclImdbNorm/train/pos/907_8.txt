this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western ones.its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around.shahid kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with amrita rao who is also very desi and she also acts pretty well...the genre of the movie is the same as hahk and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional values...the movies doesn't get 10 as it isn't very good at music which counts a lot in every movie,besides this it is flawless....
