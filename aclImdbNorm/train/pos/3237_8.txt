following my experience of finland for slightly more than a week, i'd say this movie depicts the nature of the finnish society very accurately. especially the young-couple-with-a-baby-having-serious-issues phenomenon is very familiar to me, as i witnessed the exact same thing in person when i was in finland. the relationships and problems of people, fragility of the marriage institution, the drinking culture, unemployment and the ascending money problem, all are very well put, without any subjectivity or exaggeration.<br /><br />there are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other, but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding. not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound, but as said above, the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of "real life" and captivate the viewer. i happen to think in a calm moment: what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street? well, this is what is happening. movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power. it would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries, but it particularly reflects finland as it is, and pretty damn well.<br /><br />one comment about the acting: being the fan of finnish cinema i am, i've never seen any of these actors on any other movie, but i found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall. maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good try by the entire crew. i'll be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast..<br /><br />7,5 / 10
