i have enjoyed criminal intent series of law and order for a long time. kathryn erbe, det. alexandra eames, the female detective is rather hard and seems a bit bitter in the criminal intent series. see her other side in this movie.<br /><br />this movie shows the marvelous soft side of this talented actresses and if you are a criminal intent fan this movie is a revelry in her acting and you get a pretty darn good yarn of family hardships in the south.<br /><br />i did not like albert finneys role in this movie because he did such a convincing acting job of the older southern fellow that is hard headed and intolerant and unaccepting of change. he reminds me of so many men from my youth and the portrayal is divine, but you will likely find him hard to like in this movie.<br /><br />katryn erbe is easy to like in this movie and why i recommend it as a 10 star for criminal intent, law and order fans.
