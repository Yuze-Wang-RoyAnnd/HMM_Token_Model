strange enough, all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over. i feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work, since marina vlady was also robert hossein's wife, and the - excellent - jazz music was written by te director's father, andr'e. under these circumstances, no wonder it was a really good thriller, seen when issued and immediately identified with the music. the suspense was flawless, and maintained throughout until the end. robert hossein, at the time one of the best european players, managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director. he's still putting up great stage shows, with a preference for religious subjects.harry carasso, paris, france
