i didn't expect to like this film as much as i did. i got it simply because i saw it on the list of top 25 most controversial films of all time. it didn't look particularly great. i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memory.<br /><br />it's about a twenty-year-old woman wants to know everything. she stores every bit of information she collects in an enormous archive. she experiments with experience in sex, political activism, and human relationships. meanwhile, film's crew is shown making the film and we view their reactions to the story and each other. nudity, explicit sex, and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in the us while its seizure by customs was appealed. the film is a narrative yet it's a documentary that shows us the behind-the- scenes world of the filmmakers during the narrative, the fourth wall being broken. this film is the most direct possible way of making a movie i have ever seen. the movie predominantly works as a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic goings-on, freedom-fighting and sexual liberation. i like to think of it as much more than that.<br /><br />i didn't think i would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but i actually really do. this film is a buried treasure. give it a try.
