after growing up in the gritty streets of detroit, mi, and having friends who traveled to new york balls, i fell into the lifestyle of being a house member. i joined the house of theieves. we adapted the same rules as most houses, but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired. i even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver's license and cash them in over seventeen states, until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and i went to federal prison. but, i learned a lot from these queens in this movie and i highly recommend you watch it yourself. you can even read about how i grew up in the houses here in detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in. my book, identity schemes is available on sale at amazon dot com or at identity schemes dot com. but trust me, it is a lot better than paris is burning, because its a 2005 make.
