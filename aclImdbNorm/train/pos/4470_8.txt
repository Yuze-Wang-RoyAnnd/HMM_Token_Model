similar to "on the town," this musical about sailors on shore leave falls short of the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs, but it has its own charms. kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with jerry the cartoon mouse of "tom and jerry" fame, one with a little girl, and a fantasy sequence where he is a spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony. sinatra, playing kelly's shy, inexperienced buddy, and grayson, the woman who serves as the love interest for both men, do most of the singing. iturbi provides some fine piano playing. at nearly two and half hours, it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag.
