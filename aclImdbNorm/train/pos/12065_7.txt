"insignificance" is a far from great film, from a stage play, directed by nic roeg. in the scheme of roeg's films, this is above the level of most of his post-"don't look now" work, which is characterised by judicious use of theresa russell as lead actress. she's actually very good here, and far from the problem in other roeg films like "bad timing" and "cold heaven". as the "actress", who is marilyn monroe, russell is very effective, portraying her as a thoroughly depressive, but likeable siren. she plays well alongside michael emil as einstein, who is excellent to say the least. he looks the part admirably, and while theresa russell doesn't look exactly like monroe, she certainly is attractive enough to make the part ring true. other players are adequate if not quite as arresting as emil and russell are. a pretty workable, intelligent script is directed well by roeg, but certainly not brilliantly, like "walkabout" or "performance". as in other later roeg films, he tends to rely too much on vague, insubstantial flashbacks, that add very little to the film. in many ways the film would have worked better as a shorter (say, 60 minutes), more modest piece. still, a quite acceptable, passable film. at times quite excellent, but somewhat lacking overall. rating:- *** 1/2/*****
