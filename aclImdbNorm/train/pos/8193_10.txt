main theme in this dirty harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold. sandra locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful. locke is an "8" normally, but, with a deadly pistol in her purse, "cocked" for the bad guys, she climbs all the way up the scale to a "10". having been gang-raped, along with her younger sister, some years ago, locke, as jennifer spencer, has tried to block out the attack from her life, as best she can. her sister, tho, is almost comatose as a result of the trauma, so the memory is never far from her mind. one day, jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in s.f.; she buys a pistol, follows him to a bar, lets him pick her up, then when they're alone in his cadillac, beginning to make love, she shoots him....once in the genitals, once in the brain - - this in the opening scene!! ya gotta love this spunky lady. she's got her priorities straight. plus, jennifer is a professional artist, putting all her anger on canvas until now. after executing her first perp, jennifer curiously watches det. insp. harry callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the caddy. then, she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street, visits her sister in a nursing home, then goes a'hunting in san paolo, ca "up the coast" where the rape event took place years ago. with more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind, our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall, as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist. not uncommon to us right- wingers, when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal, don't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity, we remember the crime and the suffering he inflicted. such recalled events steels jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers - once in the genitals, once in the brain. throughout the movie, scenes of jennifer's revenge are interspersed with good, il' dirty harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop, remember "go ahead. make my day."? later on, he threatens to step on a punk kid (who'd just insulted callahan) in a courthouse elevator like he'd step on dog- s**t....leaving a young female govt employee staring after clint as if to say "i want to have your baby." my favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action, when harry threatens and frightens a murderous mafia boss named threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter's wedding reception at the mark hopkins hotel. michael grazzo (pantangeli in godfather ii) does a wonderful job as the sinful mafia don, even if he's only in one scene, dying in a most-convincing manner. however, harry's troubles aren't over with yet! the elevator punk's gang and threlkis' henchmen each attempt to assassinate harry in two close-ordered scenes, and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly. yup, some of the gun-play comes off as uninspired screen violence....looking like clint the director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie. but, there's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets. the punk kids die much more creatively, though, as they both burn to death and drown in s.f. bay. warms my heart. with so much violent intent directed at insp. callahan, his bosses send him to san paolo to try to get some background on the "22 caliber vasectomy killing" as jennifer spencer's crime is now known, but not before harry delivers one of his famous sermons-to-the- chowder-headed-liberals. love that harry. while our hero' up annoying the local cops and citizens in san paolo, two more murders happen, same m.o., on a sleazy, lazy fisherman and on an equally-creepy hardware entrepreneur. then harry meets jennifer! they find they both agree on subjects such as law and order, making the guilty pay, etc. could a hot, love scene be in the offing soon? we're led to believe just that. characters abound in this real-man meets real-woman crime drama, and we get to meet a brassy bull-dyke named raye parkins who's both irritating and entertaining. raye set up jennifer's rape for her "boyfriend" years before, and she'll get hers eventually. the san paolo police chief, played by reliable eastwood co-star pat hingle (the hanging judge in 'hang em high'), is strangely at odds with callahan's detective work related to the 22-cal vasectomies, until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists. much like jennifer's sister, chief janning's son is now a comatose adult, but driven mad by guilt. it can't end here, though. the dyke's rapist boyfriend, mick, now a kinky-sex jerk of a criminal, drives in from vegas becuz raye's dropped a dime on jennifer, summoning him up to san paolo to prevent more executions. mick sleeps at raye's house, but his timing is all wrong, and he's arrested before he can spend more time with raye, mostly due to the fact that she's since been sent to the island of the eternal lesboes by a shot from jennifer's revolver. psycho mick makes bail at long last, with jennifer gunning for him. a desperate chase ensues, as harry tries to keep these two from killing each other. it all turns out well in the end, with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful roberta flack blues song.
