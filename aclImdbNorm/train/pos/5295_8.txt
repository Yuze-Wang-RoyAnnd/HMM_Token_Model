i thought this was an utterly charming film. the story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of john waters: pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. edward furlong does well in the lead, but the best performances are by his grandmother, mink stole (a hilarious cameo) and, of all people, patty hearst. i think the reviewers are way off base on this one. they seem to be taking pecker's worst valuation of his work as gospel, when i think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist.
