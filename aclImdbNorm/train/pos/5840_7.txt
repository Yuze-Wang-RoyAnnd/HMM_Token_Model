while the premise of the film is pretty lame (ollie is diagnosed with "hornophobia"), the film is an amiable and enjoyable little flick. it's also a darn bit better than the films they went on to make after this one--probably since this was the last hal roach-produced laurel and hardy film. in fact, it wouldn't be a bad idea not to see any of their latter films, as the entire chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their parts purely for pathos--something true laurel and hardy films never would do. they had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack.<br /><br />stan and ollie work at a horn factory. this sounds pretty funny, but it isn't. not surprisingly with all the racket, ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time off work. the doctor (james finlayson--in his last film with the team) recommends an ocean voyage. however, they don't like sailing and stan has an idea of just renting a boat tied to the dock--then they can get all the sea air they want without all the bother! once they are on the boat, a dangerous escaped criminal boards the boat and they all accidentally set out to sea. fortunately, this portion of the film actually was well-paced and the very end worked out very well.<br /><br />while not a great full-length laurel and hardy film, it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers (like in the devil's brother or babes in toyland). additionally, there is still a decent amount of physical comedy--something you would see almost none of after this film. part of this was due to the boys' declining health (and ollie's increasing girth) and part of it was due to the overall insipidness of these later films.
