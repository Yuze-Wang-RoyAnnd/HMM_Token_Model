i must have seen this a dozen times over the years. i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b & w on the local pbs station.<br /><br />i bought a dvd set for the children to see, and am making them watch it. they don't teach history in school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. it expands their critical thinking.<br /><br />impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war.<br /><br />buy it for your children, along with alistair cooke's america. watch it with them, and make them understand. you'll be so glad you did.
