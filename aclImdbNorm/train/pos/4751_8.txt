i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users (some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever.' what?? haven't any of you seen cradle 2 the grave?) my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on. duh! what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie? did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story, then just loaded it up with action? of course not! black mask is awesome, wall-to-wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time. it's also deliciously gruesome, and we get plenty of severed limbs, decapitations, and creative ways of watching the bad guys (and quite a few innocent people, too!) get slaughtered. most of li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to black mask; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence, bloodshed, or action sequences whatsoever! and that made me a happy camper. again: if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot, you are going for the wrong reasons. black mask is probably my favorite of his movies (though, beware of the horrendous dubbing).
