what i expected: a rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team.<br /><br />what i got: an even-handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting -- to themselves and each other -- that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share.<br /><br />sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works! barrymore is classic barrymore: that perfect blend of sweet, strong, and adorable. we expect that from her and she delivered.<br /><br />but fallon is the nice surprise in this film. he brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life, like caring about kids and his girlfriend. fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. he can be caring ("you just ran across the field for me!") and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the red sox ("how did the grass feel? kinda spongy?") at the same time. fallon's portrayal "made" the movie. hopefully, this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for fallon, something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of snl alums (i.e. will ferrell).<br /><br />in short, a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs. female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot-on humorous lines, most delivered with brilliant subtlety by fallon.<br /><br />hey, i saw this with my wife -- not a baseball fan -- and she loved it as much as i did. it's neither a "guy flick" nor a "chick flick". it's a terrific make-you-laugh flick. go see it!
