as with most of eleanor powell's films, this one plays out along the flimsiest of plots. for some reason -- oh it is explained! -- she's selected to transport a magnetic mine to cuba. good guys and bad guys compete for the mine and who is who gets confusing. but, as always, powell's dancing is superb and worth the price of admission. and in this one lahr plays his cowardly lion, evoking warm memories of that technicolor film of 1939. a fringe benefit is hearing a young frank, with that wonderful voice and skinny vulnerability that he abandoned for his wise-guy persona later on. in addition, the great drummer, buddy rich, has a wonderful time displaying his virtuosity. watch particularly for his unique duet with dorsey's trumpet man, ziggy elman. i say "unique" perhaps in ignorance, but i know of no other drum/trumpet sequence like this one on film or records. this film is fun. even skelton's goofy persona is relatively restrained. powell shows again that she is the greatest film dancer ever.
