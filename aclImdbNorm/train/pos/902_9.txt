i thought this movie was really really great because, in india cinemas nowadays, all you see is skin, music, and bad acting...in this movie, you can see some tradition, ethnicity, and at least some decency...although some parts were a little dramatic, guess what? that is what indian cinema is all about! after watching this movie, at least you don't get a headache from all the loud overrated music, or any violence, its just the truth, it teaches about love, and of course caring for the person you love throughout life...i think it was an amazing movie...kids can watch it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india's sure profoundness...until all these rap hits, miniskirts, and skin showing became a part of it.
