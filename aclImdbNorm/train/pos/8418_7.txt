russian emigrant director in hollywood in 1928 (william powell) is casting his epic about the russian revolution, and hires an old ex-general from the czarist regime (emil jannings) to play the general of the film, and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared (evelyn brent), of 11 years before.<br /><br />try as i might, i feel it hard to warm to 'the last command' for all its virtues. 'the docks of new york' was indubitably a great film, and 'underworld' is a film i have always been craving to see, but 'the last command' is rather heavy-going. the premise is fascinating, but the treatment does really make the script come to life, except in the sequences set in hollywood, depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with state-of-the-art technology.<br /><br />emil jannings is, predictably, a marvelous russian general, distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex-general, transfixed in his misery, and the vigorous, hearty officer of yore.<br /><br />the ending is great and worth the wait, but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times.
