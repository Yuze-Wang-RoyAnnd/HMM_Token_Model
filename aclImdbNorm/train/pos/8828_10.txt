i was so glad i came across this short film. i'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across, so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards, i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting for.<br /><br />the plot is pretty simple, the director, writer, and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals. the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy.<br /><br />it's a well made short film, well edited and the actors all do a great job. and the last shot of the film is perfect.<br /><br />i highly recommend this film.
