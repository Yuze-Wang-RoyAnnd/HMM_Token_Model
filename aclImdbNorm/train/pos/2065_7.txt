fearful symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults. the first thing about the episode is that it takes place near mountain home air force base in southwest idaho. season one's 'deep throat' takes place near ellens air base, also in southwest idaho. i'm wondering if the air force bases are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in fearful symmetry. mulder and scully have some good dialog, always a plus. ed meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of cranky, old school teachers. they must have liked children at one time, you just can't imagine how. just like he must have cared more for animals at one point. i liked the concept of the episode, but i felt it had some inconsistencies. if aliens are so adept at abducting humans and returning them safely, why can't they put the animal back in the right place? and the aliens are just now having problems returning the animals? i don't buy mulder's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum. as if he's an expert on that. i also thought jayne atkinson's performance as willa ambrose was not well done. besides those nitpicks, i still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens harvesting animal dna as well as human dna.
