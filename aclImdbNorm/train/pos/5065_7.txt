all in all a good film and better for the fact that had the film not been made the story might remain hidden to the masses. brosnan does a good job as the native american with a hidden past and the photography is stunning. to some, this may be too whimsical, to others boring - for me it is a gentle, well-told tale and perfect for family viewing. now that's not something you get a lot of recently.
