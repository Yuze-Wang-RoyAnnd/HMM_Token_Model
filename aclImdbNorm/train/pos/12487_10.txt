dark remains is a home run plain and simple. the film is full of creepy visuals, and scares' that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat. the staircase scene in particular, these guys are good. although they weren't working on a huge budget everything looks good, and the actors come through. dark remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some, but i guess it makes you think. cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives', however some side characters like the sheriff didn't convince me. they aren't all that important anyways. i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story/ japanese remake.
