i watched the first series avidly, but wondered whether i'd go back again after a lengthy break from it. however, i tuned into episode one of series 2 and was hooked all over again. this really is excellent telly; ground-breaking stuff like mission:impossible back in the 1960s. the characters are well rounded, and expand as the series goes on, they change as they adapt - some more readily than others - to their new surroundings, but they cleverly remain strictly in character, and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone whom you wouldn't have thought you could ever feel sorry for, when something really crushing happens to them. i hope there will be many years of 'lost' to look forward to - and i don't actually mind all that much if i never get answers to all the mysteries!
