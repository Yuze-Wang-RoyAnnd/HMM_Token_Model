just saw this movie today at the seattle international film festival, and enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />great writing and direction, excellent and believable interaction among the cast, and great comic timing as well.<br /><br />this movie touches on themes that are universal-family and separation. as a result, i can see european, asian, and american audiences all finding points of similarity between this film and their own lives.<br /><br />if all that wasn't enough, this has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year...somebody distribute this in the usa, please!<br /><br />finally: thank you maria flom! it really is a great film.
