i just watched the documentary "fog city mavericks" on the starz cable tv network. it is without a doubt, one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever! it chronicles the san francisco bay area artists and creative talent responsible for the some of the best films ever made. in addition to the well-known artists listed, t also includes segments with irvin kershner, caleb deschanel and a segment about pixar animation studios. i hope it will be released on dvd-this is a must for any collection about cinema history and brilliant film-making. if you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
