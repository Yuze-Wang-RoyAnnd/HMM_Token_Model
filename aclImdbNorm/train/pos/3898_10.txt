hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour-de-star-wars-force (luke: how strong? vader: the strength of a small pony), in which, being the master he is, he doesn't even break a sweat, ingeniously sparing himself mascara leakage.. -and that's with almost 2 hours of whirling his way thru history, its birthplace, europe, and more.<br /><br />from heimlich's middle-of-the-night, "i've invented a maneuver!" to the british empire's "..do you have a flag..?" and ancient deadbeat gods, "jeff! the god of biscuits!" and many more, this is fish-flop-on-the-floor-to-jumpstart-your-lungs funny.<br /><br />and i confess to having passed on this video dozens of times over the years, seeing as a british transvestite standup, vogueing on a chair, is one longshot of a rental after all, especially one going back 10 years now. and yet, the material is not only timeless but almost oracular, turning present day into nothing more than an amplified, funnier/sadder version of where we were at a decade ago, although come to think about it, that may just be a coincidence.
