i really enjoyed the 60's. not being of that generation (i'm waiting for "the 80's") it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that era.<br /><br />one major problem in the movie, however, was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families. according to promos i saw for the movie on nbc, the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in 1960's america. now, i may have missed something, but i think we learned more about the white family than the african american family.<br /><br />i really think that the 60's uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors (all of which are very talented.) this is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours in) of the mini-series.<br /><br />very good movie!
