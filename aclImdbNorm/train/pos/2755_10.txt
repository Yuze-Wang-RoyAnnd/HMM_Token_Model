when i first saw this movie, i thought it was the typical "love thy neighbour" stuff....the more the movie was going on, the more i got involved. acting is magnificent from both actors, direction was great, the story unusual. cried my eyes off, first time in my life for a movie. a real must have in any serious videoteque. 11 out of 10
