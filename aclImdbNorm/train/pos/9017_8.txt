this film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an als (lou gehrig's disease)sufferer. the subject is done with compassion as well as humor. helena bonham carter is so convincing as a person with als that i found it hard to believe that she was only acting. kenneth branagh, a superb actor, lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to helena's character as part of his "community service", an alternative to prison time. watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end. tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances. one comes to care deeply for the two of them.
