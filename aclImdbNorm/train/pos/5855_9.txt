if you played "spider-man" on the ps version, then you've seen it all. to truly experience it you should get the dc version. simply put it's a much graphically superior game; the textures are sharp, levels are easy to navigate, and it has much better sound then it's ps cousin. i bought this game back in late '00s and it still holds up even till this day. well, marvel: ultimate alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you're a fan of 'ol web head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library. swinging around the city as spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game. if you have a dreamcast, snag this up for cheap. the dc version is simply incredible.
