no awards show can please all the people. clearly if your favorite movies didn't win, you will say the show wasn't very good. that's understandable.<br /><br />however, the 74th annual academy awards will be remembered for one magical moment of hollywood history:<br /><br />woody allen's first appearance ever at the academy awards.<br /><br />allen has often shunned the awards as being self-aggrandizing and pointless, and has never attended -- even though he has won several of the coveted awards.<br /><br />when the 74th academy awards were held, the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the world trade centers in new york. when it came time to pay tribute to the city of new york, they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities. then the announcer simply said:<br /><br />"ladies and gentleman, oscar award winning director woody allen."<br /><br />the place erupted in an extremely long standing ovation. the entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the man from new york who usually avoids the hollywood scene. as the applause died down, woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation.<br /><br />some highlights:<br /><br />"thank you very much - that makes up for the strip search."<br /><br />"i thought they wanted their oscars back," he joked. "i panicked because the pawn shop has been out of business for ages and i had no way of retrieving anything. "<br /><br />"but that wasn't it. i couldn't work it out because my movie wasn't nominated for anything this year. then it hit me - maybe they were calling to apologise."<br /><br />allen also disclosed why he had overlooked his lifelong oscar-aversion for this one special night.<br /><br />"for new york city, i'd do anything. so i got my tux on and came down here," said allen.<br /><br />"it's a great, great movie town. it's been a great, moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great, great city."<br /><br />
