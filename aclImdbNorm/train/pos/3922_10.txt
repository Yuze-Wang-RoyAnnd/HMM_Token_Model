carmen is one of the best films i've ever seen. it's hard to say whose performance is best: antonio gades, cristina hoyos and laura del sol are superb.they dance their souls out. it's a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth; myth penetrates everyday life. dance becomes life and entire life is danced out. real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else, act out the parts of lovers of old. the magic is continuing.
