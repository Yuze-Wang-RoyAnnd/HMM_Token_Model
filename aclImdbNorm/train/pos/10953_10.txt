i think this show is screamingly funny! it's not for every taste, and i'm not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that don't get it. i'm sure they're wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength. but if you like it, you really like it. sarah plays a self-infatuated loser named "sarah silverman" who often finds her self in homerian predicaments (that's "homerian" as in "homerian simpsonian").<br /><br />i remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early 90's. i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything she's done.<br /><br />this show is choke-on-your-food-and-wet-your-pants funny. therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers. check it out!
