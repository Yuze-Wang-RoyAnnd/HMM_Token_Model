i've just seen it....for those who don't know what it is, i suggest to download the entire feature and enjoy viewing it...it's kinda amateur made trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short batman dead end, but this time besides the black knight there is also superman... it would be wonderful if they made the entire movie...but i'm afraid that it's almost impossible, especially just before the official batman 5 film.<br /><br />-- there is no greater crime against peace than the refusal to fight for it.<br /><br />lorenzo 'purifier'pinto
