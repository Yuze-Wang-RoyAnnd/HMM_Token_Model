the best way for me to describe europa, which is high on the list of my favourite films, is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended: "i didn't know films could be made like that". entirely original in it's visual style, it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. it's as far away from the "master and coverage" style of shooting as one can get; perfectly integrating many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice over, performance, editing, lighting, etc... all equal, none predominant. despite hollywood's "dialogue" myopia, cinema is not about dialogue, nor is it about beautiful lighting, action or music. it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing, where only the blending of those elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element, and the film has no meaning. "europa" is what cinema should strive to be.
