i am so upset that abc is giving up on yet another show that has the chance to be a real winner. this show is so good, the writing and storyline were great, an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. the casting was spectacular! not only were the characters and actors right on, but these are a very talented set of actors. the concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a tv show, many of us share this whole idea of "connections". i really love the characters of steven, laura, whitney and damien. but to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that i did not like, even those that only were in for a few episodes (sheri appleby for example). the acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. i wish abc had given this show more of a chance, and not interrupted the show midway, also it was not advertised enough. truly unfair!! to everyone!!. this show showed great promise. i for one will let abc know how i feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive. please join me, i know we can do it. it worked for jerico. (by the way where is episode 13? i want that last show!). please support this show and send emails to abc,we can do it!!! this show is well worth it!!! petition online to save six degrees: http://www.petitiononline.com/gh1215/petition.html we can do it!! sign this petition asap!!!
