one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain. mark gatiss,reece shearsmith and steve pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy. ably supported by their writing partner jeremy dyson, they have peopled the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. little britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas. consistently original and groundbreaking i am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but i am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on log. i have yet to see the feature length movie but i have heard good things and bad things so i will reserve judgement.the original radio series from which log came was as innovative as the tv series became. i don't know whether the tv series made it to the us but i would be fascinated to see how american audiences found the weird englishness of the humour
