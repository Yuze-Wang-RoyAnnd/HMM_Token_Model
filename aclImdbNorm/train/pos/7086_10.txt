nb: spoilers within. this great movie is "about" so many things, all of them successfully: sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the what-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, worldwide bioterrorism, and a nascent love story.<br /><br />the ramifications of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate - witness the discussions within this site; or, as an extreme, check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. whew! such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot, coming from the magnificent work of writers david and janet peoples, not to mention the inspiration of chris marker's "la jetee." without a doubt, this is one of the most successful, fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived. but there are many other levels speaking here.<br /><br />the movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of james cole (bruce willis, doing the best work of his career here). his journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim
