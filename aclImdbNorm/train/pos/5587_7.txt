first, let's get the "hoopla" out of the way.hedy lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen.here we have hedy as a young fresh-faced 20 year old speaking in her native austrian.i recently bought a 1990 uncensored version of this 1932/3 classic.yes we see a brief close up of hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming & runaway horse scenes naked, the director gustav machaty uses the cover of branches, reflections in puddles, medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene; so don't go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches.her boyfriend , pierre nay keeps his clothes on at all times.yes, fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through 2003 eyes.<br /><br />as other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary, expressionism, and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water, farm machinery, landscapes etc.sweet sounding strings run for most of "extase's" length and the film has a "feel" of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept.the script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of german spoken by the actors with english subtitles beneath.even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film.<br /><br />put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man (why we are never told and what did eva see in him anyway?money?), who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage.she then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law.after a ride on her horse eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horse's saddle.however her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate.hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner.and so the romance is born.her husband seeing that his rival must win eva, later decides to shoot himself but i thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with eva.<br /><br />despite being a 1990 reissue title on vhs, the sound being 70 years old, is a bit soft and with background crackles, in line with films of its age.after a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after.just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late 1930's vintage.this is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title.i gave it 7/10.
