for anyone who may not know what a one-actor movie was like, this is the best example. this plot is ridiculous, and really makes no sense. it's full of cliched situations, hackneyed lines, melodrama, comedy... you name it!<br /><br />but amitabh bachchan can make anything convincing, and this movie is by no means an exception. everyone turns in a decent performance - shashi kapoor, waheeda rehman, ranjit, om prakash, smita patil... but it is the megastar who overshadows everyone with his towering presence. without him, this movie would have been a non-starter... the story is about separation / mistaken identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good vs evil - everything, really! amitabh's is a brilliant performance on all counts, in an otherwise silly film! and did i mention that it is ridiculously funny?
