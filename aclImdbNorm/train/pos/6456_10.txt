my expectations were quite high for this film. everyone i know who saw this film at the cinema told me that everyone there stayed through the credits because they were so touched. my expectations could not have been any higher, anything short of wonderful would have disappointed me.<br /><br />i was anything but disappointed by this movie. i loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a hollywood film tends to include. in this film characters worked through problems they had had for decades, they worked through prejudicm, they learned to open up. but it did not come easily, and not just by singing a song or two. it was painful, it took arguments, it took confrontations. it felt like real life.<br /><br />one scene that really stuck out to me was the scene in which gabriella sings her song. helen sj"oholm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is lovely, and you could tell that she was not just lip-syncing to a previous recording during filming (which i often find in other movies), she really sang with her whole body and soul. you could feel what gabriella was feeling in that scene. had this movie been made in hollywood her song would most likely have been sung toward the end, and it would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways, as well as making the other people in the village realise a thing or two. instead it came halfway through, and it did not bring any solutions. her husband did not become overwhelmed and realise what he's putting her through, and it didn't seem to make anyone else in the village more open minded. it was beautiful, it was pure and it was touching but it did not magically solve all her problems. that felt real to me, that's probably what would have happened in real life. the whole movie felt like real life to me, nothing neatly wrapped up but everything with a sense of joy and happiness. you rarely find a movie which feels so realistic.<br /><br />there were a few things that bothered me, but hey, no movie is perfect. if you haven't already you should go see "as it is in heaven" and be filled with a joy for life, a sense of hope and the feeling that you've been touched on a level movies rarely reach. you will be sad, pained, happy and a dozen other emotions.<br /><br />someone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir there would be no more wars. having seen this film i might have to agree.
