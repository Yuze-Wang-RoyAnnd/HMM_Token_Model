...that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version.<br /><br />despite all of the other comments written here, i really prefer the bette davis version, even though the novak version has a more coherent story line.<br /><br />however: davis' mildred's raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute.<br /><br />and it is those raw emotions that constitute *part* of what the poor doctor falls in love with. he has emotions of despair, of failure, of "otherness" - strong emotions that he represses. davis' mildred, on the other hand, displays her emotions immediately and without censure. she has no feelings of despair, or of failure, or of "otherness"; rather, she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era.<br /><br />novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis', almost through the the whole movie. davis' mildred was **never** vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance. and when he reviles her - for her method of keeping body and soul together, and for continually taking advantage of his love for her - she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen: "i wiped my mouth! i wiped my mouth!!" novak's vulnerability was excellent. davis' realism was monumental.<br /><br />imdb votes concur!
