of course the average "sci-fi" battle star gallactica fan will hate this. that kind of makes me happy. i don't like those cheesy sci-fi shows especially battle-star gallactica and that is why i like this show.<br /><br />the creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this (the unconventional sci-fi way) and it was worth it. i read on wiki that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just sci-fi nerds.<br /><br />this is probably the most promising show since lost. it has the most interesting, clever, and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly unique.<br /><br />what i love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great anime! from young teens running around shooting guns, to and extremely well balanced and complex script, to robots it reminds me of something that came from japan except a little bit better (most anime is too confusing).
