i really enjoyed this movie. i am a single dad with a 17 year old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. i wish my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others! so for me, perhaps this is pg level fantasyland. i read many nancy drew books in my teen years, long, long ago. sure this character was ably played by emma roberts but did not resemble the nancy drew i recall from the books. that is due to script, not the acting.<br /><br />emma is an adorable teen, playing a self-confident, industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste. she is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her. there are some weaknesses in the plot, aside from not resembling the nancy drew of the books, and trying to figure out what decade we're in. (like, what is that car, anyway?) <br /><br />i read the imdb overview before seeing the film, as i was researching rachael leigh cook from other movies. this is not one of her best roles, but i will continue looking for more of her films. rachael was too old to play this lead, but does a fine job as the grown-up orphan central to the mystery.<br /><br />i am very disappointed in other reviews written here. some expect perfect connection with the books, some expect more credible situations or adult action film. i got what i expected! good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls, and their fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement. this is a teen pg movie, not james bond! which would you want for a role model for your teenaged daughter?
