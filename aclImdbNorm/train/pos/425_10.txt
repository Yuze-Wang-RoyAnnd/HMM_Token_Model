i would like to comment on the movie april love. it's one of my all time favorites because my father, nelson malone plays the horse trainer. i remember distinctly when hollywood came to lexington, ky, where we were living at the time to make april love. my dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and lo and behold he came home w/the script. how exciting is that! also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the ones shown at the amusement park. it's very nostalgic every april when i see the movie being shown once again, and the song april love by pat boone is still played on the radio. timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w/all the sex, foul language and violence. it would be refreshing to see more movies like april love come back into focus...
