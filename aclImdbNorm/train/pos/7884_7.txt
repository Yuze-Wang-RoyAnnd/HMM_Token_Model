warning!!! tons of dead giveaways!!! don't read if you haven't seen this series! or you can, whatever.<br /><br />they're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another; liars, cheats, maybe even some words that can't be uttered. but when elm street 6: freddy's dead shows everyone who thought the series got old, and wanted to stop seeing him, or people who wanted their hero (or villian) just stops for his final breath, this film was it.<br /><br />this film starts with a parody of wizard of oz, then you see a kid who is named only as john doe, who is the last child in springwood, ohio, leaves and gets out of freddy territory. a woman who resides at a hospital/ place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy, and at the same time, has a dream about a man, a water tower, and a promise of a secret floating in her mind, goes back to springwood to figure out this frightening vision, and soon finds out that she is freddy's child, and we soon find out that freddy can only leave springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him. and beyond that, fright ensues. this film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know.<br /><br />this film has tons of humor, and cameo appearences, like rosanne barr and tom arnold, alice cooper, johnny depp, and a very young breckin meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and iron butterfly's "in-a-gadda-da-vida", then gets stuck in a super mario parody of sorts. this film will either make you hate this movie, or like krueger even more. the best of the best.
