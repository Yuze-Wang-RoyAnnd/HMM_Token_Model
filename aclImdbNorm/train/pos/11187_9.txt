pet semetary (1989) 9/10 the creed family have just moved into the small town of ludlow. the family consists of a father, louis, a mother, rachel, a brother gage, and a daughter, ellen. they are greeted with kindness by jud crandall. jud is 89, and could basically tell you about the entire history of ludlow.<br /><br />behind the creed's new house, there is a path leading to a pet cemetery (spelled pet sematary). when ellen wants to go up to see it, jud willfully takes the family on a trip. that is the start of hell for the creed family.<br /><br />when rachel and the kids are gone, ellen's cat church dies. jud feels that ellen isn't ready for the death of her cat, so he suggests louis follow him further up the path, past the pet cemetery.<br /><br />jud tells louis of this burial ground, once used by micmac indians. louis buries church, without jud's help. a couple of days later, church returns, alive, but from hell.<br /><br />this movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me, aside from "the exorcist." the greatest performance would ever be zelda, rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or victor pascow, a ghost who tries to help the creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead.<br /><br />the music in this movie plays an extravagant part. it is at the same time sad and mysterious. it goes along with the movie wonderfully.<br /><br />9/10
