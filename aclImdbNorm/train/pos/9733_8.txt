'how to lose friends and alienate people' is an entertaining, if loose, adaptation of toby young's memoir of the same name. it's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in imdb reviews! the basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly hollywoodised. simon pegg, despite playing an essentially irritating person, is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film. strange to think only a few years ago he was just a tv sitcom guy and now he's rubbing shoulders with hollywood names. there's a good supporting cast and it's an amusing, easy watch - kind of a male 'ugly betty', but funnier.
