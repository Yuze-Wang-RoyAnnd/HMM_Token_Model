fire and ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world. the film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier which is the home of the evil ice lord named nekron. the only survivor of the village is a young man named larn who sets out to avenge those who were killed by the glacier. the ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land named teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. larn sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill nekron. fire and ice is directed by ralph bakshi who is one of my favourite adult animators. he has brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of fritz the cat and some films he has written himself, like the great film heavy traffic. i didn't like fire and ice nearly as much as i have ralph bakshi's other work, but i still found the film to be enjoyable. it had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough. the only basic complaints i have is that i wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it. i also wish the film was a bit longer because it is under 80 minutes in running time. still it's an entertaining action adventure films that unlike fritz the cat or heavy traffic is appropriate for kids 8 and older. i only wish that there was a more developed story and it went on a bit longer than it did.
