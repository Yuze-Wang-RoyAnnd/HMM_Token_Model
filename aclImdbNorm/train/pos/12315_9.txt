there are 21 comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism. this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it.<br /><br />it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15-year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action, to the humour and even to the beautiful music score.<br /><br />i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk, i will certainly be adding it to my collection.
