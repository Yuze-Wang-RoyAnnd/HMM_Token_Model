this film is outstanding and wonderfully scored. prince's oscar for music was richly deserved (many people don't know he won one). i think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on dvd. a great surprise: prince does a fine job acting, and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera. morris day, wendy, and lisa are good in their supporting roles. very cool landmark film.
