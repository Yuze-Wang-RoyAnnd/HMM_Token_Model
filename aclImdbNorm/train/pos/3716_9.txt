i was treated to a viewing of cracker bag last night before a preview screening of disney's holes. i don't know who decided to show it but i'm so very glad they did. cracker bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot of australia in the early 80s as seen through a child's eye. the "conversations" between eddie and her brother were hilarious and, as with the rest of the film, so true to life. each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my own childhood (being the same age as the director probably helps a little) and the audio multiplied the feeling. i only hope i get to see cracker bag again some day.
