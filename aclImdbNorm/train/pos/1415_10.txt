i saw the german version of the movie in german television and i was really amazed. i generally like to see documentaries, but i can't remember to have seen one that is better than 'earth'. i knew some of the scenes from youtube videos that i found by random browsing. i also remember to have seen parts of the film on multimedia stores, running on the displayed high definition tvs. after seeing the movie it's obvious to me why the footage is so popular among youtube users and multimedia retail managers: it's just so awesome and spectacular that you can't help but stare on the screen, no matter if you're generally interested in nature documentaries or not.<br /><br />without hesitating a 10 out of 10. for sure, there are more thrilling movies, but in regard of documentaries, 'earth' is definitely one of the best of it's genre.
