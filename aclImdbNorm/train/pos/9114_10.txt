considering the lack of art with in african cinema (or black american cinema). the idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers. but the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short. but it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking. the genre is unique and not the typical expectation. it is almost this departure which first catches the eye, so watching it twice is critical. the film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinema.<br /><br />and it is this true art that with an african voice that is extremely rare. the film doesn't copy to attain its message, it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes (not racial but character based stereotypes), from a writers perspective the film is brilliant. it carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development. it must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly. the usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended. but considering the director, owen alik shahadah's last venture 500 years later, music is to be expected. but from a theme point-of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problem
