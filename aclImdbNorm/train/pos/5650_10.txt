"someones at the door". ohhh, how i miss this show so bad.. but we are lucky to now have "invasion". thank you, shawn cassidy. american gothic, had it all.if i had to pick one thing that i liked best about the show, it has to be its "not predictable plot-lines". favorite actor was lucas black.. i adore that southern accent. i bought the dvd asap, and my kids are fans too. there is some hot n steamy scenes. some devilish ones too. so, if kiddos will be watching you may want to edit(fastforward/skip). it has humour, on a joss wheedon level, which so many shows lack. adult wit and adult situation, that are handled with finese. the dvd has some extras, but i wish it has many more. if you want to get thrilled and enjoy a great show, come watch "american gothic"!
