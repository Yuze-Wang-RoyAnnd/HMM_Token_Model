i question anyone saying they don't care for this movie. some reviewers have said it didn't have enough action, some said it was too long, etc. don't listen to them!!! if you like shawshank redemption and/or braveheart, you will definitely love this movie!<br /><br />the acting performances are superb! tim roth, john hurt and jessica lang are allsuperb and liam neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size. the cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking. it is onw of the few movies i have seen in my life (along with shawshank) that was virtually flawless from casting, directing, writing, acting, etc.!!!<br /><br />i was amazed this wasn't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed. i felt so passionately about it that i just registered with imdb so i could let everyone know the real scoop. i have seen this movie about 10 times (each time with a different person) and everyone has loved it! you must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning. if you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site, than you will love this movie! come on...all 3 lord of the rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at #32?!?! that should show you the age range of most reviewers here!<br /><br />this is a top 50 movie!!!
