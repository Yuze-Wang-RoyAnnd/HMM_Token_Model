another comment about this film made it sound lousy. given talking pictures were so new - i think the script and acting were good. davis was so young and fresh. she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.<br /><br />so many clich'es came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years. my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was. keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments.
