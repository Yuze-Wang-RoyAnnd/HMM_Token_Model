good: engaging cinematic firefights, great presentation, vehicles are actually fun to drive, fairly appealing multiplayer, faithful to the movie, and the list goes on.<br /><br />bad: main missions are a bit short.<br /><br />this game defines what a "good" third person shooter(not necessarily a spy-game) is. great firefights carry on the story and make you want to complete every single mission through, and unlock all the genuine bonuses the game has to offer. the hype this game had, was lived up to, and i personally think you should buy it, and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one. loads of fun. <br /><br />the sound in this game, is a rip-roaring achievement from a few previous bond games, and firing a weapon, really feels like you're firing a weapon. it ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy.<br /><br />all in all, this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through, and some multiplayer that can compete with the standards of the crafty james bond "nightfire" game for gamecube.
