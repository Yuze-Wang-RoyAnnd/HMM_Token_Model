this film is one of the more risqu'e black and white films of this time in the early 1930's before the hoyts code was enforced. it's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to new york and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there.<br /><br />barbara stanwyck plays the young and beautiful lily powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance. lily moves to new york and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men. stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals, hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were pawns. lily powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money.<br /><br />i thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films i have seen because there is hardly any background music heard. i believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film. the few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain. the filming and different scenes were something fantastic! the director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film full of realism.<br /><br />this film was all together an alright movie.the ending to this movie wasn't as good as it should have been, but it didn't entirely ruin it. baby face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie, and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next. but this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once, and suggested to some people and friends.
