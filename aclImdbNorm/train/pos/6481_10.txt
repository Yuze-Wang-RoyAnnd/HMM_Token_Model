i saw this series when i was a kid and loved the detail it went into and never forgot it. i finally purchased the dvd collection and its just how i remembered. this is just how a doco should be, unbiased and factual. the film footage is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic. the only other series that i have found equal to this is 'die deutschen panzer'.<br /><br />i only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series, then they might make some great war movies.<br /><br />note. band of brothers, saving private ryan, letters from iwo jima, flags of our fathers and when trumpets fade are some i'd recommend
