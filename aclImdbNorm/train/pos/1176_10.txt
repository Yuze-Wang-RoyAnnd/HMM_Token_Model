firstly let me say that i didn't like the fact that the rock won the title that is so gay. next i feel regal should have got back his european title, jeff hardy is a crappy champ. rob van dam had the intercontinental title too long already brock should have won it. i am pleased with storm and christian being tag champs, best match was the booker t and big show match in my opinion.
