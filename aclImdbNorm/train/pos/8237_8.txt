for the life of me, why did this film receive an r rating?! while it is about flesh-eating zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good family-friendly film--at least if your kids are age 10 and older. unlike the traditional zombie films, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values--albeit a bit twisted! the language isn't a serious problem, there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids (much like the old tv show "eerie, indiana")--yet some knucklehead slapped an r rating one it! believe me, most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film.<br /><br />the story is set in a parallel-type world. while the fashions, cars and mores appear circa 1953, in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the "zombie war" and massive changes in everyday life. at school, kids are trained in armed combat and there's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack "just in case"! as for life outside of school, it's pretty weird as well, as people now have learned that zombies aren't such a bad thing! heck, using shock collars and training, they can be made into slaves who can do your housework, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be your "special friend".<br /><br />this film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave (played by billy connally). mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie's friend. dad, on the other hand, isn't convinced--as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasn't yet gotten over this!! funny, irreverent and unique--this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience.
