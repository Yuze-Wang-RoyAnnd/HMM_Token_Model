i saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it! bend it like beckham is a fairly typical coming-of-age movie about a fairly atypical girl. this is parminder nagra ("er")'s breakout role, playing jess, a teenager in england who is caught between her traditional indian family and her love of football (that's soccer to us north americans). and even though she's actually much older than her character, she plays the role pitch-perfect.<br /><br />this is a movie about friendship - specifically jess's friendship with jules (keira knightley), her teammate who is also going through family issues, especially with her mom, who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes, and who wants jules to be more feminine, wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. jules and jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. they also, unfortunately, both love the same man - joe, their coach (played by jonathan rhys-meyers). the love triangle causes some strain in their friendship.<br /><br />in some spots, bend it like beckham falls into clich'es. in others, scenes drag on far too long, and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing.<br /><br />but this was a refreshingly fun film about growing up, culture clash, and the love of football. it's about female empowerment, chasing your dreams, and supporting your friends. funny, charming and fun, bend it like beckham is the little film that could... and did.<br /><br />excellent. 8/10.
