a most recommendable masterpiece, not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos, not to mention the acting of giants, mastroianni and moreau, and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis. gregory karr's performance may seem overshadowed by his "tough" partners' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character, which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl (khrysikou) and the man (mastroianni), albeit hinted beforehand. (hence the spoiler.)<br /><br />get your expectations straight! it's an "art movie" in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention. not for spending free time, but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert. due to the overall photographic style, large screen viewing is recommended.<br /><br />dialogues are used sparingly. but the film includes -in addition to the standard greek and english speaking- fragments spoken in albanian, kurdish and turkish, which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages.
