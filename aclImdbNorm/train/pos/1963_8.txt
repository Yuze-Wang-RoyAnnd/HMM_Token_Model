we start all of our reviews with the following information. my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want. the point of this is that critics count for zero. your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me. the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! we never ever listen or read the critics. we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. well enough about that.<br /><br />this movie is very good. not just good but very good. the critics are a bunch of morons. just because there is nudity and language they hated it. it was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for. is that not right? every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want
