magnificent and unforgettable, stunningly atmospheric, and brilliantly acted by all.<br /><br />i really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 (and nine ones!)<br /><br />this, along with grapes of wrath, is john ford's greatest movie. i would say that long voyage home is next in line, though quite a way back.<br /><br />rating: 10. it deserves a 12.
