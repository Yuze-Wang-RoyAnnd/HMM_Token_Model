this is an old fashioned, wonderfully fun children's movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever. unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft, this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus that is cute, light hearted, and charming.<br /><br />the tale is set back in 1940 in the english village of peppering eye, where three cockney children, charlie, carrie, & paul rollins, are being evacuated out of danger from world war ii city air raids. they are mistakingly sent to live with eglantine price, who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch. eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to london on their flying bed. here they encounter emilius browne, the fraudulent headmaster of miss price's witchcraft training correspondence school. miss price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the bookman and his associate, swinburne.<br /><br />angela lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training, miss price. david tomlinson plays mr. browne, headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school, who has now turned street magician. this actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie mary poppins. in fact, this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier mary poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. perhaps this movie doesn't have quite such memorable music as chim-chim-cheree, but it does boast some appealing little tunes. some have been critical, but the movie features excellent special effects. all in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment. it's a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely & bewitching tale, which should appeal to the child in all of us.
