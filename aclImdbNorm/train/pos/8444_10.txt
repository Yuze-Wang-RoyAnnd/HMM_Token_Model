following a roughly 7 year rocky road on nbc, it was decided to do just one last super installment. the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block-buster of a tv hour. it had always had a sizable, hard core of hard corps of followers. <br /><br />it was almost as if the series with the full title of "homicide: life on the street" (1993-99) was a sort of "mr. in-between" of series. it was too big to just cancel, but too small to get a case of 'rabid ratings ravings' over. <br /><br />during the precarious tenure on friday evenings, they had presented some of the best and most daringly artistic of hourly dramas. there, i've said it artistic, artistic!! but please, remember we mean artistic, but not just phony, pretentious, pedantic, politically correct preaching.<br /><br />when at last, it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for "homicide"; this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for tv movie. <br /><br />looking at all the past seasons' happenings and parade of regular characters, the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off.<br /><br />our story
