this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context - it was meant to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies (and the '80s saw plenty of them)! i saw this movie when it first came out, and instantly liked it. being a big fan of kiss, it was great to see gene in the movie. and anything with ozzy as a metal-hating preacher can't be all bad! also, fastway was already a favorite of mine, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack.<br /><br />the original vhs (this was pre-dvd) cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon" looking on. it was a special order, and the price for the vhs copy at the time (circa 1987) was $90! i really wanted the movie, but not at that ridiculous price. the 'ozzy-gene' cover was only created for the $5 re-release. the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie, so they had better put 'em on the cover! same thing with the original "little shop of horrors" - jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes, but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star.<br /><br />i have a "trick or treat" web site, and it's surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person! fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to 'sammi curr'.<br /><br />all-in-all, it was just a good time, rock-n-roll movie. definitely not to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed!
