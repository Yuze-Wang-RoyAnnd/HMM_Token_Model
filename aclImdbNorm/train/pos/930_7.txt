i'm sure that most people already know the story-the miserly ebenezer scrooge gets a visit from three spirits (the ghosts of christmas past, present and yet to come) who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways. dickens' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite.<br /><br />while i grew up watching the 1951 version starring alastair sims, and i believe that he is the definitive scrooge, i have been impressed with this version, which was released when i was in high school. george c. scott plays a convincing and mean ebenezer scrooge, and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing. david warner is a good bob cratchit as well.<br /><br />this version is beautifully filmed, and uses more modern filming styles (for the 1980's) which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white version.<br /><br />this is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that i watch almost every year at some point in the christmas season.
