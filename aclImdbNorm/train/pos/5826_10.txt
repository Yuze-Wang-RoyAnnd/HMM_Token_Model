i remember when i first saw this short, i was really laughing so hard, that like with a lot of other films that i have seen, no sound came out! curly is really great at "singing" opera in this one, i am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer, because he was really good! <br /><br />if you noticed, this was filmed near the end of curly's career as a stooge, you could really tell he had changed, because he had lost weight and was thinner, his voice was deepening, his face was getting lined with wrinkles, though he still could pull it off, he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty. this was because he was suffering many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career. be he still managed to pull it off in his last ones! <br /><br />if you don't mind the fact that curly was really getting very ill at this point, this is actually one of their funniest shorts. i know that i didn't mind the fact that curly was really changing, because i still thought that he was great! <br /><br />10/10
