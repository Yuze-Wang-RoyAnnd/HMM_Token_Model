this was a fantastic episode. i saw a clip from it on youtube, and i vowed that should it ever show on tv, i would glue myself to the set in order to watch. i wound up watching it with a friend of mine, who happens to be gay, and the two of us cried at the end. this was a truly well-written, heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two cops who, i felt, really were (in coop's words) "the lucky ones". it is episodes like this one that really make cold case one of the most captivating and much-loved works of television magic on cbs. i anxiously await more episodes, and a re-run of "forever blue" because i will always watch it again and again.
