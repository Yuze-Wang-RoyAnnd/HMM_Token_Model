this film has, over the past ten years, become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences. the three storyline threads given us by kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures. the domestic chitchat between bel geddes and widmark, the movement between rooms, the small gestures such as the phone book barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table, those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife, all are well crafted and natural. more than anything else, i love their porch, that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time. the second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between widmark and douglas' characters. it may not be totally original and does get a bit blustery but all in all, it comes across as real, respectful and efficient. the third thread,the grungy tale of blackie and his tattered little gang, gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world.palance's blackie is as cold as a block of ice. this self-proclaimed business man, this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to. for me, this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience.
