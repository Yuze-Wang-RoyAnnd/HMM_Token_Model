i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves, then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie. now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering. her eyes are the mirror to his soul --and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are.<br /><br />those who take things literally will find marleen gorris' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating. romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded.
