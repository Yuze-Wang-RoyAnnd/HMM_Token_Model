i've watched this movie a number of times, and found it to be very good. this movie is also known as "castle of terror", "coffin of terror", and "dance macabre". barbara steele, is her usual beautiful/creepy self. george riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere, and there is a good deal of tension throughout. the camera angles are good and the acting, for the most part, isn't bad. this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. i have the dvd uncut version, which is far superior to the edited tv version. grab some popcorn, turn out the lights, settle back and enjoy. john r. tracy
