with the mixed reviews this got i wasn't expecting too much, and was pleasantly surprised. it's a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters, excellent portrayals, writing that's breezy without being glib, and a good pace. it looks good too, in a funky way. apparently people either like this movie or just hate it, and i'm one who liked it.
