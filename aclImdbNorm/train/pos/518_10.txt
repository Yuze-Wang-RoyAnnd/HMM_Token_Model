also known as "stairway to heaven" in the us. during wwii british peter carter's (david niven) plane is shot down in combat but he survives. he meets and falls in love with lovely june (kim hunter). but it seems a mistake was made in heaven--he should have died! a french spirit comes to get him but he refuses. he is soon to plead his case in front of a heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to live.<br /><br />sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film. the script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straight-faced and it's beautifully directed--the scenes on earth are in breath-taking technicolor (i've never seen such beautiful blue skies) and the scenes in heaven are in black and white! niven is a little stiff at times but hunter is just great (and very beautiful) and roger livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help niven. the imagery throughout is amazing (especially the staircase and during the final trial sequence) and the special effects are truly great (considering the age of the film). there's also a very strange sequence when niven runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep! this is an absolutely beautiful, thought provoking film--highly recommended. this remains unknown in the us which is a shame.
