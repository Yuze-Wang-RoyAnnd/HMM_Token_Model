this documentary has been aired on both rte and bbc in the last number of months. having seen it twice now i would recommend it to anyone with an interest in media and documentary film making.<br /><br />initially this documentary was meant to detail the political life of venezuelan president hugo chavez. the irish crew set off with those intentions. what happens when they get to venezuela is startling as they witness first hand the attempted overthrow by rebel factions (particularly the oil concerns in venezuela) of chavez and his government. what we the audience witness is just how the media manipulates the situation and in effect backs the overthrow of chavez by distorting events that transpire as the coup heightens.<br /><br />it really is an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers.<br /><br />
