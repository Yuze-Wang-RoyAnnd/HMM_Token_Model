kudos to fawcett to taking on roles that, at the time were considered controversial. to my recollection, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980's, and women's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time.<br /><br />fawcett is simply a woman who is followed, then stalked by actor james russo. he is adequate as the obsessed psychopath, but at times a bit transparent.<br /><br />diana scarwid has a bit role, as does alfre woodard as the house mate. woodard worries about the legal consequences when fawcett, the rape victim, takes revenge on the culprit. the scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at russo is classic, and as the rapist he deserves it. she then keeps him in bondage, and the consequences must be faced.<br /><br />a very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated, physically, and mentally. highly recommended. 8/10.
