i watched part one two days ago and today i saw part two. of course the two parts are worlds apart so i am a little shaken by all that i just saw. i felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of che's death; for me, it clouded the entire movie. i suppose that is exactly what soderbergh wanted us to feel, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. part two was so downbeat compared to, again an inevitability but in cuba it was positive and in bolivia it was so negative. the politics of the movement in bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically. for me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the bolivian official where that official questions che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. i had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict, argentine versus bolivian. i thought soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves. i was struck by how hard it would be to try something as che tried. i guess it is all in the timing; is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement; in bolivia there wasn't. che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to fidel read at the beginning of the film: if not now, when, 50 years from now. a very thought provoking and well done film; make every effort to see it.
