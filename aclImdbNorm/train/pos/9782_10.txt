peaches is truly a marvelous film. i write this to refute a review from someone called 'auscrit', that has appeared on this site. first of all the idea that either monahans first film 'the interview' is somehow tv is an extraordinary statement. here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best australian films ever made. it fully deserved to win best picture. peaches is a brave, bold and courageous departure. for me it works on every level and i have now seen it twice. monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity. for 'auscrit' to make the comment that it is another tv movie etc and that hugo weaving is no good simply does not 'get' the film. or more particularly does not want to get it. frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both. or someone from inside the industry either distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. your average punter, i have found just does not write comments like that. i have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film sommersault. one has to wonder what people think they are looking at. unfortunately in australia at the time ss was released the push was, if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film. this manipulation of the media is pretty common down under. the reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage films. unfortunately for me ss is a film about nothing, that could have been told in 15 minutes. i see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety. peaches in comparison is a master piece. personally i cannot wait to what monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. in conclusion if the film does not win all at this years afi's and if awards, then it is a rigged game. as for auscrit, please find something more constructive do with your time
