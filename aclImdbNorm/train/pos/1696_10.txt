this is cult stuff. my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie. its very funny and very dry . i've seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy it.the actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing! if you enjoyed "morons from out of space" you will love this. a great play on war of the worlds. i love the red-neck rampage to get the aliens, the bug on the hood, the dod, the heat seeking populous annihilator, the mine field, the red camo, breaking the speed limit by 1800mph! "i'll get the bucket!" very funny. i would love for this to come out on dvd! forget the negative reviews see it for yourself!
