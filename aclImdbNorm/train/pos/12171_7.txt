i was literally preparing to hate this movie, so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing. overall, the story and gags are contrived, but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off. that gag where jason lee thinks he has crabs, and tries not to let his boss/future father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself isn't terribly intelligent, but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter. very few of the film's gags are high-brow, but they made me laugh. as i said, the film has charm and charm can go a long way. <br /><br />the characters are likable, too. i must say i wish i got to see more of james brolin's character, since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in. plus, i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife (who serves as the obstacle in the plot) a total witch. the selma blair character is hardly unlikable, and there's never a scene where i thought to myself, "why did he want to marry her in the first place?" the ending is hollywood-ish, but it could've been much more schmaltzy. <br /><br />the cast is talented. i haven't had a favorable view of most of jason lee's mainstream work. i just loved him so much in kevin smith's films that i couldn't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles. and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles. even in this movie, he doesn't look perfectly comfortable, but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene. but i still miss his work in independent films. julia stiles proves again why she's so damn likable. of course, she's a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint, but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality. in other words, her beauty shows inside and out. i don't know the actresses' name, but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious. julie hagerty also has a small part, and she's always enjoyable to watch, which makes me wish she received better roles. i loved her so much in "airplane" and "lost in america" that it's a shame she doesn't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills. <br /><br />don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records. this is a funny, charming film. romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet, so it's always to see a good one among all these bad apples. <br /><br />my score: 7 (out of 10)
