one thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day. the story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle. the story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on. eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense. all the characters were ok and wil smith did another good day at the office.<br /><br />there are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. the journey it takes you on is interesting enough, if not overwhelming.<br /><br />a good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. i would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights.
