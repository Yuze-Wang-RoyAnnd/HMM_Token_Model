this is a great movie that i don't think gets enough credit as saturday night fever or grease in john travolta's career. he plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. even though it was made in 1980, it is still timely today. the great country music soundtrack is terrific. 10/10
