i teach japanese for an online high school and i include cultural activities so that the students can learn about the country as well as the language. and watching "gung ho" is one of the requirements. the students can either buy or rent the movie. stereotypes or not, this helps the students to see that other people view the world and their lives differently than we do. many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much, they are going to get a copy for themselves. it is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. i just wish i could get a cleaned-up tv version. i'm not really into the crude language the auto workers use all the time.
