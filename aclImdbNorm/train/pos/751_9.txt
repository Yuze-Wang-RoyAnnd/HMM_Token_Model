this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public's misconception of it as a teen flick. it has wonderful performances, particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother, played by a convincing sally kellerman. the three girls that play jodie's friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing.
