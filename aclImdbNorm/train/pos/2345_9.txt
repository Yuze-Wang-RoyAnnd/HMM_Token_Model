i really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more. a little soft on the crime front (it's almost an afterthought and not terribly suspenseful or fleshed out) but thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming. will be watching again for sure! <br /><br />i'm hoping that they'll have a bigger role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses and were somewhat underused this time around. the actress who plays the assistant/waitress (also from bewitched i think) is very sweet and bubbly and comes off as nicely dorky and sweet instead of dumb and annoying which is very nice.<br /><br />check it out.
