'arms and the man' is one of shaw's funniest plays if handled correctly, and this production does a good enough job. helena bonham-carter, pre-film stardom, is raina, the daughter of a military family, who has a peacock of a fianc'e (patrick ryecart), and who shelters a soldier from the enemy (pip torrens) during a raid on the town.<br /><br />full of colour and energy, this production rips along at a good pace, and if bonham-carter and patsy kensit as the maid are outshone a bit by the rest of the cast, they still hold their ground. kika markham and dinsdale landen as the parents are delightful, and the whole play is generally a happy one.<br /><br />highly recommended.
