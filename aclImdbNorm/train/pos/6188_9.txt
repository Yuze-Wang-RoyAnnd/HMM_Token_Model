a murder investigation goes on back stage while the vanities, on its opening night, plays on to an unknowing audience. odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast, its production numbers, and the sheer novelty of the film.<br /><br />gertrude michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars, kitty carlisle and carl brisson, as well as starring in the infamous "sweet marijuana" number (which was also on a 70s bette midler album). so while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage, bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman.<br /><br />we quickly learn that the maid (dorothy stickney) loves brisson from afar, that the wardrobe lady (jessie ralph) is brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (jack oakie) butts into everything. lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. the show's best-known song is "cocktails for two." kitty carlisle also sings the haunting "where do they come from?" and there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a harlem specialty number featuring duke ellington! quite the cast.<br /><br />some terrific acting here, especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney. kitty carlisle is quite good as well. brisson is a total zero though.<br /><br />charles middleton plays homer, toby wing plays nancy, donald meek plays the doctor, and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls.
