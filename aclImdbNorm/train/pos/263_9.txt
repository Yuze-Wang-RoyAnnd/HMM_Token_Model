this was a strong poirot/suchet, television mystery selection. the characters were vivid and well-acted. the plot and the main setting--a student hostel-- were excellent. japp was nothing special but for me did not distract from story. one significant point, many poirot watchers don't recognize good acting or good characterization. i also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the poirot mysteries. finally, i have read few christie novels--none in recent years-- and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel. please, viewers, consider what is presented to you on film, not what you think should be there. that said, the poirot mysteries vary in quality, but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe. with the singular exception of the five little pigs which was fabulous in plot, character and theme, the longer poirot films are neither that good or that bad. for the record, i have seen all the longer poirot/suchet films. finally, films without lemon, hastings, and/or japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence. there presence, however, is either obtrusive (almost always with japp) or irrelevant with hastings. lemon is in the middle.
