as if the film were not of value in itself, this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. in the summer of 1968 i saw the film in nyc; that fall in graduate school, i read the book for the first time. some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film. and for better or worse--and i've now read and taught the novel for over three decades--milo o'shea is still leopold bloom.
