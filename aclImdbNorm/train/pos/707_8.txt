have to be honest and say that i haven't seen many independent films, but i thought this one was very well done. the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction. the angles, settings, and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped. many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it's over (always a sign of a good director).
