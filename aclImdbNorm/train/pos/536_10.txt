few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain as engrossing as this one. technological advances have not dated this classic love story. special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. the acting is superb. david niven, kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job. the use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the movie. it hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. it is my favorite movie of all time. waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is, in itself, "a matter of life and death".
