i'd love to give this movie a 10/10, but in its existing state i can only go to 8/10 tops. the post-code editing (read: destroying) of this film warrants a 2-point demerit.<br /><br />from my very limited knowledge of film history, baby face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the camel's back and brought the full wrath and enforcement of the production code into play in 1934. (i don't know what the other movie was.) as a result, the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re-released after 1934. it was chopped and edited to bits, and no original version is known to exist today. the best that we can see today is the version that tcm (turner classic movies) shows, but that is blatantly edited in several scenes, and has a really disappointing "happy ending" slapped onto the end.<br /><br />all the above being said, the movie is still pretty darned great and lots of fun to watch. barbara stanwyck is, as always, absolutely amazing and wonderful. she is so beautiful and powerful; she just owns the whole movie! she plays a woman who's been used by men her entire life, starting with her father who pimps her out to the local erie, pa steel workers as well as to local politicians in a quid pro quo of 'if you don't shut down my speakeasy i'll let you sleep with my daughter'. when the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick, the smile on stanwyck's face is priceless.<br /><br />after the fire, stanwyck leaves erie with her maid and heads to new york city. she sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top. starting out with the personnel clerk in the hr department, she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank. from there, she sleeps with man after man after man (including a very young john wayne) using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the skyscraper, with increasingly powerful male bosses cum sugar daddies. stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top. it is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apartments as stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder. stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, manipulating, she-vixen in this flick! if you watch this movie, i recommend stopping when you see the george brent character (courtland trenholm) die in stanwyck's arms. skip the remaining 3 minutes or so! the "happy ending" slapped on to the end of the movie for post-code audiences is insulting to the audience's intelligence and lame beyond belief: the bank board members are sitting around a table expositing about mr. and mrs. trenholm's million dollar donation to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in erie, with former vp trenholm now working in the steel mills - cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie - "the end". puh-leeze - how lame! the movie originally ended with george brent succeeding in his suicide attempt. i think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on post-code ending.<br /><br />i certainly hope that a print of the original pre-code version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime (update: the original has been found and should be out on dvd and/or tcm in 2006!). until then, i'll enjoy the tcm version and switch it off before the lame-o post-code ending.
