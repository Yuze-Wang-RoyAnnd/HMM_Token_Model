this is one of my favorite mr. motos, and i have seen them all. as usual lorre is his charming self as the debonair mr. moto. lionel atwill plays a delightfully zany museum curator, the usual comic relief is quite funny here, and there are lots of suspects on whom to cast an eye. it's fast paced and fun.<br /><br />the archaeologist doesn't have quite the same flair as thomas beck, the usual second lead in these programmers, but he's adequate. stepin fetchit is on board, and while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his lines are funny, not demeaning to his intelligence, and he actually saves the day in his brief time on screen.
