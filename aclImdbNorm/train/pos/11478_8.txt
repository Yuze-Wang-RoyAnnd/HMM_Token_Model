chris and andre are two average, ordinary teens. misunderstood by some and picked on by others. but together they stand and all will pay. together they form "the army of two". they scheme and plan "zero day". that day is when they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder 14 people in cold blood. told through the tapes that they made "zero day", it is barely a fictionalized telling of the columbine tragedy.<br /><br />"zero day" is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards. the two main actors (calvin robertson and andre keuck) do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teen walking the street. their performances were very believable, you kinda liked these guys and that was scary. shot on video almost totally from the teen's perspectives "zero day" feels very real and authentic, like you are right there. these kids try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and the actors sell it to you. but be warned it does follow the tragedy from beginning to end and the ending makes be shocking and uneasy for some.
