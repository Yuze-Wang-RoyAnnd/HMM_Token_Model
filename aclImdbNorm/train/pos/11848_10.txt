well, what can i say, this movie really got to me, it's not so bad, as many say, i really loved it, although the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it isn't. first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack (bryan adams), it really goes with the movie. second the simple story, and the drama of spirit gets your attention. one thing i like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now do they ?, but... i don't know, making animals talk is just so... lame.<br /><br />one of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion, i recommend it to everyone, not just the kids :), because it is very relaxing.
