hard to believe, perhaps, but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code. yes indeed, priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin.<br /><br />i'm not making this up. they had several reasons, as follows:<br /><br />item: jane likes sex. she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter. she stretches sensuously, and with a coquettish look she says "tarzan, you've been a bad boy!" so they've not only been having sex, they've been having kinky sex! a few years later, under the hays code, people (especially women) weren't supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex.<br /><br />item: jane prefers a guileless, if wise and resourceful, savage (tarzan) to a civilized, respectable nine-to-five man (holt). when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london, she wavers a bit; when holt tries to kill tarzan, and holt and jane both believe he's dead, she wavers a lot. but when she realizes her man is very much alive, the attractions of civilization vanish for her. and why not? tarzan's and jane's relationship is egalitarian: he lacks the "civilized" insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as "the head of his wife". to boot, he lacks many more "civilized" hangups, for example jealousy. when holt and his buddy arrive, tarzan greets them both cordially, knowing perfectly well that holt is jane's old flame. when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slow-dancing with her to a portable phonograph, tarzan drops out of a tree, and draws his knife. jealous? nope. he's merely cautious toward the weird music machine, since he's never seen one before. once it's explained, he's cool.<br /><br />item: civilized holt is dirty minded. savage tarzan is innocently sexy. as jane slips into holt's lamplit tent, holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress. by contrast, after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off, kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her, there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema: the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet.(the scene was filmed in three versions--clothed, topless and nude--the scene was cut prior to the film's release, but the nude version is restored in the video now available.) and when jane emerges, and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease, jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of "civilized" men and their hangups. where is the "universal prurience" so dear to the hearts of seminarians? nowhere, that's where. another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful. <br /><br />item: the notion that man is the crown of creation, and animals are here only for man's use and comfort, takes a severe beating. holt and his buddy want to be guided to the "elephant graveyard" so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home. they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard. you, reader, are thinking "fat chance!" and you're right. he's shocked. he exclaims "elephants sleep!" which to him explains everything. jane explains tarzan's feelings, which the two "gentlemen" find ridiculous. <br /><br />item: jane, the ex-civilized woman, is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies. holt and buddy blow it, and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. it is jane who maintains her cool. while the boys panic, she takes charge, barks orders at them and passes out the rifles.<br /><br />item: jane's costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath. (the original idea was for her to be topless, with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples, which indeed is the case in one brief scene.)<br /><br />lastly, several men of the cloth complained because the film was called "tarzan and his mate" rather than "tarzan and his wife." no comment!<br /><br />of course, tarzan, who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends, comes to the rescue, routs the white hunters, and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came. the end.<br /><br />so there you have it. an utterly subversive film. like all the other films about complex and interesting women (see, e.g., possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey) which constituted such a flowing genre in the early 30's and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code. <br /><br />the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by jane's soprano version of the famous tarzan yell. a nice touch, which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions.<br /><br />let's hear it for artistic freedom, feminist jane, and sex.
