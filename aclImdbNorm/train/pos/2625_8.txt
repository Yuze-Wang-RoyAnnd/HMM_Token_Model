surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of disney's straight to video throw away sequels. like the previous sequel (the lion king 2) i was glad that disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation. the plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull. to break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences, which much like the jokes, range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge. for the most part the mst3k-like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really don't add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour-long flashback. the new characters are at least likable, and the old characters are out doing their thing so i can't fault them there. overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious lion king titles.
