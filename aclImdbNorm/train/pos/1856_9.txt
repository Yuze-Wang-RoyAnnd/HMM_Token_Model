he glorified himself as a great supporting actor in `glory', he proved he was no `malcolm in the middle' mediocre actor in `malcolm x', he showed his brotherly love for acting in `philadelphia', he pulled a slam dunk in `he got game', he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in `the hurricane', he provided us effective thespian education in `training day', and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct! denzel washington's directorial debut `antwone fisher' is the most moving film of the year. this tearjerker `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the miami dolphins in the 4th quarter against the new england patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. unlike that dolphin tragedy, `antwone fisher' possesses an emotional joyous conclusion. the movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. derek luke's debut performance as antwone is the best admirable acting i have seen by a novice actor in some time now. i actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in luke's acting as i have seen in washington's past performances. it was like if washington was telling luke- ` la la la luke i am your acting father'. ok! i will lay off the star wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. speaking of the great denzel, his work as the psychologist was masterful. but what can you expect from the acting `master d' himself. `antwone fisher' was written by no other than antwone fisher himself. the emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher king' material. i hail to the chief `mr. washington' in catching the right bait in `antwone fisher'. ***** excellent
