i gave this film an 10/10 with some reluctance as it's hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years. the sheer menace on the woman in black's face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread. <br /><br />i saw this when it was first on tv when i was 10 and it really did disturb me for years. i'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too. so many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board, this really is incredibly powerful stuff. i mean i really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not, but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people. i haven't seen it since i was 10 and i'm tempted to watch it again but fear i might have some sleepless nights. i can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly, but i think it's something to do with the fact that fear is the woman's greatest weapon and that we, as viewers, are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely. it's remarkable that other viewers' feelings are so unanimous.<br /><br />i've also seen the stage play, which was an excellent production...but nothing can compare to this.
