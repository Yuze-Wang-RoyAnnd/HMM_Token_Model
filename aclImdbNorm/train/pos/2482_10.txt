the actors play wonderfully, especially kenneth branagh himself. it's good that robin williams got the comedy role of osiric, otherwise it could be a bit strange to see him in such a production. it is really great that kenneth decided to use the fullest version of the text, this happens definitely not too often... thanks to that the viewers can see the whole, not the chosen - by the director - parts. also - thank god that the film is in a classical form; no to surrealistic fanfaberies ! although "tytus andronicus" was impressive nevertheless, but still hamlet is a different story, at least that's my point of view.
