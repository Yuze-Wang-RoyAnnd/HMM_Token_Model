just kidding.<br /><br />seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city, jon voight is young optimist cowboy (almost forest gump-like) joe buck from texas. it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its street-thugs. given his pure heart, he takes pity on one of these thugs, ratso rizzo (dustin hoffman) and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive.<br /><br />while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion. it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie-vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying warhol-party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra-urban new york city. the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between, thereby emphasizing his out-of-place position. we feel for his struggle to fit in, but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo.<br /><br />midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its pure-hearted and out-of-place lead character and, to an extent, the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour - a contrast between country-cowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans. very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommend.<br /><br />8.5/10
