greetings again from the darkness. this one will be compared to "the princess bride" and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.<br /><br />charlie cox plays tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (sienna miller), and agrees to fetch her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes. not much suspense on what happens with these two, but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by michelle pfeiffer and the prince son of king peter o'toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our "star" is wearing. lots of bad chasing the good.<br /><br />along the way, an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see (including any from the carribbean). robert deniro plays captain shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. another encounter involves the brilliant ricky gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.<br /><br />not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director matthew vaughn's ("layer cake") effort deserves an audience. sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. my guess it will find big success on video.
