very rarely does one come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. cross eyed is a rare gem. the writer director not only tackled the challenge of directing his own work, but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate. the script takes an interesting look at not only the plight of the struggling writer, but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of the writer that you can't help but commit to ernie as a character. very funny stuff. despite the tiny budget adam jones manages to give the film a serious look. he's not messing around when it comes to making a good movie. i can't wait to see what he comes up with next. this guy can make people laugh and think; that's special.
