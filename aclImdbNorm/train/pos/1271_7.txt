never having seen this movie, based on the entertaining novel by nicholas katzenbach, and taking into consideration the first rate cast assembled for the production, we decided to take a look. "just cause", while not a horrible film, takes too many liberties with the original material that jeb stuart didn't quite succeed in his treatment. arne glimcher directed.<br /><br />the first thing we think when a young black man is hauled to the local precinct for interrogation is police brutality. after all, sheriff tanny brown, and police officer wilcox, show no mercy in beating bobby earl, who is accused of killing a young white girl. we feel horrified by what the officers do to the prisoner.<br /><br />then, the scene changes. evangeline, bobby earl's grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished harvard professor, a retired lawyer, the young man wants paul armstrong to defend him. she old woman is convincing enough for armstrong to take a look at the case. he is also convinced of the young man's innocence.<br /><br />things are not exactly what we thought they were. when blair sullivan, a man who is serving time in the same facility as bobby earl, comes forward to tell about how he is connected to the young girl's murder, and changes the dynamics of the case. the way it plays in the movie, it serves to confuse the viewer and distract armstrong from arriving at the truth.<br /><br />this thriller is made enjoyable by sean connery, who plays armstrong. laurence fishburne, an intense actor, makes a fine impression as the sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. ed harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. blair underwood, kate capshaw, ruby dee and the young scarlett johansson are seen in supporting roles.<br /><br />the film, even with its faults, will not disappoint.
