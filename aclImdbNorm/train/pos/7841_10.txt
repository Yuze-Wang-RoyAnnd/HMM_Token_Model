this is indeed a treat for every bolan fan, some might think that it's a little over the top, and that it is only about ringo and marc's egos, but i think it's similar to any other concert video, except for the fact that this is marc bolan, not just any guy! i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution, with elton john and ringo starr. this clip alone is worth all the money, i can't believe they did'not release this version as the single. the movie is really superb, especially for us danes. now, i wasn't alive during the 70's. but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them. the media didn't play or show any of the popular music back then, including marc bolan and t.rex, they only played a little with the doors, only the really popular songs though. so, i know from my dad, that seeing this, gives him back a part of his youth, he never got to experience.<br /><br />i wont make this too long, so... if you're the least bit fan of marc bolan, you need to see this. you might find it boring or as said before, a little over the top. but at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever, in action!<br /><br />only thing that disappoints me a little, is that ride a white swan isn't on the tape. but i forgive it, since jeepster and get it on are so wonderfully played.
