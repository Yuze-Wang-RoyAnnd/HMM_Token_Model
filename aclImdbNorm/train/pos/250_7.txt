those who know who know the kelly "legend" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. naomi watt's character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of cinema's best ned (not hard considering the previous ned's include yahoo serious, mick jagger & former carlton champion (australian rules football) bob chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. some location shooting film in the area i live, bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes & ballarat.
