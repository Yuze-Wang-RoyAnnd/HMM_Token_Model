as it is in heaven {spoiler warning)<br /><br />this was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /><br />this is a parable revisiting the life and death of christ. daniel is a superior gifted musician ,who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career , and has to give it up. when he joins a church choir as its cantor, he brings about a transformation in the lives of the choristers , just as jesus did to the society in first century palestine. they laugh, they begin to speak openly and truthfully to each other , their faults are exposed,they accept each other, come to love each other, become a vital community.they include the mentally disabled young man (?tore), such is their inclusiveness.<br /><br />the pastor, stig enjoyed authority through imposing a stifling morality on the congregation, and that is gradually rejected by the choristers . when stig dismisses daniel , there is a revolt, and stig is crushed. stig represents the jewish authorities of jesus' day, whose insistence on obedience to the jewish law,provided a stark contrast to the new life by "the golden rule" brought by jesus.<br /><br />in one dramatic scene, someone declares "the church invented sin". all through the film, there is this contrast between moral-ism and vital living (being).<br /><br />true to the christ story, daniel is killed by conny , when he beats him up, leaves him to drown in the river. next scene , we can hardly believe it when daniel's (resurrected!) body is dragged into his room (the tomb) draped in a white linen sheet (the shroud!), by three women (three women kept vigil at the foot of the cross in the gospel).<br /><br />daniel is drawn closely to lena, a warm beautiful young woman who has been betrayed by a man she loved, and who is now promiscuous (jesus developed a close relationship with mary magdalene- lena- who was probably a high class courtesan/prostitute). through lena, daniel learns to love , something he has longed for, and now finds fulfillment .<br /><br />the solo sung by gabriella , composed by daniel, is all about living a full life , in contrast to moral correctness that leads to concern about sin , and what's right and wrong. <br /><br />the final scene shows the choir all singing/humming in harmony , like a mantra, drawing in the large audience, exemplifying the harmony and inter-connectedness that is our true human destiny.
