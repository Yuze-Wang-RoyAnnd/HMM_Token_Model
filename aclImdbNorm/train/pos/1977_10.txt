i really love this movie. i remember one time when i was in 2nd >grade, my teacher showed it to us on a 16mm film reel. this movie, however, can be a little frightening for 2nd graders such as the scene where bill murders nancy and seeing fagin's face for the first time on the screen. one of my relatives is sick of seeing this movie because she studied over it in music class. if i were a teacher and could grade the people who produced this wonderful film, i would give them an a+.
