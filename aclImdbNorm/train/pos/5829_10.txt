this is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts, and undoubtedly christine mcintyre's best performance with the trio. she is good in a number of other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant. her singing is not funny at all, in fact it is downright beautiful, but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it. we listen to mcintyre sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three times, but it never gets old, partly because we don't tire of her voice, and partly because it blends so well with the stooges' antics. the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty carlisle's role in the marx brothers' "a night at the opera," but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in "opera," and mcintyre (perhaps more in other performances than here) exhibited a comedic talent of her own that carlisle never did. the stooges' buffoonery, mcintyre's singing, and a well-constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
