the scarecrow was on of the funniest killers i have ever seen in the act! plus he's really bouncy most of the time he jumped around, which was awesome! also he had an excellent voice i mean it was just perfect for him. the story lines was excellent too. i like how the kids soul was transferred into scarecrow that was cool! plus he did have a reason for all that killing i mean after what those people did to him.....i would be angry too! scarecrows look was really good! his look gives that person an "omg!" reaction when they see him! which was great the stares he got were funny! those people were stupid, who would stare for that long! they should of glanced and ran for their lives...even though that wouldn't of made a difference!
