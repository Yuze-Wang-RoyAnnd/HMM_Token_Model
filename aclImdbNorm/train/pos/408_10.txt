i can't tell you all how much i love this movie. i have read reviews that say that this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in drying concrete". i say that these reviewers have no imagination! for anyone who loves fantasy fiction, this movie is for you. if you ever loved playing dungeons & dragons... this movie is for you, (especially if you got into the oriental adventures) i'm just sorry that i did not get to see this movie on the big screen. (just more incentive to get my own big screen t.v. :-)
