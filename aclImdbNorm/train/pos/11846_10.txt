i liked this movie a lot. the animation was well done and the romance was cute. i liked most of bryan adams' songs and the hans zimmer score was excellent. what a lot of people don't realize is how well it relates to the heart of darkness/apocalypse now themes (what happens when so-called "civilization" invades someone elses home, what does it mean to be "civilized" etc.). the opening scenery and music were very stirring. the film is a lament to an america that was once beautiful.
