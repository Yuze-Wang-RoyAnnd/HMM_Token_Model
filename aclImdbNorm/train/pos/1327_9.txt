how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad, scary and life-affirming. it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen, even though you were hoping--maybe even beleiving--it wouldn't.<br /><br /> utlimately, this is the film's greatest strength: it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations, then drops a bomb on you.<br /><br /> i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid-'90s. it is not easy to find, but is definitely worth hunting for.
