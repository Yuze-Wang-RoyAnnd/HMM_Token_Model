bugs life is a good film. but to me, it doesn't really compare to movies like toy story and stuff. don't get me wrong, i liked this movie, but it wasn't as good as toy story. the film has the visuals, the laughs, and others that toy story had. but the film didn't feel quite as... i don't know, but i thought it was still a pretty good film. <br /><br />a bugs life... i don't want to say this, is a film that i don't remember. i saw it years ago. of course, i haven't seen toy story in years, but i still remember it. i shouldn't have reviewed this film, but i am. i am giving it a thumbs up, though it's not exactly the best work pixar has done.<br /><br />a bug's life:***/****
