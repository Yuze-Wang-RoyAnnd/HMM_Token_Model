first of all that i would like to say is that edison chen is extremely hot and that sam lee is looking much better than before xd! this is probably one of the most original movies i have seen so far; shows a poverty lifestyle background of a cambodian. the cambodian(edison aka pang) goes around killing people to survive himself; has done it throughout his entire life. sam lee's(wai) duty is to capture the cambodian for good. there are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it. the movie shows the struggles between those two characters; they both beat each other like angry dogs. go and watch ppl...strongly suggessted!!! (go hk films)
