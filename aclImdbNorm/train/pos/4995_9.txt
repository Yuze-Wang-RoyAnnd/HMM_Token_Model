i don't think most of us would tend to apply the term "must-see" to action films, but i was very impressed at how good this film was and it deservedly gets the "must-see" stamp from me.<br /><br />mandy played by shannon lee (daughter of the late and great bruce lee and sister of the late brandon lee) is recruited by martin, a professional thief to help pull off a diamond heist at a museum for a criminal syndicate, and get rewarded handsomely for it. little do they know that another pair of thieves (lucy and tommy, a pair of lovebirds), who were spurned earlier by mandy and martin to get in on the deal, are also planning to steal the diamond.<br /><br />how each pair of thieves plans out the heist is a thrill to watch. things go awry, as martin and mandy unknowingly find themselves a step behind lucy and tommy.<br /><br />you'll find yourself rooting for these thieves as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate, who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in its hands.<br /><br />action fans will not be disappointed, as there's a healthy dose of gun battles, martial arts, and hand-to-hand combat sequences.<br /><br />what is surprising is that, it's not just the action that carries this film, but the romance and laughs (and i don't mean your typical one-liners prevalent in action films) that sneak in.<br /><br />it's not easy to root for bad guys, but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop.<br /><br />a great film and one not to miss!<br /><br />9 out of 10
