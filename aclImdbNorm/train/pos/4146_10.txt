anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film. it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a "spring break movie" plus it makes fun of the college film genre. it's funny, it's got a cast to die for (amy pohler! rachel dratch!, sophie monk!, parker posey! jane lynch! amber tamblyn! missi pyle!) and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. writer/ actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain. wilson phillips! omg! (i'm just repeating myself now...) it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they're dumb.
