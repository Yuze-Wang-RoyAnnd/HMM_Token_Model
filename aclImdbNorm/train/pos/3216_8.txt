stoic and laconic soldier sergeant todd (a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable kurt russell) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant colonel mekum (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by jason isaacs), who has todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants. todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. director paul w.s. anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by david webb peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout. moreover, anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto. russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. bang-up supporting turns by jason scott lee as brutish rival soldier caine 607, connie nielson as the compassionate sandra, sean pertwee as the kindly mace, jared and taylor thorne as mute little boy nathan, gary busey as crusty seasoned veteran captain church, michael chiklis as the jolly johnny pig, and brenda wehle as the sensible mayor hawkins. better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might. david tattersall's polished cinematography, joel mcneely's rousing full-bore orchestral score, and the first-rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing.
