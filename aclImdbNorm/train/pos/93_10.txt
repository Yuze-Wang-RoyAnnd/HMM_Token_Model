my first child was born the year this program came out, and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter. when the cd came out, i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families...it invariably becomes their favorite christmas album. i recently found several dvd's (made on dvd-r from video tapes, probably) for sale on ebay. the one i bought was an excellent copy, and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years. there are some songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever.
