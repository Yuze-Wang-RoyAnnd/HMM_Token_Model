richard brooks excellent 1967 film of truman capote's novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour hoffman's oscar winning performance in the 2005 capote. they really play well together (try them on separate nights). it is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well. these two truly enhance each other. even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock, the two pieces blend well. only the part of the writer (played by paul stewart) in the brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name then capote. i'd suggest watching capote first, followed by in cold blood. it makes for a powerful experience!
