i'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler, but i'm playing it safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br />i adore this movie, and so does everyone i work with -- and that is the point. i spent a large part of my working life in cinema, without being an actor. such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie: the gaffers, the pullers, the on-air directors, the lighters and writers, the costume people etc etc, and the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least to a great extent. most actors are nuts and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, which is what this movie spoofs so well, but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real-life drama! possible spoiler alert: in one great scene, the two leads, both actors, are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal, something entirely 'out-of-script', with another actor, and they start making up lines, rehearsing them, and critiquing each other's performance.<br /><br />since this movie appeared in, what was it, '91, it has become fashionable to do this, especially on tv. but hardly anyone has done it so well.
