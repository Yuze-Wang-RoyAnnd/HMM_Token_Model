born to boogie is a real 'find'--though a rock fan for nearly thirty years, i only first saw the film a few days ago, and rank it among the top rock films of all time; the music's terrific (the cream of t. rex) and the visuals consistently exciting and unusual, leaving this viewer craving any more past directorial efforts of ringo starr, who did a fine job here. if you love the music, you'll be in t. rextasy throughout, as marc bolan really is the star of the piece, front and center. even the fact that some songs are repeated doesn't matter a bit: different venues, costuming, musical arrangements, and bizarre visual concepts are all used to lend different textures and a great deal of upbeat humor to what could have ended up as 'only' a concert film in other hands. as rich and full packed as born to boogie is, the film's only about an hour long, but what is there is totally satisfying. therein lies my only criticism--the video package states something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source claims the film to be 67 minutes, but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of rocking fun.
