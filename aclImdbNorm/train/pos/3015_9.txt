why can't this type of compact, entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century? it keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way. the cast is a great ensemble. william powell exhibits true star quality. who knows--perhaps he was rehearsing for his future as nick charles. he is a joy to watch. one also can see why eugene pallette made more than 200 films. he is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with powell is fun to watch. mary astor does above average work in a not very meaty role. all other hands chip in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes. i suspect michael curtiz had a ball directing his one. bravo!
