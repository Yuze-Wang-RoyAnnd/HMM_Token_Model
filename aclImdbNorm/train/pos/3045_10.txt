this is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. amitabh as a country bumpkin, arjun singh, is hilarious. the best thing is the laughter never stops. the plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. there are villains (ranjit) and there are brothers (sashi kapoor) and there are vixens (parveen babhi) and there are lovers (smita patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure. but this movie is about amitabh and thats all you remember at then end.<br /><br />amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious. later in the movie he turns into the angry young man he is famous for but the humour stays. memorable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.<br /><br />all in all i was rolling with laughter throughout the movie. if you want 3 hours of entertainment with amitabh at his absolute best - this is it. it will easily give it a 10/10.
