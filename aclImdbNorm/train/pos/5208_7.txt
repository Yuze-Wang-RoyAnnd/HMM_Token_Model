if you want your vision of chaplin limited to a lovable tramp and you get your belly laughs from pathos, watch something else. if, however, you love slapstick comedy as performed by one of the best, do watch this one.<br /><br />the image is of the tramp who really cannot get the girl. he spots another couple kissing on a park bench, and he has a blast ruining their fun.<br /><br />this is one of chaplin's "park comedies," filmed in mack sennett's park, with pickpockets and cops and couples. these shorts work, as the format allows chaplin to shine as he weaves through predicaments.<br /><br />i checked the box, as this could be considered a spoiler, though it's not if you've seen these films. everyone ends up in the pond except chaplin. he gets the girl, who in this case was played by minta durfee, a.k.a. mrs. roscoe "fatty" arbuckle.
