this movie is about a side of ireland that americans don't normally see, the narrow-minded religiously prejudiced side of the 'friendliest race in the world'. the movie, by the admission of the inhabitants of fethard who are old enough to remember the events, is fairly accurate (though they insist that the film-makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action).<br /><br />the movie was very unpopular in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the catholic church *did* organise vetoes of minorities (before protestants it was the jews).<br /><br />the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland
