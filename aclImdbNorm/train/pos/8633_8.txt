nicolas mallet is a failure. a teller in a bank, everyone walks all over him. then his friend, a writer who's books no one likes, has a plan to change his life. our hero tells his boss he is quitting. he intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women. and he manages to do just that.<br /><br />if it were not for the amount of death (murder/suicide/natural causes) in the film, this would be a farce. there are numerous jabs at marriage, politics, journalism and...life.<br /><br />jean-louis trintignant is a likable amoral rogue. romy schneider is at her most appealing. definitely worth a look.
