i watched this last night with low expectations. the reasons being, i don't usually like "made for tv" movies and rarely have i liked "cast reunion" movies. but, the critic in the los angeles times seemed to like this, so i gave it a chance. i'm glad i did. it was pretty good. adam west and burt ward reunite as themselves. but, in a way, they were acting as their "batman and robin" selves. they were being campy and not taking themselves, or this movie too seriously. the movie starts out with them searching for the "george barris" designed batmobile, that someone stole before it was to be auctioned off for an orphan's home. while, they are searching for the car, they are also reminiscing about the series that they did together. this is told in flashback. it was well done. the actors that they got, for the younger burt ward and adam west were dead on. and, for a tv movie, it got down to the nitty-gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen. i give this one a 9/10, i liked it that much.
