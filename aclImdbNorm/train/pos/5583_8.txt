i gather at least a few people watched it on sept.2 on tcm. if you did you know that hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the u.s. it was a huge scandal and i gather that the original release in the u.s. was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible. i watched because i had just seen a documentary on "bad women", actresses in the u.s. pre- movie censorship board set up in the early '30s. it looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than hedy's most "sensational" shots in "ecstasy". in fact hedy looked positively innocent in this, by today's standards, and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty. it was a nice, lyrical movie to relax to. i loved it for what it was: a simple romance. i watched it after pre- recording it during a sleepless early a.m. i would love to see the first version released in the u.s. for comparison's sake.
