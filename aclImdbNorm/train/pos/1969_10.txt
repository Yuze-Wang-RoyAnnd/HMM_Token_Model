frankly i don't understand why this movie has been such a big "flop" in publicity. sharon stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and "touch" since "basic instinct". i voted this film 10 and i tell you why: game opens in london this time. london is the city where catherine tramell has moved since the events in bi1. again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class -unchallenged. she is "screwing your brain" as catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain.<br /><br />as for the technical part of the film: only real setback is the b-rate crew of actors. sharon stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and michael douglas etc in the first part. i also think bi2 would have been better had sharon stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma. her b-rate "assistants" are not so bad either although i would have wanted some bigger names to the cast.<br /><br />i think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot. i think this is a far better thriller than many of the run-off-the-mill crap hollywood so readily distributes these days. the plot is great, it's easy to see technically, you don't snore in the half way through the film and most important -the heath is on.
