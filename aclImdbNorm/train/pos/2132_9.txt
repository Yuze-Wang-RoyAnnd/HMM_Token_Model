the cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man-vs.-woman-argue-all-the-time-but-wind up-in love-type of hollywood screwball romance/comedy.<br /><br />i usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm.<br /><br />jimmy stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple. the supporting cast is outstanding - from the always-likable felix bressart to the villain joseph schildkraut. <br /><br />frank morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters i've ever seen him do in his career. he takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him. that "twist" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind.<br /><br />once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. this is a great example of that. in this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. i'll take this over the re-make "you've got mail," any day. no comparison.
