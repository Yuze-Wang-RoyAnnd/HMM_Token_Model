director edward montagne does in a little more than one hour what other, more expensive and hyped films fail to do. mr. montagne shows us a police story written by phillip h. reisman jr. that while, is not one of the best of the genre, it keeps the viewer involved in all that's going on.<br /><br />this is clearly a b type movie. in fact, the best thing going for "the tattooed stranger" is the opportunity to take a peek at the way new york looked in those years. the crystal clear cinematography by william o. steiner, either has been kept that way through the years, or has been lovingly restored.<br /><br />there are great views of new york in the opening sequence. later we are taken to brooklyn to the dumbo section and later on the film travels to the bronx and the gun hill road area with its many monument stores in the area.<br /><br />john miles and walter kinsella made a great detective team. patricia barry is perfect as the plant expert from the museum of natural history. jack lord, who went to bigger things in his career, is seen in a non speaking role.<br /><br />it was great fun to watch a city, as it was, because it doesn't exist any more.
