first, i did like this film. it was well acted by all.<br /><br />however, i don't understand comments i hear from people about a surprise ending. i knew nothing about this movie going in except a few "gotta-see" recommendations, but i knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes. (i won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others.) still, despite it seeming obvious, i kept watching. it was nice to see how everything played out, filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes.<br /><br />i don't hate it when i guess the ending early in a film. i only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery.<br /><br />will smith's screen persona is just likable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. he's energetic and believable in everything that i've seen him do. seven pounds is another fine performance.<br /><br />rosario dawson is a solid performer, portraying a quirky, rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition. beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with rosario, if you don't find her gorgeous, you should think about replacing your eyes.<br /><br />it was nice to see woody harrelson back on the screen. i haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. excellent.<br /><br />a cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. i would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot.<br /><br />overall, i have to recommend this film not for the plotting, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid.
