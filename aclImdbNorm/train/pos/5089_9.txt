true, it does not follow the book very closely, but it's still a very entertaining take on the story. swayze was far better in the role than i expected. and doody avoided the "silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness" portrayal most of us probably expected (cf. kate capshaw in "indiana jones & the temple of doom").<br /><br />at any rate, it's amazingly better than richard chamberlain's awful pair of quatermain flicks.<br /><br />it is very reminiscent of a western in many ways. about the only thing i didn't care for was all the mysticism, but i guess that is part and parcel of the genre. like "how can you have an african adventure story without witch doctresses and preternaturally wise wandering tribesmen?" heh.
