the part of the grinch was made for jim carrey and i was extremely impressed with his performance. not being a great fan of his i was apprehensive but pleasantly surprised with the outcome. taylor momsen as cindy lou who was the cutest little girl i have seen on the screen for a long time and she showed a maturity beyond her years in her acting skills. i was even drawn to tears at one point! i've never read the dr seuss book of the tale so i didnt know what to expect, the humour was quite dark. overall,i enjoyed the film (apart from the songs!) and would recommend it, for family viewing especially.
