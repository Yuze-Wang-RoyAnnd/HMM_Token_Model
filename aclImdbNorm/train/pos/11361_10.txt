though i saw this movie years ago, its impact has never left me. stephen rea's depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving. his anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable. everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts, to the troubled citizen x. each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers, i think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers.
