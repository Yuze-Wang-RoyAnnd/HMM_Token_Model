having lived in ontario my whole life, in the same town that marlene moore grew up in, i've heard stories of her from my parents, grandparents and family members. so when i found out that they would be filming a movie about her, and that the beginning would be shot on my street, and her house quite close to mine i was excited.<br /><br />if you read the book rock a bye baby, which is about marlene moore you get quite the different image of her as a person, she was considered awkwardly beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who frequently abused her as a child, with the exception of one of her brothers. also, if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you'd find out that she was truly wounded before she even set foot in an institution, she was always defensive and what would seem like an unwillingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassment over the fact that she was unable to.<br /><br />marlene did not deserve the life she was given, with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive. it was the government and the people around her that aided further in her death by not attempting to understand her needs and why she did what she did. i still find myself angered that she was put in jail for self-defense from a man who tried to rape her. as her brother once said, "they didn't know what to do with her so they locked her away and it killed her." i believe in that with all my heart.<br /><br />rest in peace marlene, you deserve it so much.
