"life hits us in the face........we must try to stay beautiful"<br /><br />debut movie from one of belgian's best artists (he sings songs), tom barman. a long awaited movie and---happy happy joy joy for flemish filmmaking---really worth watching, and a promising piece of work! it takes us into the lifes of 8 main characters that live through a friday- and night. the title says a lot about the way we spend time with them: we float as they do into friday night's party where they kinda' meet.<br /><br />it's rhytmic style is very 'thought off'. superb use of music. it sometimes takes the upperhand to the images and then you feel its power. gainsbourg! qotsa! the party scene (20minutes???) is a thrilling visual experience cause of the way that it's shot. it keeps you really with it while it's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party.....so hard to shoot.<br /><br />thank you menij`er barman for making this daring movie in these, already some years going, poor times of flemish filmmaking. you made my day!
