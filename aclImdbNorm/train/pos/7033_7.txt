first of all, do not call this a remake of the '63 film. even though this version is truer to the stage play, it is extremely long. the casting was good with some exceptions. chyna phillips was not a good casting choice. she was almost 30 when she did this film, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. jason alexander was good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. tyne daly overdoes her part as mae peterson. george wendt was funny as harry mcaffee, and showed he could even hold a tune. like the '63 film, they casted an unknown to play conrad birdie. marc kudisch had fun with his role as birdie and it showed. i even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing. so what made this a tv ratings flop? it was lengthy for one. they put in new songs and scenes. even though some of the new songs were good (like "let's settle down"), was it really necessary? now don't get me wrong, i liked it, but i rather watch the '63 film (see my review). this was just a case of some actors overdoing roles, making some changes, and once again, length. one more thing i forgot to mention is vanessa williams. she does a good job with the role and the music. give her any lyrics and she could sing them. so here is my advice coming from someone who's done a couple productions of bye bye birdie: if you want to watch an entertaining take on the play, watch the '63 film. if you want to watch a version that is truer to the play, watch the '95 version. just take it in moderation though. don't be a hero and try watch it all in one sitting.
