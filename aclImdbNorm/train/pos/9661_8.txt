after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy, bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler: diva las vegas, a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas. midler, who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's, proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business. from her opening number, her classic "friends", where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud, bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called "i look good" she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections. the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage (even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it, but her ad-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical). bette also treats us to "rose's turn" from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club. she brings the house down near the end with "stay with me, baby" from the rose and her only #1 hit record, "wind beneath my wings" from beaches. it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans, it's a must.
