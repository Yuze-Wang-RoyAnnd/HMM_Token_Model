outside the household is a different world and the family struggle to tread the line between dads authority and their hopes and dreams.<br /><br /> the period is captured; the bakelite light swithes, the georgian floorpan, the picture rails, the wall paper, the short skirts, the cheeky lads, the mini van, shiny modern mangles....<br /><br /> the location is captured; a wind lashed glacier hewn rocky landscape, walls of local stone, community, freedom.<br /><br /> but there is much much more; childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deceit, machismo, manners, maturity, loss, poverty, sacrifice, horror, acceptence, revelation, comedy and parenthood are all there. (and in no particular order!).<br /><br /> this film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevent today as ever. the fact that some of these aren't tackled directly is testament in itself to the attitudes of the day but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the acting skill, the story and the direction.<br /><br /> if there's anything bad about this film, it's that all this deeply entrenched and wonderfully enacted tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end. maybe i missunderstand - the doom and gloom felt by many teenagers really does disappear if they deal with it (**) - maybe the film is trying to send even that message too - well worth doing.<br /><br /> what is the film trying to say? kids: parents were young too, parents struggle too, everyone makes mistakes, everyone learns, things change, struggle can end happily. parents: don't try too hard! try to remember that your support is the key to their well being.<br /><br /> it sounds simplistic doesn't it? sometimes the film feels like that too but it's then that you notice how much is being being challenged and uncovered.<br /><br /> the film is a classic.<br /><br />(**) - not the problems themsleves.
