when i saw the exterminators of year 3000 at first time, i had no expectations for that movie. although, it wasn't so bad as i was thought. it's kind of italian version of roadwarrior, with cast, that is almost famous in italy, including venantino venantini. behind the story is elisa briganti and dardano sacchetti, who are also responsible for story of zombie flesh-eaters. you can also see other links to italian horror movies: luca venantini plays the role of tommy, and you can see that kid in paura nella citta dei morti viventi (city of the living dead aka gates of hell) as john robbins and in cannibal apocalypse as the role of mary's brother. quite entertaining movie, with some dull parts.
