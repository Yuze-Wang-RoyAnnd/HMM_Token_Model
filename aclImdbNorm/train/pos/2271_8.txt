i've just finished listening to the director's commentary for this film, and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film, like mann's the insider, is completely subjective. it's from howard's pov. so, any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it, as ebert did, is really about nolte's character actually. if you feel, as he did, that the film "does not work", then you're saying, i think, that howard does not work. and, to be frank, you might be right. howard's reasoning and personality really wouldn't stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis.<br /><br />but, hey, that's the nature of people.<br /><br />andrew.
