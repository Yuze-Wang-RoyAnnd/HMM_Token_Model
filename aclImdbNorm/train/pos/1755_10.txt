this movie is a riot. i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies. i've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. but this one is wall to wall great lines. i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in. the movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. other than that it's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations. i'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around. you have to see it two or three times to get it all in.<br /><br />as far as the actual film goes, it could have used a better edit, it's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that. all the characters are great. it's not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke. i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. no victims in this movie. also, thank god they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. you just wish that women like her really existed. she's not a "10" like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite.<br /><br />if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it. i assure you, the trailer does not do it justice. they do not give away all the good jokes. just some of the mediocre ones.<br /><br />oh and one more thing. i hope critics put this on their top ten list. many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list. this means you ebert!!!
