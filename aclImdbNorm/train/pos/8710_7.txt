i remember this show from swedish television. i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief.<br /><br />i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed.<br /><br />although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50:s and the political climate of the 70:s. when i think of it, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. the term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them.
