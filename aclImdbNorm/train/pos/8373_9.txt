note to previous reviewer: this movie is "science-fiction adaptation of the iliad" according to the screenwriter. so whether the references are painful or not, no apologies, it is the basis for the film. they admit they stole...though adapted is the p.c. term.<br /><br />great flick but too short. probably didn't come out as well as the author, director, or studio wanted, but pretty damn fun. the fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy.<br /><br />a big-budget remake wouldn't be as fun, and probably wouldn't do the screenplay any more justice. but it's fun to dream about the potential there. a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available but i don't think it would play on ntsc players. i'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out. for now, i live with the vhs incarnation.
