the movie may be great. i just watched it last night, but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because i read the book first. the book is so much better than the movie that i was disappointed with the film. if you plan to watch "of human bondage," don't read the book beforehand. on the other hand, the book is so good, and contains so much more than the love affair phillip has with mildred, you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie. i do not make this claim lightly. i average reading a book every 4 days, and read such disparate authors as danielle steel, ovid, faulkner, plato, and shakespeare. "of human bondage" gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written.
