i for one have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of pushing daisies this season, and hope that the writers' strike won't brutally end the beginnings of a very good show. ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent. emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of knitting. charlotte (chuck) is the once-dead-but-not-anymore childhood friend and sunny spot of ned's life. olive is the jealous but good-hearted waitress. oh, and add the dog. jim dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show. chuck, ned, and emmerson along with olive and occasionally the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the assistance of ned's special gift of bringing dead people back to life. the show is funny, clean, and romantic in a very cute and good-hearted way, and i'd recommend it to anyone.
