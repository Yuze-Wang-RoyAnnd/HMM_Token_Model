contains spoiler with the possible exception of john wayne, no other actor sat taller in the saddle in westerns than james stewart, and this movie proves it. this superb tale of revenge centered around a winchester rifle,has only one weak spot i can think of: the casting of will geer as a very unearp-like wyatt earp. the casting of the villains was good:stephen mcnally, as surly dutch henry,dan duryea as waco johnny dean, and john mcintire(versatile at playing both good guys and bad guys) as a slick gun runner. the showdown between stewart and mcnally on the cliffs is great! i'd stack this western against the whole crop of westerns made today. they wouldn't stand a chance!
