this film is underrated. i loved it. it was truly sweet and heartfelt. a family who struggles but isn't made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today. the film didn't make it an issue that they have little money or are dominican republican the way hollywood have.<br /><br />instead the issue is victor is immature and needs to grow up. he does, slowly, by the film's end. he has a ways to go, but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward. his grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time. a truly heartfelt indie
