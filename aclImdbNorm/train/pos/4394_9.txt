so, neighbor was killing neighbor. reminds me of iraq. as i watched the american flag (50 stars in 1864?) being dragged behind the horse, i realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesn't upset me as much as our destruction/indifference to the bill of rights. i'm a southerner, and must have some historical memory.<br /><br />watching the tobey mcguire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, as he looks at the scalps of blacks and germans (his ethnic background) being wagered at a poker game.....was interesting. many twists in this movie. the wife, who is forced into her marriage, shows both lust and a strong will, characteristics we're not used to seeing in 'respectable victorian southern belles'.<br /><br />the crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin, head of the copeland horse-thieving gang, inc. in mississippi, was hung about that time. bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside, armed. remind you of iraq? and how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background? and why southerners are still fighting that civil war today.<br /><br />too bad we can't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we've just invaded and are occupying, fomenting civil war everywhere. that's mesopotamia, now called iraq, who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil. the wild-eyed killers in missouri, raiding lawrence, kansas could as easily be the insurgents we're fighting now with no success.<br /><br />another anomaly was the father's tribute to the yankees who move into lawrence and erect a school "even before they erect a church. and for that reason, they'll win." huh????? i was taught history in birmingham, al and we were taught that the north was much more industrial and richer.....that's why they won. course, they also literally had god on their side. as you see here, when the freed slave indicates that he's cutting out to free his mother, sold into slavery in texas. god, what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.<br /><br />acting pretty good, lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle (but didn't hear any rebel yells, so reminiscent of football games in alabama). you also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was, as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid. they have lost sight of why they're fighting, and so do we. just more mindless slaughter.<br /><br />you're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from iraq, as the bushwacker (ahh, what connotations) first has his arm seared shut, trying to save it, then has it amputated, and then dies. so much suffering for such a stupid cause.<br /><br />the cinematography is fantastic. now i have to get back to the dvd and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. i suspect that this movie was written by a gore vidal, as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era, if you knew history. the dialogue is definitely thought-provoking. not your ordinary blood and guts war movie, by any means. you see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers, still fighting cause they have nothing else to do. you see the southern raiders, living off the land, stealing indiscriminately. yet, at the beginning, you've seen the battle stop, so the women could be evacuated from danger. as i read the escalating number of women and children dying in iraq, i'm thinking, "where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?" i have forgotten why i sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years, but some book somewhere lauded it. with good reason. tobey at his best, pre-spideyman. buy the dvd or rent it. and tell me why others laud this, not just liberals cest moi.
