i saw the film at the nashville film festival. it was beautifully done, from cinematography to the acting. it's the story of a father and son, and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis. beautifully written with dialog that never rings false, the film showcases the acting talents of paul reiser and peter falk, among others in this outstanding cast. the film begins with the aging father (peter falk)is trying to figure out why his wife (olympia dukakis) has left him. the father presents himself, unannounced, on the doorstep of his son and daughter-in-law. the father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip. they fish, play pool, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get involved in a barroom brawl, and dance with strange women. but more important, they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family. it's the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them.
