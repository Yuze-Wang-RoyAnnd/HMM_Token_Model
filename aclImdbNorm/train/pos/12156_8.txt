some of the background details of this story are based, very, very loosely, on real events of the era in which this was placed. the story combines some of the details of the famous leopold and loeb case along with a bit of aimee semple mcpherson.<br /><br />the story begins with two mothers (shelley winters and debbie reynolds) being hounded as they leave a courtroom. the crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm as their sons were just convicted of a heinous thrill crime. one person in the crowd apparently slashes winters' hand as they make their way to a waiting car.<br /><br />soon after they arrive home, they begin getting threatening phone calls, so reynolds suggests they both move to the west coast together and open a dance school. the dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next shirley temple. one of the parents of these spoiled kids is a multimillionaire who is quite smitten with reynolds and they begin dating. life appears very good. but, when the threatening phone calls begin again, winters responds by flipping out--behaving like she's nearing a psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religion--listening on the radio to 'sister alma' almost constantly. again and again, you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things!! i won't say more, as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting film.<br /><br />in many ways, this film is a lot like the bette davis and joan crawford horror films of the 1960s like "whatever happened to baby jane?", "straight-jacket" and "the nanny". while none of these are exactly intellectual fare, on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun. the writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting. winters is great as a fragile and demented lady and reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 year-olds i've ever seen--plus she can really, really dance.<br /><br />my only concern about all this is that some might find winters' hyper-religiosity in the film a bit tacky--like a cheap attack on christianity. at first i felt that way, but when you meet sister alma, she seems sincere and is not mocked, so i took winters' religious zeal as just a sign of craziness--which, i assume, is all that was intended.<br /><br />by the way, this film is packaged along with "whoever slew auntie roo?"--another shelley winters horror film from 1971. both are great fun...and quite over-the-top!
