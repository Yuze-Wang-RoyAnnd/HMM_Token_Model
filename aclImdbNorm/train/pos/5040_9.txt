i first saw the trailer for frailty on yahoo movies way back in the day, after hearing stephen king praise it to high heaven. not really a fan of either star, i still wanted to see it because i'm a huge thriller fan.<br /><br />i was not disappointed. the acting was superb, especially from the two young boys. usually i loathe child actors, but young adam and young fenton were excellent. bill paxton really did a good job of directing it too. it was beautifully shot.<br /><br />one must also note the plot twists. the three twists at the end hit hard and fast, and i didn't see them coming. the final twist of the film, coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed, gives me chills to this day, even though i've re-watched the film so many times.<br /><br />a true gem.
