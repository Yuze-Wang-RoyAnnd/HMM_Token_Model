sure, the history in this movie was "hollywoodized"--but it's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses. lafitte sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british, not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling, which caused his sailing to galveston; he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero *or* a swashbuckler. but who cares? this is one movie that's sheer entertainment--and face it, we all wanted jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor. brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance.
