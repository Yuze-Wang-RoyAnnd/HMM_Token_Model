the sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clich'ed suspense/mystery but is lifted with some good acting and taut pacing. these stories have already for the most part gone through as many permutations as we can bear, so what we're left with is how good is the acting, how smart are the setups and bad guys, how well crafted is the main plot etc etc.....so the sentinel does a solid job given it's content. michael douglass and kiefer sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitudes. eva longoria (first time i've seen her on screen) brings some satisfactory support. the whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit, but it deserves slack. worth a viewing if you like the genre.
