my discovery of the cinema of jan svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole tradition of czech animation, of which jir'i trnka was a pioneer. his ruka is one of the finest, most technically-impressive animated movies i've ever seen.<br /><br />a potter wakes up and waters his plant. then he goes about making a pot. but in comes the huge hand which crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of itself. he casts the hand out, but soon it returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he's forced to sculpt a stone hand. he sets about it, fainting from exhaustion, but eventually completes the task.<br /><br />in a marvellous sequence of metacinema, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings, which keep him in thrall, and he escapes back home. he shuts himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head.<br /><br />this movie doesn't hide the fact it's pure animation, unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic (why?). the hand, for instance, is clearly someone's hand in a glove. everything else is clay. strings are visible and are part of the narrative, making it a precursor of the movie strings. the atmosphere is eerie: that hand going after the little potter managed to instill more dread in me than many horror movies combined.<br /><br />the movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity. it's a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny which can't help winning the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right.
