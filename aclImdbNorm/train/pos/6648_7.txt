i just came back from the late-night cinema and it was indeed a silent way out as most of the audience pondered though the real-life black & white images of the partition,the freedom movement,etc which was very much reminiscent of the lives' our forefathers faced! amidst this backdrop,mind you,there was no tel/fax/internet in those times but for the very voice of truth & non-violence, the cinematography infused some spirit of stark reality of adversity amidst the strict raj.<br /><br />gandhi shown as a hardworking attorney in south africa,who stood for his basic ideologies and gave every degree of conviction to spread awareness of the same with humility and sainthood which to the uttered speech of general smut was shown as a nice farewell on screen.it had the best drafted speech with a subtle humour & a veiled threat to the british raj in india!there was a nice remark when he said we pray in silence to the british in india now that gandhi,the politician is set for india(towards sainthood).<br /><br />the very backdrop of a big family with many kids needs the mention of an obvious divided attention and love which had to cast it's spell on the unfortunate kid's psyche who was left alone to aspire for unrealistic ambitions.little did harilal knew about his aptitude and he gets emotionally carried away with small pleasures in life and fails in front of the huge idol of his father.he tries to do away from mentor-ship which is the basis of any success which had to be seen by those fortunate neighbours in the streets of gandhi's residence when harilal vents out his frustration in open.this means he becomes mentally weak and gets psychologically deranged to an extent that he is forced into religious conversions and alcoholism ,with debt and dis-obedience fuelling his negative thoughts.he still had shown the sincere love for his mother through touchy scenes and even gandhi's humble expressions form harilal to forgive him didn't meet any conclusions in his mind as he always feared the father,gandhi.<br /><br />he couldn't digest the fact that gandhi couldn't share his love with him as he expected & was driven to rebellion when he couldn't understand the equal-merit based delivery of scholarship money by his father to his cousin where he saw a failed opportunity to study for barrister in england.<br /><br />this had to take it's toll in him thrown to the streets as a beggar when the whole of india was celebrating the indepedence!the life of a destitute never changes come what may but the manner in which the sad death of kasturba & gandhi himself is shown brings in an emotional silence.finally the last turbulent thoughts of the dying harilal is shown as a flashback to keep the audience gripping and wondering where did the father of the nation go wrong? was he clever enough to be mentally strong to lead an-one man army & use his brave soldier-son as a weapon to show to the british & rival forces that when it comes to the interest of the nation,nothing comes in between.sadly though that to read a mahatma's heart one has to live outside his family and see which the emotionally naive harilal couldn't see living inside....<br /><br />a pity that such naive harilal's are still ruining the efforts of many mahatma-like fathers in many families in todays' life and have taken to drugs,alcoholism and god knows what thoughts!!here's a message to all those brave sainik(soldier)-sons please respect the father of the nation!please obey and happiness shall be bestowed or else it's a disaster in waiting,isn't it?
