i really enjoyed this thriller! i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over. the cast was excellent, the plot was suspenseful and entertaining, and it was just an overall enjoyable movie! i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i've ever seen! the girls in it were really cute also, especially denise richards. she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph!
