caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels, and was so intrigued i sought out the next showing.<br /><br />i really didn't know what to expect after reading the program summary, but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed. it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80's, a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these days.<br /><br />the fact that you don't see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot. to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming. and will admit that i shed quite a few tears throughout.<br /><br />on the whole, not a movie that i would seek out to what, however i am sure glad i did see it.
