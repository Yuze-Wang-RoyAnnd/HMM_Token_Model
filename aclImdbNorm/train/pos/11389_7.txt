... oxford, mississippi, at least. okay, the paris we get is paris, culver city apart from the establishing library footage of the real mccoy but it is paris in spirit than which nothing, nowhere, is better. okay, kelly is no astaire but then who is and caron is no hepburn, ditto but alan lerner is light years ahead of the vastly overrated comden and green who scripted kelly's other 'big' 50s musical singin' in the rain (a curious replication of lyricists writing screenplays featuring songs by other lyricists and just to balance things the gershwin numbers are far superior to the arthur freed/nacio herb brown numbers so alan lerner didn't have to feel too outclassed). the story needn't detain us any more than the anomalies -kelly hasn't got change of a match and is a painter, i.e. bohemian, yet he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit at a few hours notice when foch invites him to dinner at her hotel; in the well-documented love is here to stay sequence the lovers are strangely unmolested by passers-by, other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic - this is, after all, a feelgood musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case it stands four square. as feel good musicals go it's definitely in the top 10.
