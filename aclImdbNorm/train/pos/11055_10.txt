well, what can i say, other than these people are super in every way. i quite like sharon mcreedy, i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes, i did not realise that they had made so many, i also think that it is a great shame, that they have not made any more. i wish that i got given these powers, imagine me, being knocked off my cycle, somewhere and being knocked out cold, then waking up in a special hospital. later on, i discover that my body has been enhanced. just like richard barrat. these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, you cannot fight these 3 people, as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry. the music is well written, and to me, puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind, the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats, improved sight, improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon. who i thought was beautiful and intelligent. when i was a boy, i had a huge crush on her!!!! now i can see why, on my dvd set. the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series. i also thought that trymane was a good boss, firm but he got things done!
