when my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together for movie night, there's one movie they insist on watching over and over again: you guessed it, k-911, the third installment in the highly successful k-9 franchise starring everybody's favorite tv dad, jim belushi.<br /><br />folks, i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape, but a dvd?! this has been played so often that it's starting to skip; no joke! but of course you'll have that when you own a film so charming, so brilliant.<br /><br />of course, we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved cop-dog genre with turner and hooch; however, even that film doesn't measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k-9 movies.<br /><br />some nay-sayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series. poppycock, i say. while you might suspect that a third installment - direct-to-video, at that - may not seem like something worth watching, you'd prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie.<br /><br />i won't give away the plot, but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet - one that will have you howling with laughter! it's a shame john belushi isn't alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world.<br /><br />i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party. don't forget the puppy chow!
