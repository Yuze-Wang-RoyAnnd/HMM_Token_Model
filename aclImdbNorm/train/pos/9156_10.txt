i think this movie had to be fun to make it, for us it was fun to watch it. the actors look like they have a fun time. my girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors. not very much do we get to have crazy fun with a movie that is horror make. i see a lot of scary movies and i would watch this one all together once more, or more because we laugh together. if this actors make other scary movies i will watch them. the grander mad man thats chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man. he make us laugh together the most. i would give this movie a high score if you ask me.<br /><br />i don't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors, but the main boy is cute. the actor with the grand chest has to be not real. they doesn't look to real.
