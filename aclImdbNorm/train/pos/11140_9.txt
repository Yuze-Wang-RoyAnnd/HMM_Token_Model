john schlesinger's 'midnight cowboy' is perhaps most notable for being the only x-rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture. this was certainly how i first came to hear of it, and, to be completely honest, i didn't really expect much of the film. this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible, but somehow i didn't consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching. this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners
