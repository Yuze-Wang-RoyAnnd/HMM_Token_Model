i watched this movie by chance, get curious by the trailer on tv. i like when i discover movies like this, little, tender stories about ordinary people. even if the end is tragic, "the man in the moon" has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of dani, with her innocent and pure love affair with court. it's really a beautiful, moving love story with 3 high points: the performance of reese witherspoon, who maintained her promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful cinematography by the "old lion" freddie francis and the fantastic score by james newton howard, which is really the soul of the movie. his themes (which deserved an oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyric that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music.
