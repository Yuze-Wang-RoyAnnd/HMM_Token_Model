the dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. joel schumacher's 'tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, vietnam). but 'tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named bozz (played outstandingly well by colin farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves america (whereas stanley kubrick's 'full metal jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to asia). although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best film from this director that i've seen, and among the very best of its genre.
