breaking glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once. it is a very dark tale about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible. looking at some of today's 'search for a star' style tv shows on both in the uk and abroad i am always reminded of this film. though not an expert on the subject, the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there. this film predates these shows though the effect seems the same. after getting rid of her manager, played quite brilliantly by phil daniels, slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on stimulants and she is eventually totally burnt out. you potential stars of tomorrow.... watch this and beware !!!
