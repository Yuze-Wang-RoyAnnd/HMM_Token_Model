this is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like "the corporation" and "fahrenheit 9/11." its commentary is clear and unwavering as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature. the film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unsteady our world is as we rush toward an environmentally unsustainable future at lightning speed - while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress. <br /><br />truly a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children. bravo!<br /><br />nb - this is also the only film (of 8) at varsity theaters (toronto) boasting a stick-on tag which reads... "to arrange group viewings please contact...." ... a further testament to the popularity and importance of this gem.<br /><br />my bet... an academy award nomination for best documentary.<br /><br />ob101
