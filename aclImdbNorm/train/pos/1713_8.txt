this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. soha ali and abhay deol both look very beautiful. soha reminds you so much of her mother sharmila tagore. abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future.<br /><br />the ending of the movie is very different from most movies. in a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms, you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie. otherwise, it would have been gross injustice to everyone. <br /><br />the movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court. her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness. slowly slowly, over the time, he falls in love for her. it is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not. watch the movie for complete details. <br /><br />the movie really belongs to abhay. i look forward to seeing more movies from him. soha is pretty but did not speak much in the movie. her eyes, her innocence did most of the talking.
