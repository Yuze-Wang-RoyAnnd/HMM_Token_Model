cute idea... salesgirl linda smith (yolande donlan) inherits a teeny tiny little county of lampidorra. that country, which wasn't even in north america, was made the 49th state... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since this was made in 1952...) linda travels to the country she has inherited, and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people. at one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people the navajo, and it gets ever-more sillier from there.... although yolande donlan's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared. there are other songs scattered through-out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess. filmed in a glorious british version of technicolor, or some such equivalent, about the only big name here is dirk bogarde as british subject tony craig, cheese vendor. bogarde made a big splash in the uk film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by qe ii. craig and "the new princess" keep bumping into each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as lampidorra's financial problems worsen... fun little farce....along the lines of marx brothers film. also note that donlan later married val guest, the writer and director of our little project, and stayed married for 50 years! guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi flicks, in both the uk & the us.
