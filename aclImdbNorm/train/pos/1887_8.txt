arthur is middle aged rich 'kid' who drinks like a fish. arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind. he likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat. he spends money on people he don't know and finds everything funny. arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress liza minnelli (she looks really weird).<br /><br />this is a damn funny film. i watched this film because a very famous indian film 'sharabee' is based on the character of arthur. although 'sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'arthur' i think they are two different films. 'arthur' is just fun. its very corny at times. there are so many fantastic one liners in the film. its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments. my favorite scene is when arthur meets his fianc'e's father and he keeps talking about the 'moose'. duddley moore sure has some comic timing. he is very good with words and body language. i loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a 'small' country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions. john gielgud got an oscar for this film. i don't know that actor. i don't think he did a great job but may be if i watched more of his work i may agree in future. movie has some flat patches but not very long ones. looking forward to watch the sequel.
