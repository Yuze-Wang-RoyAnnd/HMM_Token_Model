now this is more like it! the first movie had some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting, but it seems like the team behind this got their stuff together for the sequel and put out a solid, thoroughly enjoyable, hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way through.<br /><br />seriously, this is just full of great stuff, brimming with creativity, and it's less of a spoof on 80s movies at the same time. the scenes in hell are great, and so are the ones in heaven. there's really no shortage to the mad-cap adventurous romp that this one promises, and you will never see another movie like this. even the hammy final act of the movie isn't as bad as the first one, being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely clich'e repertoire of family fun movie bliss. and even keanu reeves, despite looking about 30, isn't that bad here.<br /><br />sounds like a good deal to me.
