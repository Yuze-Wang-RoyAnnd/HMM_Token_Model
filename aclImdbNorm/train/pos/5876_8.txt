now i really liked this movie, it was so funny.both akshay kumar and john abraham are brilliant actors, i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future.<br /><br />akshay kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time, but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch, he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy's like this one in the future, john abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really good actor. i just love john, neha dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well.<br /><br />the muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone.
