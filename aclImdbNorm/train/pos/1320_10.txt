in the early to mid 1970's, clifford irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of howard hughes,claiming to have spent months preparing for the book,engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire. when all of this turned out to be false,irving was accused of perjury & spent several years behind bars (although always admitting his findings were accurate). flash forward to 20001,several months prior to september 11th, a book,entitled 'forbidden love' (published in the u.s. as 'honor lost:love and death in modern day jordan') by a previously unknown author by the name of norma khouri,a woman from jordan,who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend dalia,due to the fact that dalia,being from a devout muslim background,was dating a christian man. it,like irving's biography on hughes was revealed as a potential hoax. australian film maker,anna broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was khouri's attempts to clear herself of the lie(s). over the time frame of 104 minutes,the film attempts to reveal is norma khouri telling the truth,or is she just a compulsive liar,with an agenda/vendetta of her own?. interview footage with those who know/knew her (including an ex husband,her publisher,and others) tell their side of the story. this is a toothsome,well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties. not rated,but contains pervasive bad language & a re-enactment of the grisly murder scene,played over a few times (but nothing nearly as graphic & disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic,such as saw:part 84). not a good choice for the little ones.
