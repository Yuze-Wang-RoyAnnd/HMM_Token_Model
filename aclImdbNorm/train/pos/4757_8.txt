rod serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development. there are no such shows now, but rather "housewife" sluts ala eva longoria or terri hatcher, or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens.<br /><br />jack elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that i can't help but think that rod serling was tailoring that long ago week's show around elam, even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story. this episode ends with a twist, as usual, but shock and humor are mixed with especially "serlingesque" dexterity.<br /><br />rex lewis field
