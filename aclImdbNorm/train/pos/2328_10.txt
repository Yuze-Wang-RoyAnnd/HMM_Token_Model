perfect movies are rare. even my favorite films tend to have flaws - rear window looks a little stagey at times, chris elliot's character in groundhog day doesn't work, the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy, the beginning of nights of cabiria is a little too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish. <br /><br />the script is brilliant, the acting is superb all around (although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), the directing and the photography are inspired, and the music score is touching without being intrusive (like some miramax scores that are too manipulative). every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. this truly is one of the best films i have ever seen and i wish there were more films like it. <br /><br />i am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but i am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems. brilliant! a must-see.
