quick and simple, i love this movie.<br /><br />as some others have mentioned, i also, am not from the south, don't really care for country music and have never worn a cowboy hat. (i've never drove around in a car with a dead body in my trunk either, but i love "goodfellas.") this is just great film making. shot in a 2.35 aspect ratio and beautifully transfered to dvd. (the vhs was 1.33 full screen). and yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure. what can you say about this movie?<br /><br />it's just a great love/hate story set in texas, with great performances. travolta is fantastic. next to "pulp fiction", it's the best thing he's done. it's been in my top 5 for 25 years!!<br /><br />check this one out!!! it's a 10 !!!!
