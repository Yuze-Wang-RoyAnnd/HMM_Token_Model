the first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model betty page are very interesting. betty, as portrayed with enormous sincerity by gretchen mol, comes across as a pleasant, girl-next-door type, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly wasn't anything "wrong" with it). director mary harron, who also made "i shot andy warhol" and "american psycho", recreates betty's america by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, degraded, black and white footage. once betty lands in florida and starts working with bunny yeager, color is introduced. betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with paula and irving klaw (lili taylor, in a great performance, and chris bauer), as well as john willie (jared harris). the scenes where harron recreates betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed. the early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight "community". betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety, although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world. because the film's third act is virtually non-existent, we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on betty page rather than a structured drama. flaws aside, it's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer christine vachon.
