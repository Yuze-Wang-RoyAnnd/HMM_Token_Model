i enjoyed it. in general, i'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but i do like whoopi. i'm also partial to sci/fi fantasy. and the dinosaur craze. i read for pleasure, but when i'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead, i watch tv & movies to escape. theodore rex enabled me to do so. that makes it a success in my eyes! i didn't even walk away to do something else while it was running. whether or not it was rated as "good" or not doesn't really matter to me. and no, i'm not a juvenile. nor am i a moron.
