this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi; after watching it on youtube that is. set in the distant past after the ice age, it is a prehistoric sword-and-sorcery quest between good and evil. nekron, lord of the realm of ice and his mother queen juliana, has set their sights on conquest of the known world. when their glaciers destroy's the village of a man named larn, he (larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the ice lord. meanwhile, the sub-human minions of nekron and juliana capture firekeep's king jarol's sultry daughter princess teegra; but she manages to escape, and eventually meets with larn, who promises to escort her back to firekeep; if the sub-humans don't find them first.<br /><br />this movie did very little box office (as did most of ralph bakshi's films), but has become a cult classic, partly for the quality of the art, a collaboration between ralph bakshi and the famed fantasy artist frank frazetta. also, i have heard that the screenplay was written by gerry conway and roy thomas, the two men who had done conan comic book stories, and the background painters included james gurney, the illustrator of the dinotopia novels; though admittedly i had never read conan or dinotopia. and also the painter thomas kinkade, noted for his artwork for figurines, music-boxes for the bradford exchange company besides paintings. and like bakshi's films the lord of the rings and american pop, this movie was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this film than in the former.<br /><br />so overall, i think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made, and an awesome collaboration between two great minds - ralph bakshi and frank frazetta. with plenty of fantasy, sexual innuendo, and thrilling adventure.
