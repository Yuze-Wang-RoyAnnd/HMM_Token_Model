well, this is an ivan reitman film. with the rare exception, ivan likes to entertain. his films generally aren't "deep", but they are often entertaining enough. my super ex-girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would. uma thurman is just so grand, and i love her portrayals. i like luke wilson too, and rainn wilson was a straight hoot. never taking itself seriously, the film is over the top and yet isn't very unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before.... it's a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie, especially if you have a headache and don't want to strain your brain. it's escapist fun and there's nothing wrong with that. when you strip away the "super-girl" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships gone bad. it's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. and in the end, the characters are looking for love. not all of them take being "dumped" as well as they could....a slice of life with a twist.
