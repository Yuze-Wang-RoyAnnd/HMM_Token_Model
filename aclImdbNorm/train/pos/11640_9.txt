what i liked best in this film is that like the films of hitchcock, it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously.<br /><br />hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time. something that hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. this is a thriller, but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera.<br /><br />rachel mcadams is wonderful as always. cillian murphy is creepier than he was in batman begins. in the old days, there were guys who always played the bad guy. we don't see much of that these days because i suspect the hollywood agents consider it a bad career move, but cillian murphy is really good at being bad.<br /><br />the directing is surprising stylish. the story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up.<br /><br />"red eye" is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling. if you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller, "red eye" might be your ticket.
