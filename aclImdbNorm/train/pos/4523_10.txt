when i heard that adrian pasdar was in drag in this movie, my expectations that i would watch the entire movie were low. the only reasons i gave it a chance were the magnificent julie walters and the recommendation of a friend.<br /><br />what i thought would be a broad "mrs. doubtfire" type of farce turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy. pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man who needs to release the female part of his being by cross-dressing on occasions. he transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion. julie walters is magnificent, is as her habit, as the landlady who teaches him unconditional love.
