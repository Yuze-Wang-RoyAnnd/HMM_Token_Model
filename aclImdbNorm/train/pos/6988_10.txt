this is one movie that will take time to get out of your head once you have seen it. the dialogs are close to perfect, which was to be expected as it has been adapted from a play. the actors are simply giving their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure bliss!<br /><br />yvan attal is totally credible in his role, sandrine kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so dumb) providing as much pleasure to the eyes as to the ears, jean-paul rouve is providing an excellent approximation of the total jerk (and proud to be such), and marina fois is the dumb friend who is always blundering when you expect it least.<br /><br />thumbs up to bernard rapp and associates for adapting this excellent play, and all the best for future productions!<br /><br />i wish there were more of these in nowadays production. if you liked it, you will also probably enjoy: "un air de famille", and "cuisine et dependances". both were written and played by the couple bacri/jaoui.
