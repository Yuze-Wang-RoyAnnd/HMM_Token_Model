i don't give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has. i found the entire series on mysoju.com and thought the premise looked interesting so i took a look see. i wasn't disappointed in what i saw; i was moved. this story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes. sumire iwaya, played thoughtfully by koyuki, shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown. no one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate. so instead she substitutes a human, played by an adorable matsumoto jun, as a pet. this pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet. the difference; he can retaliate in the same way, after all momo is a man, not a dog. as he is treated like a pet, he reacts to situations how a dog might react. she spends time with the new boyfriend, momo gets jealous. it's when she realizes that her pet isn't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick - momo is a dance prodigy. her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts. matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning, to two dimensional when we see he's a dancer, to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man, not as a dog. in my opinion, it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop. plus matsumoto plays momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too. neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as momo (the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy) states
