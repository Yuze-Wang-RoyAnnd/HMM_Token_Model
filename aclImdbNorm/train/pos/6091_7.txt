like ishtar and king of comedy, other great, misunderstood comedies, envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially, losers (may be too harsh a word, i will call them suburban under-achievers).<br /><br />this film was a dark comedy gem, and i'm not sure what people expect. i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn't filled with obvious humor, and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile. the look on stiller's face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment, a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. there were a lot of great scenes (the j-man's decrepit "cabin by the lake", corky's unceremonious burial, weitz's wife role, and walken's j-man -- all great stuff.<br /><br />i can't stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one. i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year (save napoleon dynamite.) it's wittier, wackier, and an offbeat, enjoyable gem.<br /><br />remember this people; most times, popular doesn't equal good.
