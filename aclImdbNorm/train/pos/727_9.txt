one of the best if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever. and it's not just mindless fun. there really were a lot of clever jokes in it. of course i love the ramones. but with all the "anarchy" and the "i hate high school" themes, the film doesn't at all take itself too seriously,which is what's great about it.<br /><br />i first saw the movie in the spring of 1980, and i saw it again recently. since i went to high school in the late 1970's, it made me kind of nostalgic. <br /><br />like i said, this film doesn't take itself that seriously and isn't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies, eighties, and nineties. and to speak of, it's not really dirty or disgusting either. only pg rated. that's rare for a movie in this category. a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule.
