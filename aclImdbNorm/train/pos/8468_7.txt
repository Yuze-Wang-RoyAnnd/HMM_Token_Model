a surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia. there's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes, but it works. the scares are very subtle, not the jump-cut scares that seem to populate most recent asian horror films. the way the "scares" are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in "the uninvited" (aka 4 inyong shiktak, directed by su-leon lee), but this isn't nearly to the same caliber. the film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. it's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do. i would recommend checking it out if you get a chance.
