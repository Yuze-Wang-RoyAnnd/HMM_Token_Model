everyone knows about this ''zero day'' event. what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were. they showed their life for about a year. throughout the movie we get to like them, to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do. and that gives me the chills. cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments, and i just thought cal was a sweet guy. even though i knew what was gonna happen you know? even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off. of course i was. i got to like them. they were wicked, maybe, but i felt like they were really normal guys, that they didn't really realize it. but i knew they were.<br /><br />that's, imo, the main force of this movie. it makes us realize that our friends, or relatives, or anyone, can be planning something crazy, and that we won't even notice it. this movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. and that's why i can't go to sleep right now. there's still this little feeling in my stomach. butterflies.
