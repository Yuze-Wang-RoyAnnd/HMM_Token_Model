i've read most of the comments on this movie. i have seen this movie(and the whole prophecy series) many times with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times. no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some posts. the movie is just based on biblical facts. i have seen a lot of end time movies "tribulation", "armagedon" and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths. it may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but i believe it is a good witnessing tool. this movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraise.com, and judge for yourself. blessings to all.
