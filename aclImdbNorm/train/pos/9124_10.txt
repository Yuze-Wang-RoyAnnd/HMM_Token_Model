bar some of the questionable acting (there musicians at the end of the day), this in the words of quentin tarrinno is "the best rock movie ever made...period"<br /><br />think 8 mile, but without the rapping - a young musician, trying to prove himself to the local community, whilst struggling to cope with a broken home and a rival band. throw in the sex interest and the truly exceptional performances, this is the real 8 mile.<br /><br />prince provides a solid performance, as does morris day and jerome benton. decent script, good direction, great plot, and spectacular performances. not forgetting the some of the best rock/pop/funk music you will ever hear.
