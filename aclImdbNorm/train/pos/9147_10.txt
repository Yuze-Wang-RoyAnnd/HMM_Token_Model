as a big-time prince fan of the last three to four years, i really can't believe i've only just got round to watching "purple rain". the brand new 2-disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it. wow, i was really looking forward to watching it, but i wasn't prepared for just how electric it actually is. prince's musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding - he really has the moves in this one. i am very familiar (from repeated listens) with the classic "purple rain" album and all its songs, but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics - like computer blue, the beautiful ones, when doves cry and purple rain itself. there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform. the closing songs baby i'm a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid-20s (he's overflowing!), it blew me away. it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years.<br /><br />prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - drive her to a lake, make her jump in, then drive off - absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight.<br /><br />some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film's overall charm. morris day is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious), and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style - i love their dancing in this bit, and how benton provides morris with a mirror mid-performance.<br /><br />i already can't wait to watch it again, i really can't! extras are terrific - particularly seeing a young eddie murphy pre-beverly hills cop admit he is a "prince groupie".
