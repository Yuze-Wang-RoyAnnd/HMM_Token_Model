this movie is to halloween what the hilarious "christmas story" is to christmas: both are relatively low-budget, no-big-name-stars type films...and both are two of the absolute greatest and funniest movies available, both seasonal classics!!! "spaced invaders" comes galloping out right from the start with warmth and humor and a superb cast of characters...all five goofy martians, klembecker the realtor, russell the deputy, vern at the "fuel dispensing depot" and so many more! you just have to see this movie to believe it, and, like "christmas story", it just keeps getting better and better with each viewing, and you pick up on fun little things each time!! most definitely a ten!!!
