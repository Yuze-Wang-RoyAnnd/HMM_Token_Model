an mgm miniature short subject.<br /><br />the editor of the cole county clarion must decide what is the real important news for his readers: an impending frost which may spell disaster to their crops, or the sensational shooting-down of a notorious gangster on their small town main street.<br /><br />this is an enjoyable little one-reeler, featuring a good performance by comic charles `chic' sale. today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited james stewart, as sale's nephew/assistant. slow talking & somewhat goofy, stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time.<br /><br />often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios' feature films.
