national lampoon's class reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's which combines unique characters, lots of laughs, and some great music from chuck berry. when walter bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at their high school graduation he seizes the opportunity to get his revenge at his class reunion. one by one he stalks his classmates who include an innocent blind girl, a horny fat guy, the high school beauty, the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slops to all the kids during highschool. this film has a sort of scary element in it and it has a few brief scenes of sexuality so i wouldn't recommend it for young children but it's a great movie for teens. if you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters or killer special effects you might not love class reunion. if you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and a lot of fun (and who doesn't) then this movie should be on your movies to see list. ++
