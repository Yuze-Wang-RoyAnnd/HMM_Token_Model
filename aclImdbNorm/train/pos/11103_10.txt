"the godfather" of television, but aside from it's acclaim and mobster characters, the two are nothing alike. tony soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. his psychiatrist learns that tony is actually part of two families -- in one family he is a loving father yet not-so-perfect-husband, and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy. after analysis, dr. melfi concludes that tony's problems actually derive from his mother livia, who's suspected to have borderline-personality disorder. gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character; yet bracco and marchand aren't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother, respectively. falco, imperioli and dematteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles. van zandt (from the e-street band) plays his first and only role as tony's best friend, and is quite convincing and latching. chianese, the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a godfather film, plays tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis. many fans also enjoyed characters played by pastore, ventimiglia, curatola, proval, pantoliano, lip, sciorra and buscemi. tony's children are "okay" but not notable (with the exception of iler's stunning performance in the third-to-last episode, "the second coming"); sirico and schirripa are unconvincing and over-the-top, but the show is too strong for them to hold it back. even as the show continues for over six season, it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment.<br /><br />**** (out of four)
