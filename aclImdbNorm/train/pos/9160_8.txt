in all the comments praising or damning dalton's performance, i thought he was excellent. he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy, but as a roguish, powerful man. i liked this version, although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting, and the scenes with jane and st. john never quite gelled. i give this an 8.
