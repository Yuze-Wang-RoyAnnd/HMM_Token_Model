after going for a bike ride that day, lying beside a lake in a nature reserve, spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it, this film made absolute sense to me.<br /><br />the imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need. switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done.<br /><br />reminded me of baraka (1992) but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph.<br /><br />this comment requires a minimum of ten lines, ten lines is the minimum not 9 lines but ten. after finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment.
