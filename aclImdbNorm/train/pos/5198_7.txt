what can be said about mr. moore? he's the godfather of rap, he's the king of the z-level blaxploitation flicks, and here, he is back as his most famous character, dolemite! can you dig it? this movie is one whacked-out roller-coaster ride of politically incorrect humor, trippy kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence, and a whole lot of other stuff you'd never find in most modern movies (or any movies, really, haha!). the stand-up routine he gives early on is not to be missed! at any rate, d2 is definitely an entertaining way to waste an hour or so. dolemite: "he think he's bad and ain't got no class! i'm gon' rock this shotgun up his *beep* a**!"
