old people show???? i'm 15 and have been watching the show since i was 12, recoding it onto my sky+ box everyday from hallmark and bbc 1. i really wish they hadn't cancelled it, they didn't even get a proper farewell. but what an adventure, all those episodes, i think i've seen them all, and not one comes to mind that i didn't like and enjoy.<br /><br />its a shame the bbc keep swapping between diagnoses murder and 'murder she wrote'- never watched it and don't intend to. anyways, he characters in diagnoses murder are so in-depth, and the chemistry between the actors is amazing. it really was a sad day when they cancelled this show........
