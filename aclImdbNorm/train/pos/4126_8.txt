what a night. perry mason then have gun, will travel followed by gunsmoke (when it was a half hour) and finally at 10:30pm came 'sea hunt' with its wonderful opening theme music and mike's boat sailing off to a new adventure. terrific.. regardless of the story it was the lead character (played by lloyd bridges), strong, honest, sincere. a man's man and a boy's man. this brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years. why they don't show on cable or make it available on video, no idea.. too bad.
