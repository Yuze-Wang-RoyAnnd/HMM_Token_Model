low budget brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much. good cast and a sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before. several scenes are a bit hysterical and o'connor's voice sounds a lot like mini mouse! she disappeared from sight soon after making this movie - so life can imitated art! a must see if you want to see a punk version of a star is born though.
