i gave this movie such a high mark because it was really cute, really funny, all while being unpretentious. i went to see this film when it was playing in the philly area, and it was the centerpiece of a great night out with friends. the film is well written and well acted, and though it does feel a bit like a sitcom rather then a movie, that doesn't take away from the film. you just don't find comedies like this anymore, where you don't have to shock people to be funny. the film centers around a ukranian housekeeper that finds herself working for a young couple in need of help. though at first she helps, soon she adds more craziness to their lives then the couple bargained for. things get further and further out of control until....you'll have to see! the banter had me laughing, even after leaving the theater. this film just put me in a good mood. i can't wait until it is released on dvd because i want this movie in my collection.
