i originally came across linda feferman's seven minutes in heaven when i was 14 and worked at a video store and i loved it. i recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure. the movie stars jennifer connelly, almost twenty years before she would go on to win an oscar for beautiful mind, as natalie becker. byron thames plays her best friend in the world, jeff moran. the film is definitely a milder, cuter and softer version of the pretty in pink's and some kind of wonderful's of the 1980's, which is exactly why it is so good. it's honest, not forced like those films, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kids.<br /><br />when natalie's dad leave home on a business trip, jeff convinces her that he should move in because his home life sucks. with support from natalie's friend, polly, played exquisitely by maddie corman, she lets him. but this movie isn't about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can get away with. the three leads are so natural and the script, surprisingly so honest, that what comes through best in their performances is heart breaking. these characters really do care about each other. it's a great film to show to kids who are reaching pre-teen adolescence.<br /><br />
