"and the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom" - anais nin marcel proust says, "the real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes." author and screenwriter antwone fisher joined the u.s. navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes. based on his autobiography "finding fish" written many years after the events, his story is dramatized in the film antwone fisher, denzel washington's first directorial effort. it is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one's past to being able to live life in present time.<br /><br />required to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base, the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up antwone (derek luke) recounts his life in sessions with navy psychiatrist jerome davenport (denzel washington). he is at first unwilling to talk, but when he begins, the floodgates are opened. after his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison, he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years, suffering humiliation and sexual abuse. according to antwone, the treatment by his foster mother mrs. tate (novella nelson) who referred to him only as "nigga" and by his cousin nadine (yolonda ross) was in fact much worse than shown on the screen.<br /><br />the only friend he has is a local by named jesse (jascha washington) who, later in the film, only adds to his feelings of abandonment. it is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in ordinary people and good will hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of washington and luke, though the film's attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile. davenport's humanity and warmth, however, allows fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and cheryl (joy bryant), his new girlfriend who is also in the navy, supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthrough.<br /><br />with cheryl's help and dr. davenport's counseling, antwone develops enough self-esteem to return to cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past. what comes through in derek luke's incredible performance is antwone's longing for acceptance, dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him. comedian mort sahl once said that "people just have to remember what we're all here for: to find our way home..." antwone fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep, not knowing the joy of being loved.
