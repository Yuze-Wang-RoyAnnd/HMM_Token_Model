this is one of the funniest series ever! i laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor. if only someone would release in america. region 0 or 1 - non-pal please. <br /><br />i know it being released in the uk but that's region 2 and pal besides! let's give this series its fair shake. america must know this series. moffat is a genius. i loved tracie bennett's quirky, goofy role in this. of course i liked fiona gillies! but tracie was a treasure!<br /><br />release this show in america! or show it again on the pbs stations. i need to laugh and laugh again! please indulge us, please! please!<br /><br />thanks for reading.
