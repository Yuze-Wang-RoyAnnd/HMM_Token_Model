this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me. it's witty jokes and even it's occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on eastern european people had me in stitches throughout most of the film. it's plot is clever and 100% original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film. the one person i was most impressed with in this film was hilary duff. it's plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the 'chick-flick' genre she's used to. her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well-executed. it is the best performance i have ever seen from hilary, and i have seen most of her films. her character, yonica babyyeah is described as 'the britney spears of eastern europe' and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song, 'i want to blow you... ... ... up'. you also feel sorry for her, as her performance really grasps you, yonica is a very complex and confused character. joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour, but also her facial expressions and so on. john cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout. i strongly recommend this film.
