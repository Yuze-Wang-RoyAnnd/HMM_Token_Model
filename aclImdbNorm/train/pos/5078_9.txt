this one stood out for it's originality. i'm seriously tired of seeing hindi movies that are a hotch-potch of a whole bunch of hollywood and brit movies. some flaws were inevitable, nonetheless, this movie is a must-see. surya's portrayal of the clean-cut, conscientious cop (as opposed to the pot-bellied, money-hungry ones that we normally see) was awesome. he's come a long way from his work in nerukku ner. i liked the movie so much that i had to own it. i'm not usually into the mindless violence type of movies, somehow i actually felt for each character and therefore can't really bring myself to call it 'mindless' violence. i do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most hindi and tamil movies. i absolutely loved this movie for it's lack of the same. acp anbuselvan's reaction to loosing his wife, is not overdone, is heart-wrenching and makes me want to bawl my eyes out. there are certain times when i'm watching a movie when i want to hit the ff button. plenty of times i've wanted to do that at a cinema hall. never wanted to do so when watching this movie. i'm really hoping that ghajini releases soon.
