dead to rights is about a police officer named jack slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him.jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father.<br /><br />several months later on the day jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder.jack's search leads him through a trail of *beep* that doesn't end until everyone is dead.<br /><br />through out the game jack uses weapons from m4 carbines to his dog shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels.the game play is basically "kill 30 people,find switch to open door.kill 50 people,find switch to open door" over and over until the level is done.there are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a night club so jack can get to another area in the club,or bomb disarming.<br /><br />dead to rights is also a hard game.you will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with sub machine guns while you only have a pistol.near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck.<br /><br />dead to rights is as gory as it is hard.if you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls,ceiling and floor.and since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood.<br /><br />family fun for everyone.
