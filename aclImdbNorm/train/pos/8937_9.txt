this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects. just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent century.<br /><br />this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc.<br /><br />good movie with a good message.
