i am a big fan a faerie tale theatre and i've seen them all and this is one of the best! it's funny, romantic, and a classic. i recommend this for all ages. it's great for little kids because it's well, cinderella and great for adults and teen because it's funny and not over the top. i watched it when i was little and i still watch it now. it has great lines that my family and i quote all the time. the acting is great and it never gets old. if you like fairy tales and romances you will love this. i've watched many a cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all. (sorry disney) i highly recommend this movie and all the faerie tale theatre shows. they all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining.
