overall the film is ok. i think it's better than sepet and much better than gubra in term of its story, its sentimental value.<br /><br />there are a few scenes that makes me touched. yes i agree that the boy (mukhsin) did his acting very good. brilliant. i can say that his acting is almost natural.<br /><br />however, the song 'ne me quitte pas' by nina simone really "'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma' ".<br /><br />i love the song. both the song. "ne me quitte pas" and "hujan". i just downloaded the song. beautiful.<br /><br />and salute to yasmin. the movie's ending credit makes me touched again. we can see how yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way.<br /><br />i think the movie deserves that grand prix of international jury at berlin film festival.<br /><br />i give 8.5 out of 1o stars.
