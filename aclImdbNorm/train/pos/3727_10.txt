tigerland is one of the finest films that i have seen, and in my opinion it outdoes even full metal jacket, a film of similar nature. bozz is played exceptionally well by farrell, and is a character who stays in your mind long after the film ends. the ending is brilliantly cut by schumacher - with the melodic harmony singing and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave. what a film.
