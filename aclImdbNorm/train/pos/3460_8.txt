the story for the first-aired television installment of "columbo" is simple: one-half of successful mystery-writing team does away with the other, frames an unseen mafia group, is blackmailed by an admirer, does away with the admirer, and is tricked up by the stalwart columbo.<br /><br />with that said, this is still one of the most entertaining in the show's history, benefiting tremendously by the work of the late jack cassidy and star peter falk.<br /><br />besides the notability of being directed by a young steven spielberg, the episode also has a air of the macabre because of the future of two of its stars: cassidy and barbara colby. the two share several scenes together and it is poignant that both would die tragically within a decade of this filming, cassidy in an apartment fire and colby at the hands of assailants, yet to be found after over three decades.<br /><br />now, both demises are true-life mysteries!
