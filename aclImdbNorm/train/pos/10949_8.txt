first and foremost i would like to say that i'm a huge sarah silverman fan, and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me. everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form, maybe not directly funny, but the situation and the delivery are what counts.<br /><br />if you liked jesus is magic then i don't see how you wouldn't like this. it has that same flow and that same rhythm. true it's only for the true fans, but if you are you'll be pleased.<br /><br />again only for the true fans, there's no way around that. if you're not used to her style then you wouldn't get why this is funny. however, it is, and i hope you think so too.
