this is simply the funniest movie i've seen in a long time. the bad acting, bad script, bad scenery, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughter.<br /><br />so it's not gonna win an oscar but if you've got beer and friends round then you can't go wrong.
