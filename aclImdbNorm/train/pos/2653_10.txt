kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on stephen king's book titled the same way. jack torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism. the overlook hotel in colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. but, the manager advised torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family. even before they got there, his son danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasn't good and didn't want to go. once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed. at this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to danny, and someone who attacked him violently. they are not alone in this place. later on, jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, delbert grady. grady tells torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel. obeying this order, jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things i've ever seen happen here. the ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute.
