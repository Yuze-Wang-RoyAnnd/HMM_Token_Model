the ancient mariner is a truly classic piece of work, as the original poem was/is. the context/setting with the old mariner himself is fine, clear, and without pretense. the artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly the time/period of the setting and of the work itself, carrying the audience into the period with a still, yet moving accompaniment, using excellent still-movement strategies only well conquered by the pre-mtv era producers and much less apparent in more current works. (mtv brought to television and video a static movement that races through, often irrelevant cuts, from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships to theme or storyline.) the voice, intonation and vitality of redgrave's reading brings this touching poem to life with all its fear, strife and pain. in addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and occasional monotone (in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself)of the author's rendition of the ancient mariner's sad and spooky tale. this is a must for any love of classic poetry, the sea, a tall tale, that almost rings true, and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. who does not understand the meaning of an "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" a truly fine experience. thank you mr. dasilva for bringing this to life for us, never to be forgotten.
