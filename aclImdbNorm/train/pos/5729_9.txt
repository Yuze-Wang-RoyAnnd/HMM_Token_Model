this is a bit of a puzzle for a lot of the artsy lynch crowd. they tend to try to write this off as some kind of meaningless, crude, side project of lynch's. like this is lynch passing gas between his real pieces of film art. well it may be a fart, but its one of those intriguing farts that you catch of a whiff of and are embarrassed to admit you enjoy.<br /><br />dumbland distilled down beyond this is art. what can you do with aspects of modern life but laugh at it. if you took it seriously you would go nuts. you hook into it, smell it, taste it, feel its agonies, its unreasoning stupidities, and then express it in any medium you choose. thats called art, and art isn't dumb. but it is dumbland.
