probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life, and i enjoyed it. the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. mozambique, angola, and guinea (bissau)- cape vert. most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including spinola, who took over as the new president. the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.
