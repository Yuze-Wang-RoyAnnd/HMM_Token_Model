having borrowed this movie from the local library a couple of weeks ago intending to originally see this on or a few days after memorial day, i finally got to seeing sayonara just this morning. in this one marlon brando plays major lloyd "ace" gruver, a general's son who's been raised a certain way, being transfered from korea to japan where his girlfriend eileen webster (patricia owens) conveniently happens to be. before leaving, he tries to persuade one of his men, a joe kelly (red buttons), out of marrying japanese woman katsumi (miyoshi umeki) since that's a violation of military fraternization laws. with the romance of him and eileen on the outs, however, ace not only becomes the best man at joe and katsumi's wedding, he falls for an asian himself after he and captain mike bailey (james garner) go out on the town and watch headlining entertainer hana-ogi (miiko taka) on stage. bailey himself is dating one of the dancers, fumiko-san (reiko kuba). eileen herself seems to have a fancy for one of the kabuki performers, nakamura (ricardo montalban). i'll stop right there and say that this was a mostly compelling drama about the prejudices concerning american-asian relations of romance that was very touching from beginning to end. even seeing hispanic montalban playing an oriental isn't too embarrassing (though it's a good thing his part is short). and there's some nice touches of humor like that of brando's head hitting the top of button's and umeki's inside doorway more than once. red and miyoshi themselves deserve their oscars especially red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout. rookie garner, before being cast in his legendary role on tv's "marverick", is fine in his scenes with brando and miiko taka shows great restraint in her initial characterization as an anti-american. while i've read there were some changes from james michener's novel, i can't imagine director josha logan, who had previously adopted another michener work into the broadway musical "south pacific" and would eventually make that into a movie as well, not staying true to the original source. he certainly provided some inspiration with the ending scenes that made the heartbreaking earlier tragedy in the film a somewhat necessary plot twist. some of the production numbers may have made the movie a little longish but otherwise, sayonara was wonderful educational experience about the '50s mores that permeated america and japan at the time.
