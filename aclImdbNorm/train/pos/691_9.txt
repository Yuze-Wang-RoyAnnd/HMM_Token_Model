i'll come clean. the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine. when i heard the title of the film, i thought it was going to be...different, perhaps in not such a good way.<br /><br />but i was wrong. after reading what few reviews were out there about this short, i was actually excited about seeing it. i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later. needless to say, i was not disappointed.<br /><br />the film follows jack, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head. i won't give away what happens, but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it's realism.<br /><br />the directing is fantastic, focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought-provoking moments.<br /><br />all in all, i give this great film 9 out of 10, for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve.
