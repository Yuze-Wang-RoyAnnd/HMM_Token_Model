i read that this did not well, that the story is not solid, that volckman feels he has failed in some way.<br /><br />i disagree. first, it is well executed. volckman is doing well to not only to try a new technique, but to have a focus that is worth thinking about: would immortality reduce the value of life? big question ...<br /><br />i can see he trying hard to build a feeling, and he is not compromising. this is to be applauded. i am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form. i have seen artists reduce a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment. i identify this film with this.<br /><br />further, it is much more interesting than richard linklater's roto-scoping, and volckman's story has more meaning than linklater's later stories of a wasted life on drugs. old news. everyone knows it, but no one does anything about it. renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. and there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far better.<br /><br />well done, volckman. really nice work.
