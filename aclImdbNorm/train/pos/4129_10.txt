it's a cooking competition show, americanized. it's not going to be the japanese version.<br /><br />the show is great. i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch... from the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman. truly a good way to spend some time watching tv. <br /><br />you could critique the show for having guests like marc ecko as a judge... but... meh. it's entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize. <br /><br />oh yeah and i'm bitter john besh isn't the new iron chef... <br /><br />ala cuisine!
