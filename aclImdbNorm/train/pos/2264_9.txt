vonnegut's words are best experienced on paper. the tales he weaves are gossemar, silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn manson or jerry bruckheimer explosions. his words have been treated well once before, in the remarkable slaughterhouse-5.<br /><br />mother night is probably one of the three novels vonnegut has written i could take to a desert island, along with slaughterhouse-5 and bluebeard.<br /><br />the film version deserves a 10, but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that i just can't do it...some of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory...
