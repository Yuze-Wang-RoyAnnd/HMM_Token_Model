this is definitely an appropriate update for the original, except that "party on the left is now party on the right." like the original, this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty. it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous, and over-powerful federal government. kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge, where the us government, with the cooperation of the mainstream media, threw around words like "white supremacist" and "right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights, with the willing acquiescence of the general populace. that message is so non-pc, i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick, katherine prudhomme, the western journalism center, and countless others who dared to speak out. "live free or die" is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays "the voice," and that sums up the dangerous (to some) message of this film.<br /><br />
