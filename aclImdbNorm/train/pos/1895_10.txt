i watched this over the christmas period, i don't know why but it reminds me of christmas so i watched it, so there we are. <br /><br />arthur is a film i watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances, great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it. <br /><br />dudley moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily (spoiled, rich, lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself) but turns him into someone you love. liza minelli is great as linda morolla a queens waitress who manages to pull off the tough/soft on the inside lady arthur nearly gives up his world for. john gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish. <br /><br />i can watch arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good, check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film.
