this movie has several things going for it. it is a "feel good" story. the characters and actors are likable, realistic and present fine performances. most important, i believe, is that dennis quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball. robert redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in "the natural, and so did kevin costner in "for love of the game" and "bull durham." in "major league," tom berenger and charlie sheen looked like they knew what they were doing, but many of the others did not, and that picture was pure silliness - and not very funny. <br /><br />so many earlier baseball movies, even where the stories might be interesting, presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leads, they were ludicrous in this respect. in "the stratton story" and "strategic air command," jimmy stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player, as your overweight, non-athletic, elderly uncle in the softball game at the family reunion. other virile and physically robust stars (e.g., gary cooper as lou gehrig; robald reagan as grover cleveland alexander; and dan dailey as dizzy dean) also exhibited a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while "choosing-up" for a game at the sunday picnic (even if coed, and even if your uncle were involved). <br /><br />the scenes of quaid's high school team he coached, the ones where he attends his tryout with the devil rays, and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the american league, all ring true. the participants are believable and capable. in addition, he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization (except, to a degree, some of his "over-the-top" scenes, and his forced accent, in his portrayal of jerry lee lewis). but he's definitely on-target here, and this movie is a "9," as good, or better, as any others of this genre, except for "the natural."
