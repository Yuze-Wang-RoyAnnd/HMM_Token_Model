well, of course not, women are overly sensitive and needy on average, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly, or blatantly dwelt on. unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice. as many good films, i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing. all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd. i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much, but really, what do i care why? though i'm sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation. all right, so you may disagree, perhaps it is a bit boring at times, i'm not an expert. the blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka.
