this show is freaking hilarious! the jokes are original, god and i love eric and kelso! yeah i know what they say, after the 8th season it's not funny anymore because eric and kelso are no longer in the show, and randy is a real dumbass. randy is, comparing to eric and kelso. <br /><br />you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with "i'm a cool guy" kind of guy (randy). it isn't his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it's still is, not as much as the earlier seasons, but its alright.<br /><br />the 360's are awesome, the circle, red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad :) and kitty is always half-high half-pie. hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too. the least favrioutes characters are jackie and donna. they're cool, but not without kelso and eric.<br /><br />great show. dumbass!
