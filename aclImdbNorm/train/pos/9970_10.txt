brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day christmas ceremonies. the voyeuristic element during the scenes (santa & pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is unique (and obviously jean-luc godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film "pierrot le-fou"). highly recommended!
