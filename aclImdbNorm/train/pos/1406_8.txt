remember h.g. wells' "the invisible man"? well here's another movie like it, only more extreme. "hollow man" is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. kevin bacon plays sebastian caine, a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes. at first making the serum was the easy part, making the person come back was not. most of the first tries ended up unstable. until one night, when he perfected the formula. and who else, but caine would be the lab rat. the gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he came to, it was a close one. so when the did caine, he decided to use it for fun. then when he got tired of being not seen, the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh. however, the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should, and caine would delve into madness. so he ends up being one mad invisible killer. it would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you. i would care less about the ones who did you wrong. great movie, plenty of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
