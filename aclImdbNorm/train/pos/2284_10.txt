this is a very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. i am very impressed at the film, not just for the plot and superb acting, but that such a unique movie was made. most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking brit or a mighty battle, but not this. this isn't about this kind of war, its about the war between a man and his position in life, an american spy in germany, posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget. when the war is over, campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret. going back to america, campell meets nazi supporters as well as nazi haters, providing for interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. nolte more than pulls off the role, and fits the plot quite well for what it's asking.
