i gotta say, clive barker's undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made. i've played resident evil, silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements. barker is good at what he does, which is attach the horror to our world, and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at, undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title. i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud.
