you know, this movie isn't that great, but, i mean, c'mon, it's about angels helping a baseball team. i find the plot line to be hilarious anyways, this kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they won't) kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win, god helps the whole time (via the angel christopher lloyd, rip) and in the end, his dad doesn't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face. it's hilarious until danny glover adopts it and it's friend.<br /><br />i guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. the real winner here, though, is god. because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.<br /><br />as a kids movie, it gets a 7. as a movie about the mysteries of blind, stupid faith, and the nature of "god," it gets a 10.
