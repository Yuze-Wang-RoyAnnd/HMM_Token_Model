this was great. when i saw the japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie i had ever seen. it was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying. when the mother ghost lent over the bed in the japanese version, i nearly had a heart attack... i was concerned that the american version would be watered down, and that buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version. i needn't have been concerned. the makers of this movie wisely kept the same japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand, and gave the direction of the movie to the same man. they also set it in japan in the same location, in the same house. in fact, the japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference was the casting of american actors. that actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of "strangers in a strange land" to the overall horror. not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. it just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and i thought it was an excellent touch.<br /><br />buffy actually does a very good job. she looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. there are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to american horror movies, or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation. in fact, it was easily as good as the ring which i also thoroughly enjoyed. i hope the future of american horror follows more closely the japanese new wave of horror started with the incredible success of ringu. we are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as "horror"!! 8/10
