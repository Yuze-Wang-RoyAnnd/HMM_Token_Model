i'm a fan of crash and blade runner and this movie explores some of those highway death and 80s film noir themes that i like to see, so i enjoyed it.<br /><br />in general though, the essential stupidity of the film noir protagonist is not pulled off well by the female lead and her hero is nearly a neanderthal, hence the kitch warning.
