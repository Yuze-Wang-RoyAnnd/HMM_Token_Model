for fans of troma or the cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you! there is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film, also the effects can be impressionable and awesome. the plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these days.<br /><br />also notable are the little aliens, who i found cute. all in all, it's a good film for fans of the genre. also recommended are films such as tetsuo:the iron man and versus for that weird japanese film approach, filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed. of course, seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two.
