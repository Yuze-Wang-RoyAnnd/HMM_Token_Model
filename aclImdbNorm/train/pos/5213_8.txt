this is the first review i've wrote for imdb so bare with me, but i caught this flick on hbo and was sure glad i watched it. richard gere is great in this film as the passionate agent/detective who bends the rules to get the job done. i think the story is great, and there's never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down. some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime film like se7en, you'll be able to stomach the scenes just fine. <br /><br />so all in all, if you're looking for a good detective/suspense movie, ignore the low rating this movie got on imdb and definitely watch it.
