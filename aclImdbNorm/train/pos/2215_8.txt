i've bought, " the feast of all saints," and it's not truly a horrible movie, but a lot of things could have been better. it had a lot of historical value, played out by very talented actress/actors, and it's not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat believable. there were some parts that were a little mediocre and confusing, but i wouldn't say that the entire movie was horrible. once you think about that, capturing 1800's new orleans, and making something out of it, it pretty hard, and much harder to get actors who can strongly signify those parts. but the only big problem i had with the movie was that most of the actors who did play the free people of color, were mostly light skinned africans, not very universal in casting others who weren't light skinned; one of the old creole stereotypes that still exists. whomever did the casting could have picked a wider variety when it came to hue, despite many creoles are color conscious.rather picking actors that looked near white in a sense, could have been more thought out.the actors did a great job, the script could have better written, and overall i found the performances were very believable.
