typical de palma movie made with lot's of style and some scene's that will bring you to the edge of your seat.<br /><br />most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller, is the style. it has some brilliantly edited scene's and some scene's that are truly nerve wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat. the best scene's from the movie; the museum scene and the elevator murder. there are some mild erotic scene's and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. so this movie might not be suitable for everybody.<br /><br />the story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work! it might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie.<br /><br />there are some nice character portrayed by a good cast. michael caine is an interesting casting choice and angie dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking (not bad for a 49-year old!).<br /><br />the musical score by pino donaggio is also typically de palma like and suits the movie very well, just like his score for the other de palma movie, "body double".<br /><br />brilliant nerve wrecking thriller. i love de palma!<br /><br />10/10
