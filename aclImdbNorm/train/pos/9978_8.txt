i have to say, i loved vanishing point. i've seen the original, and this is a pretty good remake of it. even though it didn't follow the original storyline (that's why i gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline.<br /><br />as for the car, well the dj's comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable (and if you look, the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150), but even though i didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged hemi, so it's possible. for those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it, the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic.
