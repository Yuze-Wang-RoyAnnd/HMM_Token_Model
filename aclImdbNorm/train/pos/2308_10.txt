i checked this out as an impulse when browsing through the movie store and couldn't have been any more pleasantly surprised! my mom and i watched this film together, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. it isn't the typical "chick-flick" with a sappy love story and tears all the way through, but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end. it's an ending where, although unexpected and tragic, the movie's overall effect is not harmed by it. i think reese witherspoon was a great actress even in this film, her debut, and this is definitely worth watching! i didn't recognize many of the supporting actors, but they all play their important supporting roles well. "the man in the moon" is such an believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time. most women can definitely relate to everything-from witherspoon's words, her subtle glances, and her not so subtle emotions (raging like the typical teenage girl). while she's playing a character confused about love, she does not come across as silly and immature, which was much appreciated considering many movies today.
