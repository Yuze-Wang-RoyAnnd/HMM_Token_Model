when this initially aired in 1984, my wife and i taped it on our very first vhs recorder. i still have that aging tape, which i try to watch annually. it was the year my first child was born, and seeing a christmas carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times -- many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background. i finally broke down this year and ordered a dvd, which prompted me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie. charles dickens' story is captured in outstanding fashion here. george c. scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as scrooge. the supporting cast is equally spectacular. this is, to my mind, a flawless production. little details add much to the enjoyment. the game "similes" scrooge's nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item. (i've since re-created it with my high school english students as a brief respite from class work!) honestly, i can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays i enjoy more than indulging in this cbs production, which was originally sponsored by ibm. (incidentally, it's fun to watch the old tape with the original ibm commercials ... which show just how much computers have evolved in 21 years. amazing how things have changed!) bottom line: a christmas carol is a timeless story, and this rendition is a timeless classic. enjoy ... and god bless us, every one!
