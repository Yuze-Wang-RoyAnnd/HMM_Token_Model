there's perhaps a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart. having just said goodbye to my new fianc'ee - of oh...one day - for an unknown period of time, i was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the fallout from putting on the brave face she needed to see.<br /><br />i watched a few movies and tv shows, but my interest darted from what i was leaving behind to what is out there and what i haven't seen. for that, i have this movie to thank.<br /><br />being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand, i was sure i was going to like it anyway. but i didn't just like it, i loved it.<br /><br />the technical mastery is astounding. how did they do it? how did they capture the animals in the way they did?? it's just wonderful.<br /><br />the moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so french and ambiguous, it's a happy/sad one. again, it caught me a bit off-guard. as a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people i would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours! perhaps it's because the ending made me think back to what i left.<br /><br />but for those few hours on the plane, i was happy to see something new and original. and that's life. sure, there are those things you love and feel comfortable around...but the great outdoors holds many a mystery. so the next time i see something out of the ordinary while out in the open; i'm going to explore it, observe it and embrace it. that's precisely what happens in this movie and that's precisely what you should do with this darn good movie/nature doc too. 8/10 <br /><br />p.s. it's two months on from the plane journey. we still don't know when we'll see each other again, but we will.
