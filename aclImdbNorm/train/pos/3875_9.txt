this movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in canada, yves p. pelletier. i was shocked for a second that he made a romantic comedy, but knowing he was a heavy cinephile, was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque, i had a positive feeling about this movie.<br /><br />hell, i was right. right off the bat, the scenario (written by pelletier himself) is a bit twisted and hard to follow, but, in pelletier's fashion it's a one-of-a-kind 90 minutes jack-in-the-box.<br /><br />loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to dangerous liaisons (by laclos) "les aimants" consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge. throughout the movie you'll get the occasion to find out who's who and who's writing to who on that goddam fridge....which pops up in an interesting love affair.<br /><br />great storyline, great photography, great quotations of other movies. should we ask more for a first movie?
