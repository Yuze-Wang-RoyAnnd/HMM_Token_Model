this is what i was expecting when star trek ds9 premiered. not to slight ds9. that was a wonderful show in it's own right, however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted. enterprise is that show. while having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it's own ways. it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again. and that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved. another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members. viewers really cared deeply for the crew. enterprise has much promise in this area as well. the chemistry between bakula and blalock seems very promising. while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical. i think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even, we get some very interesting ideas and television. also, we should note the performances, blalock is very convincing as vulcan t'pol and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance. the rest of the cast delivered good performances also. my only gripes are as follows. the theme. it's good it's different, but a little to light hearted for my liking. we need something a little more grand. doesn't have to be orchestral. maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice. and my one other complaint. they sell too many adds. they could fix this by selling less ads, or making all shows two parters. otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of voyager.
