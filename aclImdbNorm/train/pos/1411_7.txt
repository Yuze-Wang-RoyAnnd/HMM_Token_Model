greetings again from the darkness. stunning photography highlights this disney documentary and provides a glimpse into some of the harshness of animals that live in the wilderness. for anyone over 40, disney and mutual of omaha's wild kingdom provided much of our insight into wild animals since our childhood ... back when there was no channel dedicated to national geographic or nature or animal planet.<br /><br />what always fascinates is just how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. watching the elephants trudge for days, nearly delirious from lack of water, is oh so painful. but their nighttime battle against the lions is thrilling.<br /><br />some of the underwater shots are breathless. the mama and baby humpbacks are beautiful and watching the great white shark attack its prey is every bit as chilling as "jaws". the most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the himalayas. i had never seen such detail of the vastness of the range.<br /><br />don't think most young kids today will be too excited by this one, but it surely is one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries i have ever seen.
