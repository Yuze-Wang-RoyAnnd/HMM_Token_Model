although cinderella isn't the obvious choice for a sequel i love jaq and gus so i didn't hesitate. the format of the mice writing a book for cinderella was an inspired one. i enjoy writing stories myself and hope children will be encouraged by this. the three stories are cute & amusing, although the songs were forgettable. jaq and gus were my favourite characters but i also enjoyed seeing lucifer, bruno, the mice chorus and all the rest. pom pom proved the perfect companion for lucifer and i liked the governess. a sequel done right for a change. my rating 8/10.
