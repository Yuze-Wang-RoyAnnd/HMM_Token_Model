how nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together. josie bissett and rob estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who marry in las vegas on a whim and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to meld their respective households (each has two boys and two girls)into a cohesive family unit. what transpires when the group, which includes four teenagers, two preteens and two younger children, makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for carrie and jim. the fights between the kids (and one little love affair between two of them) make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along. more interesting than the brady bunch, what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours. recommended as a feel good movie for all ages.
