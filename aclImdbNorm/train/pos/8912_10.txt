i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy. the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects. what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget, locally produced (valley forge pa) christian shorts. let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious. that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits. for what it was meant to be, this film is excellent. i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts, blair witch project was one of them, that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot. bwp was pure excrement. the blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted, and thoroughly entertaining. the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy. the scene in the doctor's office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece. bottom line is, i love this movie. i challenge anyone out there to take $120,000.00, inflated for today's dollar value, and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob. it just can't be done. period! <br /><br />thank you for taking time to read this review.
