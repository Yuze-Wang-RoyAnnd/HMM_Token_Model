with a simplistic story and an engaging heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all. john carpenter brings to life a nail-biting nightmare on halloween night, when laurie strode (jamie lee curtis in her debut, career defining role) and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun- only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell. <br /><br />michael myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum...having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now back in haddonfield, the sleepy illinois town where his murder took place. once he sets his eyes on laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived, he begins to stalk and terrorize her, turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her.<br /><br />beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary... with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you're being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself. myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion.<br /><br />although "halloween" is certainly outdated, it is by no means less chilling. the idea alone is goose bump inducing, and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day... it spawned seven sequels and eventually rob zombie's equally scary remake, and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today.
