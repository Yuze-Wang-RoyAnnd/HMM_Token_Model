this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen. the footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times. it also received an oscar for best photography, and deservedly so. i have many movies in my film collection and several more i've seen besides them, and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one.<br /><br />it's unique and an overall great movie. the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters. we follow their destinies with devotion, and get very emotionally attached to them. along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. i think much of this film for what it represent, and how it present it. i warmly recommend it
