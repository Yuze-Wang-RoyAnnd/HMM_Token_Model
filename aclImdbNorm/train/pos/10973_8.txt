excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies. they couldn't live together, nor apart. babbling constantly, sometimes at the same time, they hashed and re-hashed the past; going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda. i found myself laughing at times, but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were. see this one.
