i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grown-up. i loved the effect used at the end (and a little bit at the beginning) of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie. it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books. for example, the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books. i thought ned was perfectly cast, and emma roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of nancy drew. (just like the picture of betty crocker, she keeps up with the times!)
