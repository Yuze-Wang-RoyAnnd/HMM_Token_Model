what a fascinating film. even if it wasn't based on real life, forbidden lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element. and it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about compulsive liars.<br /><br />the author of forbidden love, norma, was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her name.<br /><br />but the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing. what a patient woman! i loved this movie. i have not read the book but simply heard good reviews and went to see it on boring rainy afternoon. the journey this film takes you on is clever, interesting and totally engrossing.
