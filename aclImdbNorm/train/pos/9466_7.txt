dan, the widowed father of three girls, has his own advice column that will probably go into syndication. after his wife's death, he has taken time to raise his daughters. having known no romance in quite some time, nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant marie, at a local book store in a rhode island small town on the ocean, where he has gone to celebrate thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. after liking marie at first sight, little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound. after all, she is the date of dan's brother, mitch.<br /><br />it is clear from the outset that dan and marie are made for one another, and although we sense what the outcome will be, we go for the fun ride that peter hedges, the director wants to give us. mr. hedges, an author and screenplay writer on his own, has given us two excellent novels, "what's eating gilber grapes", and "an ocean in iowa", and the delightful indie, "pieces of april, which he also directed. it's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during thanksgiving reunions.<br /><br />the best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars, steve carell and juliette binoche. mr. carell, in fact, keeps getting better all the time. in many ways, he remind us of jack lemmon, in his take of comedy and serious material. what can one say about ms. binoche, an intelligent actress, and a bright presence in any film. she proves she is right up to doing comedy, convincing us about her marie.<br /><br />the only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture. john mahoney, diane wiest, norbert leo butz, jessica hecht, emily blunt, allison pill, amy ryan, have nothing to do. they just serve as incidental music for decoration. dane cook, who is seen as brother mitch, fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others.<br /><br />"dan in real life" is a delightful film that will please everyone.
