two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets; a slimy south american drug-lord and a prominent general.<br /><br />moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere, sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller, taking it's time, establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences. director llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; some detours here don't add up to much. but this film is far better than his stallone/stone travesty the specialist.<br /><br />billy zane, usually incredibly tiresome, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced sniper teamed up with veteran berenger. as for berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget hollywood venture. he can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here, reprising the role twice more in direct to dvd sequels.
