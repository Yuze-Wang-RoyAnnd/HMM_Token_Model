nay sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love. this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny mathis's song, or any song from that era: bobby darin's, beyond the sea... or stan getz's, the girl from ipanema, et al...<br /><br />i measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i'm satisfied... chances are had me back a few good times.<br /><br />i also watch the synergy between the cast... i thought they worked well together.<br /><br />open your heart, and let the comedic magic of film transport you.<br /><br />'alan
