time and time again, i've stated that if people don't want remakes or sequels made, they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film. having said that though, the last time i saw an independent film myself must have been easily six months ago. so here's a review for an indie that i had my attention drawn to on youtube; the cure.<br /><br />right away, you can tell that the film is going for an avant-garde film approach which is telegraphed in its use of extreme close ups, scopophilia and fast editing. it is proud of the way it looks - and it has a right to be. for the most part it is a very nicely composed little piece, save for one inexcusable disregard for the 180 degree rule and a comically bad gunshot effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self funded projects.<br /><br />still, despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at. we're presented with a good use of props and locations, good visual acting and some very atmospheric, fluid editing, which is made more commendable as this is definitely something you won't see very often at all from a youtube submission. the plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening, but what we are seeing here is avant-garde storytelling at work; you can't really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of movie.<br /><br />where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound. what you're going to hear throughout is a distorted voice-over which often sounds insincere and worse still is the continuous background music, which goes through minimal change and doesn't add much to anything. so much attention is paid to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected, and this becomes really apparent when you realize you've just missed about four sentences of the narration and have to backtrack to pick up what slipped past your attention.<br /><br />so, give it a watch, but do it with the sound turned off.<br /><br />last thought; was anyone else reminded of the cover for doug naylor's red dwarf novel "last human" early in the film? if you have the book you know what i mean.
