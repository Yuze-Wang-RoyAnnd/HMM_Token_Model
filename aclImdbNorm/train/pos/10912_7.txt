"the ex-mrs. bradford" (1936), starring thin man series star william powell (this film was released the same year as the second thin man film, "after the thin man," comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the thin man films, but it nonetheless misses. still, it is a wonderfully fun, highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein.<br /><br />is myrna loy missed? of course, let's not lie. however, i'd be hard-pressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur. and the chemistry between arthur and co-star william powell is real and it's fun, romantic and involving.<br /><br />the story and screenplay by anthonyu vieller and john wyne's production company partner, james edward grant ("the angel & the bad man") is close to being up there with a thin man effort, but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle.<br /><br />while it's not in the stratosphere of 'the thin man" movies (what else is?), "the ex-mrs. bradford" is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery-comedy "who-done-its" of the '30s & 40s.
