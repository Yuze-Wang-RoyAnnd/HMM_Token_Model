i remember this game. it was always sitting on the shelves alone, until one day i decided to try something new for a change, and got this game. i stared in awe at it, since it was the first ever game for the ps1 that i owned that had 4 discs. when i played it, i couldn't put the controller down, seriously.<br /><br />the storyline of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as the final fantasy vii storyline, and that is hard to accomplish. when you play the game, you get so involved with the characters it's unbelievable that it's only a ps1 game, as it feels like a movie. and i believe it should be made into a movie.<br /><br />too bad this game is a very unheard of game and barely no one has played or liked it, as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves, with a 50% off sign sitting on it, trying to sell. well i am one of those people who always look at those on the ends, and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good. heck, that is how i got into final fantasy vii, looking in a catalog, and finding it. but this is different than final fantasy.<br /><br />legend of dragoon, is the only game or rpg that is better than most square enix games, surprisingly. i wouldn't be surprised if it was made by square enix but it's not. hardly any games i play are better than the final fantasy series, or the dragon quest series, but this one is. but what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised, which it should be.<br /><br />graphics are pretty good for a ps1 game, but what can you expect from it? it's ps1 man, made in 1999. story i have already mentioned is amazing, almost beats vii. characters are a amazing, you get involved so much with them, and their actions.<br /><br />a definite 10 out of 10. definitely deserved more praise, and a very well done rpg by a company other than square enix.
