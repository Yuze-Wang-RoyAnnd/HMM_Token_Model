this is an excellent stand-up dvd! eddie izzard is the funniest person i have seen in years. his routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it. i highly recommend this one. the part about the history of europe is a bit slow, but the ending jokes in french are quite good, because you don't have to speak french to get it (although if you do, it is still hilarious). also, the parts about being a transvestite are quite good. the first scene (about san francisco) is not great, but funny the first time. skip over those if you can. it's almost not worth watching. however, this really is a funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see.
