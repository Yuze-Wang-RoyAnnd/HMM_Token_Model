the cure is an amazing film...so suspenseful and just so real! i was lucky enough to catch a screening of 'the cure' at it's nyc premiere and it completely blew me away! i also heard it won an award from that particular festival, and it definitely deserved it. the first thing that struck out at me was the cinematography. eric giovon did an amazing job. the shooting style of the love scene halfway into the film was amazing. a love scene was necessary in this film, and jafri got the point across but also kept the scene tasteful. giovon and jafri make an excellent creative team and they should definitely work together on future projects. judy maier's narration was so surreal but simultaneously heart wrenching, it made me feel what the main character felt. i'm a very tough critic but i must say the cure is one of my favorite films..just love it! if you haven't seen it yet, check it out!
