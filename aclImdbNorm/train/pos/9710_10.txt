this is what makes me proud to be british. this is by far the funniest thing on tv. the league consists of jeremy dyson, steve pemberton, mark gatiss and the lovely reece shearsmith. totally underrated, this horror-comedy is perfection. the characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre, "hello dave". it is a comedy that everyone simply must watch.<br /><br />the best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh, and always pushing the boundaries. it does not need to rely on catchphrases(unlike little britain) for it to be funny. the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters, shows us that they've got balls of steel.
