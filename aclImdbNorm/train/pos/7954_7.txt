great voices, lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie. the addition of "character" to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning, particularly the relationship between the older fellow, shadow, and the young hellraiser, chance. the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive, which is done perfectly here. sally field is lovable in anything, but really shines in this film as the proud feline, sassy. great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life, and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent. there's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery. definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids. hats off to disney.
