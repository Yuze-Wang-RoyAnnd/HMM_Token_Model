walking home after the film, i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to. i've heard that before - where? ah, from kubrick's "eyes wide shut" (track 2), 'got it just as i arrived at the door. it's "waltz no. 2 from jazz suite no. 2" composed by dimitri shostakovich, performed here by the city of prague philharmonic orchestra. yes, i went and picked up the soundtrack from tower's. what a treat! the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz. it's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score. reminds me of favorite scores by maurice jarre, ennio morricone (beginning notes of track 6 have traces of "nuovo cinema paradiso"), georges delerue, and john barry. there are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings, celeste, piano, and harp. <br /><br />emily watson and john turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance. the love story, their intimate connection, is very much between alexandre and natalia - his childlike yet tormenting inner world, and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both. director marleen gorris of "antonia's line" (1996 academy award's best foreign language film from the netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without its unsettling human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family strives, lovingness and respect. the front-end subject is the mind-game and mathematical logic of chess. beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920's. cinematography captures the serene beauty of lake como in northern italy near the swiss border.<br /><br />i highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies. alexandre desplat's lyrical film score of "the luzhin defence" is complete.
