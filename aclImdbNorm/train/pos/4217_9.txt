it is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book. in this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure. to see the smug grin wiped off the face of abigail mitchell when she realises her victim has left "deathbed testimony" which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying.<br /><br />please understand: while i admire ruth gordon's performance, her character really, *really* irritates me. she is selfish and demanding. she gets her own way by putting on a simpering 'little girl' act which is embarrassing in a woman of her age. worse, she has now set herself up as judge, jury and executioner against her dead niece's husband.<br /><br />when columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an off-the-cuff speech to an audience of high-class ladies. he turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work.<br /><br />nothing can distract columbo from the pursuit of justice. abby's final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect not to do his job well. here is one situation you can't squirm out of ms mitchell!
