this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut. the plot is fairly thin. what drives the film is the characters, excellently played by mostly unknown actors. standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. the two actresses give natural performances and work well together. this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton. the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip. the film title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is a marvelous little comedy-drama.
