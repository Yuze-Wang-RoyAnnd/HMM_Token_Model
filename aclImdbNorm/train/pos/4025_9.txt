superb. i had initially thought that given amrita pritam's communist leanings and dr dwivedi's nationalist leanings film will be more frank than novel but when i read the novel i was surprised to find that it was reverse.<br /><br />kudos to marita pritam for not being pseudo-sec and to dr dwivedi to be objective. this movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way. casualty of any war are women as some poet said and this movie personifies it. it is also a sad commentary on hindu psyche as they can't stand up against kidnappers of their girls or the hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor. on the other hand it also shows economic angles behind partition or in fact why girls were kidnapped in the first place. i think kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls they will become legal owners of the houses and thus new govt. will not be able to ask them to return the houses. this apart one has to salute the courage of characters of puro and her bhabhi they are two simple village girls unmindful of outside world and risk everytihng by trying to come back after being dishonored . because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in india.<br /><br />no wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women.
