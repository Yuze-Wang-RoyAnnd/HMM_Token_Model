this is one of the most brilliant movies that i have seen in recent times. goes way above even any international movie of any repute. i am really surprised why this has not received the recognition it deserved. sonali kulkarni winning the national award is perhaps the only consoling fact. renuka daftardar simply amazes as she speaks volumes through her eyes. there are a few scenes that stand out: when gauri comes back from the city on krishna's wedding, she and krishna meet for the first time in many years. krishna notices a change in gauri, but not a single line of dialogue is said. the entire gamut of emotions is conveyed through subtle mannerisms and the eyes. there's another towards the end when krishna pleads to abhay kulkarni to marry gauri instead. if you are not moved by that scene, you don't have a heart.<br /><br />watch this movie for sheer movie-making brilliance and acting capabilities.
