hidden frontier is a fan made show, in the world of star trek. the story takes place after voyager has returned from the delta-quadrant . it has some characters from the official star trek shows, but most of them are original to the show. the show takes place on the star base deep space 12 and on several space ships, which gives it opportunities the official shows don't have. the characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy, which characters in shows with only one ship doesn't have. the show has good computer animation of spaceships, but the acting takes place in front of at green-screen and it gives a green glow around the actors. not all the actors are equally good, but most do fine. the episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes. that is a bit more like in babylon 5, than in most official star trek shows. hidden frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using. all in all i enjoyed watching it.
