when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the undisputed master and his final star wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). having recently seen revenge of the sith really puts this movie in perspective. the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what anakin skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor. it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for padm'e and the love she felt for her children. actually while the new films (especially episode ii) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. they make the old films seem even better.<br /><br />mark hamill does an exceptional job in this movie. he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real. in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. harrison ford is still good. however, you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. he adds more comedy (obviously inspired from raiders) to the character which works brilliantly. in short han solo is better than ever. carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very, very good.<br /><br />in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always lucas' fort'e so that is really to be expected. the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax. <br /><br />the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks. these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.<br /><br />all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. also george lucas' stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.<br /><br />8/10
