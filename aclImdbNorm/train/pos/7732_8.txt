the performances in this movie were fantastic. the dialogue was great. jason patric delivered a fantastic performance as "kid" collins in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel. far superior to "the grifters", which was a good movie, this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction/film noir roots from which the story came. i recommend this movie to all film noir fans.
