i thoroughly enjoyed this film overall, but four things really stand out: sam raimi's perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy(?)man, alan arkin's wonderful characterisation of the camp owner, and best of all, the cinematography. the beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer memories.<br /><br />the dialog and mood feel very natural and believable. some reviewers criticise the lack of a more "profound" script. to me, it is exactly that lack that makes this film work. the characters and their problems seem real and because of that, i care about what happens to them.<br /><br />the bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right.
