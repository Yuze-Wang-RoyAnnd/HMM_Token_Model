having enjoyed joyce's complex novel so keenly i was prepared to be disappointed by joseph strick's and fred haines's screenplay, given the fabulous complexity of the original text. however, the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone, naturalism, and levity of the book.<br /><br />it certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film. i imagine the latter would seem disjointed, with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together, without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot.<br /><br />it's amazing to see how "filthy" the film is, given that it was shot in dublin in 1967. the irish film censors only, finally, unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in ireland as late as 2000 (it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club, the irish film theatre, in the late 1970s). joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy, it offers many wildly "perverse" episodes. never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967.<br /><br />it is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the irish acting profession of the 1960s, respected players all, daring to utter and enact joyce's hugely transgressive text with such gusto.<br /><br />bravo!
