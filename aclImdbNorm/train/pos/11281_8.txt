this splendidly-directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm. it is a first-class adventure for many reasons, i suggest--fine photography, strong imaginative qualities, a delightful cast, good simulated-jungle locales and a very exciting storyline. johnny weissmuller plays tarzan, a mono-syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs' creation; but he is honest, loyal, brave and very courageous, and he needs to be during this narrative. as jane parker, his wife who had been jane porter in the novels, maureen o'sullivan is very attractive and lively, as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality. the effect of the lighting, the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual. this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back-lot which really works. the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed; but into their idyll come people searching from them, emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated. one is harry holt, still in love with her, who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him; the gown and perfumes interest her, but she refuses to leave tarzan. tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals, in scenes that look like a humanized king king. the group claim to want to hunt animals, and tarzan agrees for jane's sake to a bit of big game trapping; but at some point, the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition's heads' minds. tarzan is shot, left for dead; and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous "elephant's graveyard". but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions. tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call; in a most spectacular elephant-filled scene, he saves jane and what is left of the expedition, who return home little richer but much wise, as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband. the film was directed by set-design wizard cedric gibbons, and quite beautifully too. his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film,which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish. neil hamilton is a very good harry, paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad. forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally. an unusual and well-realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well. recommended.
