i first saw this when they showed this around easter time 1993/4 and didn't think much of it then, i bought this on dvd last summer when i started getting into michael jackson (i liked his music before) and enjoyed it more now i am older. it is a good film but it won't be this classic film like the sound of music, west side story, the wizard of oz etc. michael jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members. there were a disturbing scenes like the little girl katie getting slapped by the gangster frankie lideo who was played by joe pesci. the scene that frightened me when i was younger was when michael turns into a robot. my favourite song on the film was smooth criminal i think it was better than thriller in my opinion.
