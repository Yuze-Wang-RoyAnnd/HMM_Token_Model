for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments. in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film. the ending is superb. the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film it's ending wasn't an end but a beginning of the end. a great movie and only a piece of japan's great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind.
