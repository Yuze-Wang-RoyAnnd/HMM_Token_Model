full disclosure: i'm a cynic. i like my endings sad and my hankies dry. i didn't cry when bambi's mother was shot. will smith's new film happiness looks like a desperate plea for an oscar. basically i was born without an artistic soul. <br /><br />so why on earth did i like "10 items or less?" maybe it was the double espresso i downed before the show. or (more likely) maybe it was that even the most hardboiled of movie fans could use an occasional shot of sweetness. <br /><br />and sweet it is. from the moment "him" meets "scarlet" (an event far from a nora ephron "meet cute") the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed. (aided beautifully by phedon papamichael's cinema verity style camera work.)<br /><br />the main argument about the film is that it's too far fetched. is the film far fetched? i don't know. you tell me. i've yet to meet adrian brody at the market. (however, not for lack of trying). do i enjoy considering the adventures that might occur should this momentous event take place? darn straight i do . . .that's where most reviews of "10 items or less" fall short . . .they fail to take into account that even we cynics have fantasies. and heck, sometimes, it's worth the price of admission to vicariously live them, 82 minutes at a time.
