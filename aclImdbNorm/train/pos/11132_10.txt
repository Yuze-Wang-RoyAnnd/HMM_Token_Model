jon voight plays a man named joe. joe is shook up by a haunting childhood. he has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism. he quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people. he meets a misfit named ratso(dustin hoffman) and the two for a relationship. they go out and work together in helping each other out. they become thieves. the two grow remarkably close and soon can't live without each other. however, there is something very important that ratso hasn't told joe, and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together. this is one of the greatest films ever made. it is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other. their story is devastating to watch, but is ultimately important for people to see. it's one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street. the difference is that this film is from their perspective. their lives are shown to us and it's devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt, especially if we at one time were one of those people. however, the film doesn't try to guilt trip you. instead, it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling. it is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many hollywood films portray it such as milk money and pretty woman. the lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty, gritty, and ugly life and it's sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of joe in this film does. what startles me the most about this film was that it came out in 1969, and it has stood the test of time perfectly. today's audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969. the film was rated x, but what i notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest, realistic, and effective way. anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous, awkward, and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn't shy away from any of that. the sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be. movies that were x rated such as midnight cowboy, a clockwork orange, greetings, last tango in paris, and fritz the cat all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an r rating today. the sex scenes in midnight cowboy will seem quite strong but they certainly aren't sexy. they are not graphic, but they are realistic, and that's what people should keep in mind when they view this film. the course language that is used in the film, particularly the word "fag" is used effectively and is not gratuitous. the violence is very shocking to watch even today, but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler. i'm really glad to see that midnight cowboy is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in 1969, if not more. i can't recommend this classic enough and i do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten.<br /><br />pros: <br /><br />-jon voight and dustin hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch. they have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual. you'll forget who is playing them within minutes! <br /><br />-beautiful score <br /><br />-not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today <br /><br />-fantastic and fast editing job<br /><br />cons: <br /><br />-for mature audiences only <br /><br />-the opening scenes are well done, but they could be just a little stronger.
