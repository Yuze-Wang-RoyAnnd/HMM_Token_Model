this is just the best movie of all times! sorry, hollywood! i've seen it in early 70's, as soon as it appeared on the bulgarian tv, and i loved it immediately (i was 14 then). 25 years later i bought it on a video tape, and a few months ago it finally appeared on a dvd here in bulgaria. i live with this movie 35 years already, and so do all my friends and my family. my son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time, and he loved it immediately, too (and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding russian at all!). what makes this masterpiece of danelia so special? it's difficult to say, as it is difficult to describe what the beauty is... but the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time. i can't remember any other such movie, no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was... chapeau, maestro danelia! bulgaria loves you!
