daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor. he is brilliant as christy brown, a man who has cerebral palsy, who then learned to write and paint with his left foot. a well deserved oscar for him and brenda fricker who plays his loving mother. hugh o'conner is terrific as the younger christy brown and ray mcanally is great as the father. worth watching for the outstanding performances.
