i saw the movie recently during the boston film festival. the movie was very entertaining and is something that i believe the world, and black america is ready to see. it has comedy,drama, the soundtrack is great. it is an all around good film. the characters were well developed, and the movie had a wide variety of prominent actors, such as wood harris(remember the titains, paid in full), brian j. white (trois 3, mr 3000), and the wonderful zoe saldana(drumline, pirates of the caribbean). the movie tackles many relevant topics in todays society in a short period of time, and does so with class and grace. this is not only a story about life in the hospital, however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discovering who they are, or who they are going to be.
