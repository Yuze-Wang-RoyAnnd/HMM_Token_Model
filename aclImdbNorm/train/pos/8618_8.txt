pop quiz: you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history. what do you do? well, if you're a hollywood studio, you change the japanese g.i.s in g.i. samurai (aka timeslip) to the crew of an american aircraft carrier, have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie. but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country
