home room deals with a columbine-like high-school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial.<br /><br />*spoilers* the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer. the film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident, played by a very young erika christensen and busy philipps.<br /><br />the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues.<br /><br />erika christensen, though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting. busy philipps, three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me, blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence. this girl was the part.<br /><br />it's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. gus van sant's elephant (2003) though good, seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting. what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure - so much more a loss for an equally traumatized america.<br /><br />ten out of ten
