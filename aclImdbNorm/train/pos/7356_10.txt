if you haven't seen eva longoria from the tv show "desperate house wives" then you are missing out. eva is going to be one of the biggest latina stars and you'll be seeing her in the theaters soon. this was eva's first film and she does a fantastic job acting. she was 24 when she shot it, and looked hot then. as for this low budget film, it's pretty good for the first time director, who has another soon to be released movie "juarez, mexico" currently playing at many film festivals across the united states. in fact, it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news. what would be nice to see is a "snitch'2" with a higher budget.
