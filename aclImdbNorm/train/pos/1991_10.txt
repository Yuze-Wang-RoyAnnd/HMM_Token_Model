yes, as unbelievable as it may be, in 1968 a musical won the academy award for best picture - and it was the third musical to win that award in a five-year period, the first being my fair lady in 1964 and then the sound of music in 1965. the difference between my fair lady, the sound of music and oliver! however is that oliver! is immeasurably better! no comparison. the first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust oliver!. the acting is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dancing is great. this movie is dynamic, topical, relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown gangs of new york, oliver! offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century london, england that evokes sympathy without being condescending. oliver reed was a great actor and he proves it in oliver! the other actors and actresses, especially ron moody and shani wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
