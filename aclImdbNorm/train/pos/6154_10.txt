i was lucky enough to catch this film finally on turner classic films tonight, as it is one of the films that won an oscar (for special effects) in their yearly month of oscar winning films. <br /><br />bedknobs and broomsticks is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of mary poppins. that film too was a big success, and an oscar winner (best actress for julie andrews). like mary poppins bedknobs has david tomlinson in it, in a role wherein he learns about parenting. it is a fine mixture of live action and animation. it is set in a past period of british history (if not the edwardian - georgian world of 1912 london, it is england's coastline during the "dunkirk" summer of 1940). it even has old reginald owen in it, here as a general in the home guard, whereas formerly he was admiral boom in mary poppins. ironically it was owen's final role.<br /><br />the home guard sequences (not too many in the film) reminds one of the british series dad's army, dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war. the period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the blitz in london. and (in typical disney fashion) in the musical number "portobello road" different members of the british army (including soldiers from india and the caribbean (complete with metal drums yet!)) appear with scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume.<br /><br />all of which, surprisingly, is a plus. but the biggest plus is that for angela lansbury, her performance as eglantine price is finally it: her sole real musical film lead. in a noteworthy acting career, lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as auntie mame in the musical mame that came out shortly after bedknobs did. she had been in singing parts (in gaslight with her brief up in a balloon boys, and in the picture of dorian gray with little yellow bird, and - best of all - in support and in conclusion of the harvey girls with the final reprise of on the atchison, topeka, and the santa fe). but only here does she play the female lead. so when you hear her singing with david tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play mame dennis burnside.<br /><br />the rest of the cast is pretty good, tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure. the three children (cindy o'callaghan, roy snart, and ian weighill) actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their edwardian predecessors in poppins (weighill in particular, as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing lansbury after finding out she is a witch). the only surprising waste (possibly due to cutting of scenes) is roddy mcdowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film. with his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part. also of note is john ericson, as the german officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film, only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the british countryside, and sam jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that lansbury and tomlinson are seeking. <br /><br />as for the animation, the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon, and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view, with tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee, and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages. as i said it is a pretty fine sample of the disney studio's best work.
