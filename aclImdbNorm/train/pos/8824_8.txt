a woman, mujar (marta belengur) enters a restaurant one morning at &:35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant & is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film, which i only saw by finding it on the dvd of the director/writer's equally fascinating "timecrimes". it had a fairly catchy song & it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short. i'm glad that i stumbled across it (wasn't aware it would be an extra when i rented the dvd) and wouldn't hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my friends.<br /><br />my grade: a-
