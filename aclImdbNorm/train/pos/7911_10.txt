as a kid, i loved computer animation although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost nonexistent. this movie, as i sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost-hypnotic music, shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer. this is a whole-package deal, between the music and the video, that really packs a one-two punch. if you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation, this is a must have. <br /><br />i still, almost 20 years later, rate this movie as one of my top 3 favorites. the originality, i think, is still unsurpassed by most of today's mcmovies that hollywood spits out. i am currently wanting to see if i can re-make it on my own; if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this movie deserves a ton of imitation =)
