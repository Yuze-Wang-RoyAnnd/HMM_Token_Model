i vaugely recall seeing this when i was 3 years old, then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon. then i was about 8 or 9 years old when i rediscovered it and since i was then able to comprehend things better, i thought it was a good movie then. fast forward to just a few weeks ago (june 2006) when i re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles/video clips and it's just not the same movie. i'm sure it's still good with the kids, but to us 20-30 somethings it's definitely got "cult status" written all over it. it's a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be, but that's for fox to decide. i'm rambling here, i know. i still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great.
