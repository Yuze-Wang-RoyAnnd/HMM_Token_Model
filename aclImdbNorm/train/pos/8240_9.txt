i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto. this film was sort of a consolation when i thought i wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice. well, i was totally blown away. by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes, i actually forgot who was even in it.) terrific performances from the entire cast. carrie-anne moss was great in a true departure from her days as trinity. as for billy connolly, i think not since chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever. the kids were also great. definitely check this one out if you get the chance.<br /><br />and, by the way, i got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better.
