simply well written, directed and acted... woody's best of the 2000's if not his best since the 80's!! hugh jackman was the perfect pick for his roll. scarlett johansson's banter with woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become.<br /><br />it's refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady. he plays the perfect bumbling magician.<br /><br />there have been a few reviews maligning this movie. don't let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film. people in the crowd i saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line. if you like woody allen films of the 70's, you'll regret missing this one.<br /><br />i suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind, if you do, you might walk out smiling.
