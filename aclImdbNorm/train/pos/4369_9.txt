i loved this movie. the scenery was breathtaking, the plot had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. on two fronts, however, "rob roy" scored far above average. first, i have rarely seen a "popular" film in which the quality of dialogue was so high. there were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay. i could give numerous examples, but why should i? just watch the film. second, this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more. for a drama to succeed, it needs not only a hero, but a really believable villain. if you don't have one, there's not much joy in rooting for the good guys. and "rob roy" has not one, but three--the earl of montrose, his henchman kilairn, and archie. not one-dimensional villains, either, but fully fleshed and very nasty. it takes a bit more patience than "braveheart"--there's more dialogue, and the accents are a bit tough, but it's a much more clever and subtle piece. (as i said, i loved this movie!)
