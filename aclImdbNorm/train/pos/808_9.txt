i only wish that return of the jedi, have been directed by somebody else, i mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. besides this time our heroes look like different people: princess leia no longer fights with solo, luke looks boring, darth vader is not as evil as before, and yoda just dies.<br /><br />but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.<br /><br />some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence. 3-the emperor (now that's evil) 4- the speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-the last battle. 6-the dark side seduction scene. 7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force. 8- and the last celebration.<br /><br />some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. if some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.
