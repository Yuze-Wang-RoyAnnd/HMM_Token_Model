in 1978 a phenomenon began. the release of john carpenter's "halloween" got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is michael meyers. the critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated, and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history.<br /><br />plot: 15 years after a murder took place, four friends (all females) are babysitting(and having it on with their boyfriends) on halloween night. after escaping from a hospital the night before, michael myers returns to his home town to stalk these people. he murders 3 of them silently and subtlety. he does not speak. he walks slowly. he hides....<br /><br />only one of the friends escapes, after being saved by doctor loomis (michael's pursuer and doctor) <br /><br />there is one reason why halloween works so well. simplicity. we don't know where michael is, we don't know why he kills, and he frightens us. they're the only reasons why we are afraid.<br /><br />john carpenter wrote the movie, and directed. he builds unbearable tension throughout the story, and scares to such a degree, that sometimes we cannot watch. and the climax is truly startling.<br /><br />as horror, this is essential. it is terrifying and well acted. it is also mysterious. michael is a force, not a human. a force that cannot be denied.<br /><br />the sequels focused too much around michael and his "history". this movie focuses on the fear of the unknown. perhaps that's why this thing is a masterpiece.
