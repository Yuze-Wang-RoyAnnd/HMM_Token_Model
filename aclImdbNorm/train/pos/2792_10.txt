i love this movie. it is great film that combines english and indian cultures with feminist-type issues, such as girls wanting to play sports that were previously reserved for men. it shows the struggles of both an indian person wanting to break outside her cultural barriers and women wanting to break outside the gender restrictions found in sports, especially in england at the time. i feel that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues.<br /><br />in contrast to the other comment, i do not think this movie is anything like dirty dancing or any other such chick flick. this move is loved by many types of people, men and women, young and old alike.
