another spanish movie about the 1936 civil war. this time we're told about the story of carol (lovely played by d'ebutant clara lago), a little girl which comes to live to a little spanish village from new york. it is such an initiating trip, and soon she'll find about the injustices of the human race, their stupid fights and conflicts, their contradictions.<br /><br />imanol uribe makes his best film since "d'ias contados" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photography, and a nice script. he tries not to take part in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and let us decide (ok, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in) and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple: clara lago and juan jos'e ballesta.<br /><br />a well cared production.<br /><br />my rate: 7/10
