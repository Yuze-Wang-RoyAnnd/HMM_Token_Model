a good film with strong performances (especially the two leads). the film is about two american girls who are caught with 6 kilo's heroin on an airport in thailand. they're both thrown in prison and one of them signs a confession. bill pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out. all they have to do is find a nick parks who put the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls. so far for the story which isn't that original (it has many resemblances with the better return to paradise).<br /><br />the acting and newton thomas sigel's beautiful photography make this film worth to watch. a 7 out of 10.
