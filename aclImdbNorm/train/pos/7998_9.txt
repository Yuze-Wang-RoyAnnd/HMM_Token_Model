i loved this movie. i'm a mexican and was in the least offended by it. in fact, i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico. it's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. it angers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. we should have someone like creasy, denzel washington's character. a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's creasy did his fine job upon. that would be so marvelous (sorry, i am that resentful!). man on fire is a gripping film that you can't miss. it might be hard on some of you, if you aren't used to reading subtitles (mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies) but the effort will be well worth it. some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like traffic, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is). the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. i swear you'll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers. his performance is nothing short of excellent. the ending (no spoilers, ok!!!) is a bit sad, but i'm sure you'll like it anyway. man on fire is one of the year's best movies. a "must own" for a dvd collection! 9* out of 10
