the lion king 1 1/2 is a very cute story to go along with the lion king. it basically follows the original story of the lion king but with a couple of twists. in the movie,e vents are explained by a different characters point of view. this story is still an original plot.<br /><br />as far as sequels go, disney isn't all that great at making worthwhile ones. this one, being the third part to the lion king (simba's pride is the second.) actually has an original idea to it while still involving the fun of the first. timon and pumbaa travel along looking for the ideal place to live. after searching far and wide, they find the place of "hakuna matata". they then meet a small lion named simba, and go through many things that parents today go through.<br /><br />i think this is a very good movie, and i'm happy to add it to my collection.
