this is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called pecker because he use to peck at his food. pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of baltimore, md., and manages to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from new york city. pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over sugar and is actually an addict, taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag. there are scenes of men showing off the lumps in their jockey's with grinding movements and gals doing pretty much the same. it is rather hard to keep your mind out of the gutter with this film, but who cares, it is only a film to give you a few laughs at a simple picture made in 1998.
