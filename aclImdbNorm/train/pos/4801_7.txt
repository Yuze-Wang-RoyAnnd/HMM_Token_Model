i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv. i remember my father remarking that "this is how it could have happened - adam and eve." i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve, her eyes were blackened. i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry. having not seen this episode in 45 years, i still remember it vividly - the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet, scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters, with the final scene of the two walking off, adam carrying his pack and eve following. it may not have been a theatrical work of art, but it certainly left an impression on me all these years.
