just got through watching this version of "samhain", and even though i still like it, it's nothing like the "rough cut" version i have. if you check the message board, you'll see an apology from the director for this cut down version, 79 minutes., and he says he had nothing to do with this r-rated trimmed down edit with a completely new screwed up ending. christian really doesn't need to distant himself that much, because the basic gore elements still stand up, even though highly trimmed down. this is a damn shame, because this had the potential of being one of the goriest and best gore films in years. it still has the porn stars, and the inbreds, and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen. i'm just glad i have that "rough cut", because to me, it's a jewel for any gorehounds library. christian viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods, and hopefully his next project will be better produced. the idiots had a near classic in their hands, and screwed it up for everybody. "samhain" may be one of the most controversial and mishandled horror movies ever, and too bad gorehounds didn't get to see what the director intended.<br /><br />********************************************* just so you know what you missed, this is my review based upon the "work print" of samhain.<br /><br />the movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops. there is absolutely no music soundtrack, and some of the scenes have no audio on the dialog, because i think they are meant to be looped in later. however, most of the movie does have audio with sound affects, and when an effect or scene is missing, a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is completed. it's exactly as it says, a "rough cut", but the only uncut version of "samhain" you are ever likely to see. reason, because the gore is extremely graphic, much more than even an nc-17 would allow. yes there are a few porn stars, but they are just there for the killing, and to add a little sugar and spice. the story is pretty standard, american tourists on a vacation in ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods. an area that is heavy on folklore, involving the ancient druids and the celebration of samhain, or as we call it halloween. (spooky)<br /><br />the movie starts off with a huge dose of gore, as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. this is a great gore scene, as the guy find his girl hanging from a cliff, with her crying for help. all he sees is her head, arms, and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up, she has been completely sliced in two. this is what i would call extreme gore, with entrails, blood, and severed limbs all over the place. we are in herschell gordon lewis territory here folks, except the effects look much more realistic. i'm going to just skip the story, because it's your standard stalk and kill plot.<br /><br />the next gore scene is something to behold, as the boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like location (tcm-2 stuff), and bound to a table. this geek then cuts all of his limbs off (off camera, with a cue to insert a scene), and then we see his torso on a barbecue pit, turning slowly over a fire, and the torso has a hard-on (if you can believe that). yes, very bad taste, gross, gruesome, you find the right word, and it will probably fit too.<br /><br />then later jenna jameson, her beautiful body and all, is cut from neck to crotch, and all her entrails are pulled out in graphic glee, and her blood drains into a pot. yummy, a real turn on huh?<br /><br />but the best gore scene happens inside the house, and i have to admit, this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen. this guy (doesn't matter who) is caught from behind from a geek, and cut open at the ass hole. the geek then puts his hands in and rips out all the guys entrails, intestines, and what the hell ever else there is, right from his asshole. this goes on forever, as the guy is screaming and more and more innards are pulled out laying all over the bathroom floor. this is so extreme, so over the top, that i found myself laughing all to hell. obviously, you will never ever see this scene on a proper dvd, imo, along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes.<br /><br />so, what to think of all of this. well, first of all, even though i doubt this movie would ever be released in this totally uncut presentation, it makes this "rough cut" a rare jewel for gorehounds. yes, it's a little difficult at first, with no soundtrack, a few scenes to still be inserted, and credits that have missing names all over the place. but that's what makes this so unique, and i wouldn't trade it for anything right now. extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme gore. this makes "haute tension" look like a disney movie.
