a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, norman and paul, (brad pitt and craig sheffer) whose reverend father (tom skerritt) is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing, - and, for him and his sons, there is a fine line between the two. this story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths. it is a touching movie narrated by the director, robert redford, playing the elderly norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead.<br /><br />certain themes recur in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of paul. he is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has his fatal flaws.<br /><br />the closing lines sum up the "point" of the movie: "then in the arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big blackfoot river and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. the river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. on some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. i am haunted by waters."
