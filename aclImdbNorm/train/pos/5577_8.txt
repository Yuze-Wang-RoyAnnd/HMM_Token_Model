i hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time. the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall! this one was definetely fresh and witty. if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings, only a few women have voted! i don't want to ruin the movie for you but i'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score, why? because the movie puts men in their place, that's why. if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men...it could easily be a "7" rated movie!
