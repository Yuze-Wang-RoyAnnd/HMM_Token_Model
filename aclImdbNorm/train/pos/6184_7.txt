since this is black history month and i'm reviewing the achievements of many african-americans on film in chronological order, i got this movie on vhs from the library because duke ellington and his orchestra were in it. their jazz version of franz liszt's "rhapsody" was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mystery-musical comedy mixture. many other numbers i liked were kitty carlisle's especially "sweet marijuana", carl brisson's "cocktails for two" as well as his duet with carlisle on that earlier, and the ones by gertrude michael who's great as the woman you love to hate. jack oakie and victor mclaglen probably go a little too long with their love/hate banter as the producer and detective but they grow on you. and toby wing is a sexy dumb tease as nancy who keeps trying to say something to oakie but gets a "not now" from him every time. while many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen, i wasn't surprised by the revelation of who done it. and get a load of how naked the women here are (though of course their breasts are covered, either by their hands or some flimsy top). this was very obviously pre-code. worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing. p.s. as a long-time louisiana resident, i like noting when someone was born here as carlisle was a new orleans native.
