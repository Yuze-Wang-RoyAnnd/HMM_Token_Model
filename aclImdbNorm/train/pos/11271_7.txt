tarzan and his mate(1934) was the only tarzan movie i didn't see when i was a kid. it sounded boring. now i have seen it. i have seen the ape man(1932) about a hundred times and i keep a copy on my drive. it's a remarkable movie. it's almost flawless. tarzan and his mate(1934) however, falters. it's not harmonic and it's parts tend to live a life of there own. the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great. big budget expensive. tarzan himself is co-starring. jane dominates. she have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy i tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead. well. she let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant. she insists tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father. forever. the thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle. stupid? later someone founds it in the river. well it's supposed to proof tarzan is dead. some cheap drama. the crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone. she takes their words for granted and want to be taken away(to england). stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is, how hard he is to kill. the caravan is leaving and jane go along. again a pothole. she could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more, to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband. she could be smart. she could dive where they found the floating bracelet, check the banks for traces. she can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in liana's. picking up traces shouldn't be too hard for jungle jane. she could talk to the apes, and so on. if she get home to england without have done this she would become miserable. jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down. and why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with "i blame myself as much as you". a punishment for being vane perhaps? nonsense. struggle, a hard slap and telling tarzan would be appropriate. still. this movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep. just lean back and enjoy. it's tarzan and jane for god sake.
