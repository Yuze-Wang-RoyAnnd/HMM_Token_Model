i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy. brosnan is genius; as anyone will now testify, he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role. kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role. i don't know if i've laughed as hard during any movie! what an unexpected pleasure! my favourite line would be 'i feel like a bangkok hooker on a sunday after the navy left town'. brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse. i was also very impressed with hope davis's performance. it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy. if you liked the dark and hilarious 'the weather man', you will definitely like this. <br /><br />i voted 10.
