i am a huge john denver fan. i have a large collection of his music on vinyl. i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it. i have the original vinyl album and cd. i have the original cd and later release. the later release is missing several songs though. i see that it has been released this year with all original songs. to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at $75.00. wow - to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much. to me no amount is worth selling this treasure. it is my favorite christmas cd. i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd. i would love to have either version. if anyone has one available please let me know. thanks
