most people (36) gave this movie a 10 and those who don't are being too critical or maybe expected something else. this is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, it grows on you, and has it all. i just got it on dvd and 20 years later it still does not disappoint, having plenty of action, drama, romance, and even comedy. add to that the great car chases, automatic weapon shootouts and lots of stuff blowing up and you have a fun, edge of your seat experience! you will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this. <br /><br />you can watch this movie with your wife/gf and you will both enjoy it lots. the premise is that of a paperback book hero, like doc. savage, really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here. the actor jake speed is also a director, producer and writer of many films. in this film jake speed (the character) is an indiana jones adventurer type, he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations but will sometimes resorts to brute firepower (yay!,and sheer dumb luck too!). keep an eye out for his one "james bond" hi-tech equipment, the ultimate road warrior suv dropping out of the sky.<br /><br />the heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early jim carey vampire movie "once bitten" and here she is a little older and still a knockout even compared to her teenage blonde little sister.<br /><br />the bad guys are "real bad" men and are the worst lowlife villainous scum you love to hate. the ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel, sadly never made - but you can just imagine what would happen next!<br /><br />you have to see this movie just because it will entertain and amuse you and that's worth the price of a ticket.
