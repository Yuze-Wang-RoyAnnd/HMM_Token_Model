this movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no "good plot" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time. porn is watched for the porn, jackie chan is watched for the action, i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. sure the middle of the movie was boring, very boring, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that. this did change the way how american action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie. if you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan's, hes pure in everyway. he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park, and even in todays movies. american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more. police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece
