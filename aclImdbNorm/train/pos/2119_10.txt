"the shop around the corner" is one of the great films from director ernst lubitsch. in addition to the talents of james stewart and margaret sullavan, it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and felix bressart .they're the type of character actors that hollywood sadly no longer employs. in fact, the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood doesn't make anymore. (the makers of "you've got mail" claim their film to be a remake, but that's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise.) anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's, you'll find "the shop around the corner" to be nothing short of wonderful. just as good with repeat viewings. enjoy!
