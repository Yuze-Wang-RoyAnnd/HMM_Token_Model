the jist: see something else.<br /><br />this film was highly rated by gene siskel, but after watching it i can't figure out why. the film is definitely original and different. it even has interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy "noir" feel. but it just isn't entertaining. it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense, in plot but especially in character motivations. i don't know anyone that behaves like these characters do.<br /><br />this is a difficult movie to take on -- i suggest you don't accept the challenge.
