i never heard of the book, nor care to read it, but the movie i will probably see many times.<br /><br />this film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest imagery i have ever seen in a movie. it was as if i was looking at paintings many times, which i think was the idea.<br /><br />terrific movie, story, actors, and cinematography. full of profound emotions from every angle. although i am not particularly fond of romance movies, i loved this and was deeply moved by winona ryder's plea to her father toward the end.<br /><br />mr. irons deserved an award for his performance and close was never better.<br /><br />
