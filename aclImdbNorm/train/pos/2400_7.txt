i do see what my forebears saw in the youthful bette davis. she's splendid throughout this almost-madcap political comedy which actually stars warren williams as the political operative constantly behind on his alimony. vivienne osborne is brilliant as his ex, and i found myself rooting for her throughout. the williams character is not at all sympathetic, and he's not even a decent op.<br /><br />guy kibbee is one of the best at what he does. as a candidate dragged out of his sleep at a political convention and nominated to be governor in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated, so this whole mess is borne of internecine political warfare in a party called the "progressive party." if you're of a political mind, you will probably see a party other than the one with which you are affiliated reflected in the fictional "progressive party" of williams and kibbee. i could draw exact parallels, but we're not here for that.<br /><br />this is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. if you've ever watched any of the old wheeler & woolsey titles (half shot at sunrise, the rainmakers), you'll find frank mchugh, as williams's right arm, looking and behaving a lot like bert wheeler. he had me fooled.<br /><br />yes, both my wife and i recommend this one.
