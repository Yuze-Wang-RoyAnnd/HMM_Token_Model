kurt russell's chameleon-like performance, coupled with john carpenter's flawless filmmaking, makes this one, without a doubt, one of the finest boob-tube bios ever aired. it holds up, too: the emotional foundation is strong enough that it'll never age; carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and ultimate poignancy of the life of the one and only king of rock and roll. (i'd been a borderline elvis fan most of my life, but it wasn't until i saw this mind-blowingly moving movie that i looked beyond the image at the man himself. it was quite a revelation.) elvis remains one of the top ten made-for-tv movies of all time.
