this was one of the first creepy movies i ever saw...i was about 5 at the time. it scared me good! but that night i put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster...and my mom got very upset. she had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like double mint! now that's a movie! hey for it's time it was a great movie. that head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then. and if your 5 it is very scary! kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing for your minds imagination. your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects!
