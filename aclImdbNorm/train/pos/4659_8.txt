without peter ustinov and maggie smith, this could easily have been a turkey. but they are brilliant. ustinov is at his best, and for fans of maggie, it is great to see her in her early days, matching ustinov every step of the way for with and timing. for englishmen in their fifties (and i am in that bracket), it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear sounds of the swinging sixties, and although this film spends a lot of time in offices, it has plenty of sixties nostalgia, including red buses, carnaby street, a song by lulu and a delicious shot up the micro-skirt of a waitress, the like of which england has never seen since in public places. as an i.t. engineer, i know that the computer hacking tricks are laughable, but they are not meant to be taken seriously. nor are the wonderful stereotypes of italians, french and germans.
