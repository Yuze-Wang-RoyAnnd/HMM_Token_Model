this is one of the first independent movies i've ever seen. for such a very low budget, it was done well; as an insomniac myself, i can sympathize with the main character, although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing. <br /><br />well directed, well acted, of a subject that i haven't seen much in theaters, lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting. there are few noticeable goofs, but they may be intended; you'll see after you watch the movie. the movie is very personal, and worth watching twice. no movie is flawless, but a hollywood version couldn't do the story better. all in all, 8/10.
