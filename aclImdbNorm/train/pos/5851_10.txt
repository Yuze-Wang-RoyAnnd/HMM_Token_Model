*spoilers*<br /><br />this is only the second pay-per-view i've given a perfect 10, the first being the 1991 royal rumble. it was full of exciting matches that weren't memorable, just disposable fun. and that's why i love it.<br /><br />the opening match between razor and dibiase, as well as ludvig borga vs. marty jannetty were the only low points. they were ok matches, but dibiase deserved better in his final pay per view match. these days, a match like this would have run-ins and a bigger climax for razor's first major babyface push. and jannetty, fresh off a intercontinental title run, could have had a better match with borga. but i don't think anyone really cared. they just needed a borga push on pay per view television.<br /><br />irs and the kid were great, as were michaels and perfect. i wish perfect could have won, but michaels lies down for no one. notice how right after this, he left the wwf so he wouldn't have to job to razor. bret hart had two great brawls with doink (notice how everyone's best match is against the hit-man) and then lawler. their rivalry was a classic; that's why that year's feud of the year was a no-brainer. how often do you see two legends win feud of the year this late in their careers?<br /><br />the steiners-heavenly bodies match was one of the best of the year. who knew the bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams ever?<br /><br />many say that the undertaker-giant gonzalez match was a waste of time. but i loved it. remember, what made the old wwf (as in, pre-wwe) great was the mix of athleticism and freak show. is there a soul out there who didn't like akeem?<br /><br />the main event wasn't bad, although nowhere near match of the year status. they put lex luger over well, but made a wise choice in having yokozuna keep the belt. he was the first heel since superstar graham to hold the belt for more than two months. nowadays, heels are champions all the time. but from the beginning of the wwwf through the wwf of the 90s, if you blinked, you missed a heel title reign.<br /><br />as an old school wrestling fan, this one and summerslam '88 are my favorites.
