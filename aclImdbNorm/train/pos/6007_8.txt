if you have not heard of this film from walt disney pictures, do not worry about it. it would be classed along the other films by disney that are meant for educational purposes like "family planning".<br /><br />it was co-produced with kotex to teach pre-teen girls about menstruation, supposably. it only educates at a superficial level, so it does not go into heavy detail for the animated "ram's head"/ reproductive system sequence.<br /><br />the film does show "the wonderful world of disney" elements like the turning of the page and the use of animation to tell the story.<br /><br />this film is impossible to find, so if you can find the film, best luck to you and enjoy.
