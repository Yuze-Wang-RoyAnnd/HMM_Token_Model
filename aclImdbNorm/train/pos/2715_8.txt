q.e.d. was a brilliant tv series and it truly was one of the very few worth scheduling for! i suspect that in this era of tivo and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982. i am eagerly awaiting its availability on dvd!<br /><br />while it is true that it has some in common with other television shows like the wild, wild west, the bearcats and the adventures of brisco county, jr., all of which i am a huge fan of,q.e.d. had a much more intellectual quality to it. it did not suffer for that, however - the dialog was witty and the action was high. the show ran in the uk as mastermind, and it did have something of the bbc feel to it, but with better production values than bbc typically had in that era.<br /><br />i was a nineteen year old lad when this series ran initially, and had much too much to do in my life to make time for television. i remember my dear mother, however, calling me to remind me that q.e.d. was on, and we would sit on the phone and watch it together. wonderful memories.<br /><br />truly, q.e.d. is a sad loss and, if it could be done with the same quality and values today, i would love to see it make a return.
