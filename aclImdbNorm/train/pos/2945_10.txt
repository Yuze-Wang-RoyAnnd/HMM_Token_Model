i watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly split my sides laughing each time. i love eddie murphy as an actor, but this stand up is some thing else. he is so funny. even the p.c. brigade would find this hilarious. it's a must watch, and even better if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink. the take off of michael jackson is so like him, if you close your eyes you believe it's him singing. the things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny. my local video stores do not stock this video any more but i would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour. anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy.
