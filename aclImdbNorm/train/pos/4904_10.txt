charming in every way, this film is perfect if you're in the mood to feel good. if you love jazz music, it is a must see. if you enjoy seeing loveable characters that make you smile, can bring a tear to your eye and swing like there's no tomorrow this film is for you. if you are looking for an intense, deep, heavy piece of art to be dissected and analyzed perhaps you best stick with something by darren aronofsky (in other words - reviewer djjohn lighten up, don't you know a good time when you see one!) my only complaint is that the movie was just too darn short. i guess i'll just have to watch it several more times to get my fill.
