this is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s. it was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances. pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something. john cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't mind his louuu-siana accent. he may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect. the way that pacino's character interacted with cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical at times. danny aiello was superb as always. david paymer was great in a supporting role. bridget fonda was good but not memorable. there were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many. it may take a second viewing to remember, "which zapatti was which?" after so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap. the ending didn't have a lot of sting. it was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown. this was one of the few problems with the film. since the movie wasn't billed as a "huge, blockbuster" big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie even existed. pacino and aiello were great but the film's lack of "splash" in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations. it was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learning that this title is out there. made in 1996, it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come.<br /><br />so, make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!
