i was pretty young when this came out in the us, but i recorded it from tv and watched it over and over again until i had the whole thing memorized. to this day i still catch myself quoting it. the show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters, from frank sinatra, to sylvester stallone, to mr. t. the voices were great, and sounded just like the characters they were portraying. the puppets were also well done, although a little creepy. i was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by rob grant and doug naylor of red dwarf, a show that i also enjoy very much. like another person had written in a comment earlier, i too was robbed of this great show by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. i sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a dvd release, but i don't think enough people have heard of it. oh well, maybe i'll try e-bay...
