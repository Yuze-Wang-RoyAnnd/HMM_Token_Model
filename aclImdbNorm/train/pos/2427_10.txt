this is really a great unknown movie.perfect dialogue without the typical clich'es.this movie relied on the actor's talent and it was pulled off.it even had a little bit a comedy in it,but it wasn't overdone.once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be,not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in.i especially loved the interracial aspects of it all.<br /><br />now onto the actors themselves. laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal.it's a shame that he's only allowed to show his talent in his own movie. titus welliver was fabulous as fishburne's junky half-brother. eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film. paul calderon was perfect as a grease monkey/drug lord.i loved his acting since "king of new york". but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan,who were paired perfectly as two of calderon's henchmen.<br /><br />once in the life is for sure a keeper. ****1/2* out of *****.
