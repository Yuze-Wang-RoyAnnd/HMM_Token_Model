ok, i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie. i can't recall ever watching one. i also don't recall watching a jimmy fallon movie. alright, i did watch taxi, but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake. but, this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing. i don't know what it is about her, but i just smile the whole time i am watch her. she just captivates me that way. i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in 50 first dates. how sad is that? this wasn't the greatest baseball movie - it wasn't supposed to be. it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for. it had a predictable ending, but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile.
