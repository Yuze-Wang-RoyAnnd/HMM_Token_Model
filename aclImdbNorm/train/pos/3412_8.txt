docteur petiot, starring michel serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. a doctor who heals the sick in occupied france, even if their ability to compensate is not there. yet, he preys on the weakest amidst the populace. the imagery and cinematography are superb, and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story. he is the perfect psychopath. seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. a movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer. kudos to mr. serrault, for his chilling portrayal.
