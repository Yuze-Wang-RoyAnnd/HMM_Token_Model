admittedly, i know nothing about baseball, i'm not even a fan of the sport, but that didn't stop me enjoying the farrelly brothers' latest film, fever pitch, a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy. the film is not really about baseball; rather, it's really about relationships, and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place.<br /><br />jimmy fallen
