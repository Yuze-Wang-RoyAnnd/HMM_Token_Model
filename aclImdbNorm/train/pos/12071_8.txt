nicolas roeg's projects are variable to say the least, but are never less than interesting. "insignificance" is obviously, first and foremost, an adapted stageplay: it's wordy and pretty-much 'room-bound'. but, it pays to view this film more than once: the underlying themes are not overtly presented and, what's more, it takes a while to adjust to the juxtaposition and role-reversals of the four protagonists: einstein, mccarthy, munroe, and dimaggio. <br /><br />einstein is wracked by guilt over hiroshima yet fancies the simplicity of a sexual liaison with munro; munro is sick of being seen as a bimbo and craves intellectual credence; senator mccarthy is at the height of his witch-hunting powers but is an impotent sleazebag; dimaggio is insecure about his celebrity, self-obsessed, and prone to violence. each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction. each character has a troubled, abused/abusive past and a questionable future. gradually, we see that obsession itself is the central theme. america's obsession with its postwar cultural icons and mores; the obsessions of the protagonists for something none can have: peace-of-mind and/or happiness.<br /><br />compared with the theory of relativity, a proposed unified-field theory and, indeed, the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of roeg's protagonists seem insignificant. yet these aspects of the physical universe (it's all quantum, trust me!) affect us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us. monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron-bomb (without naming it as such) is not an anachronism per se, but can only be understood by a contemporary audience. indeed, all the references within the script are only accessible to a knowledgeable viewer: one au fait with '50s occurrences/personality cults and how they affect us in the 21st century.<br /><br />this film and its screenplay are either very, very clever, or extremely opaque and pretentious. ultimately, however, probably insignificant.<br /><br />live long and prosper :) <br /><br />
