and anyone who watches this film will agree. this film was directed in the days when plot, character believability and theme actually mattered.<br /><br />jean peters, widmark, and thelma ritter steal the spotlight. ritter is in top form as informer "moe" she survives in the bowery section of ny, acting as a stool pigeon for nyc police.<br /><br />the only other film in which i have seen peters is "niagara", and she certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with brooklyn accent. widmark is appropriately menacing, as the anti-hero who must discern what the right thing is, despite his need for cash.<br /><br />the photography is brilliant. the neon, the subway station (though it looks cleaner than the real thing!) the harbor shack where widmark lives as a transient. excellent use is made of the city, with "lightning louie" in chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop. 10/10.
