cassandra peterson originally created elvira as the television hostess of late-night horror films, and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on the tonight show with johnny carson. she reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s, and the film elvira, mistress of the dark was the result.<br /><br />the plot is flyweight. television horror film hostess elvira dreams of success in las vegas. when her great aunt dies, she travels to new england in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show; she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house, a poodle, and an old book. it happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description, and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes. it also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on "the old book." throw in a few teenagers, a stud muffin, and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go.<br /><br />no one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece, and it does drag now and then. but cassandra peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish: squirmy, sexy, and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy, she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self-mocking jokes. from a flashdance disaster to witchcraft craziness, she is never less than wildly entertaining. it's a tremendous amount of fun, and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense. will elvira best her evil uncle and save the day? well, i don't want to give anything away, so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun finding out.<br /><br />dvd quality is okay and there's little in the way of bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge. and if you've never seen tassle-twirling, you're in for a treat. recommended.<br /><br />gft, amazon reviewer
