i read somewhere (in a fairly panning review) that this is something of a live-action mecha anime, and i think they're on the right lines. i first watched this movie when i was very young and i've been dying to see it again, and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back. i don't think this is to be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of good old 80's almost-a-tv-movie fun (it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future, although this point isn't stressed too much). what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didn't sound generic - no clich'es, no predictable lines - all in all just good fun! maybe time hasn't been kind to this little movie, but still i can find appreciation for it in me. it's by no means perfect, but it's entertaining and doesn't try to be anything other than that. let the nerds and comic-store-guys worry about technicalities - who cares? see it for yourself and make your own decision. no-one else's opinion matters.
