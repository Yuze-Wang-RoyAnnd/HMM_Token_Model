this film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would, for adults. the idea of a child's drawings becoming a place she can physically visit and have influence over is wonderful. at the same time you could get all child psychologist about it and say she's really exploring her subconscious, just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. the bit that gives me goose-pimples is when her dad is in the paper house, and chases her. the only thing i can't stand is that it was marketed as a horror film...it really isn't. if you want to see something british with plenty of storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have to use, then watch paperhouse.
