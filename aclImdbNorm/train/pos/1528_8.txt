i'm a writer working at home and diagnosis murder is my lunchtime break companion - good, clean fun, good humour and nostalgia for the days of the dick van dyke show. how innocent we all were (and how innocent is diagnosis murder). i particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like joe mannix. the bad guys always get caught, the good guys carry on. the stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously.<br /><br />one beef: why were so many of the villains women or at least bitches? amanda was too dizzy. its hard to imagine her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an autopsy.<br /><br />i hope we haven't seen the last of dick van dyke and family on our screens, esp. at lunchtimes!!
