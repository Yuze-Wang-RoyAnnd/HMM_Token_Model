well, would firstly like to clarify that kaakha kaakha is a part of a tamil prayer and roughly translated it means "to protect". khakhee on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform (which is khakhi!).<br /><br />also, the tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial ventures , any rajnikanth or vijay movie would stand testament to that statement.<br /><br />now kaakha kaakha is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack. certainly very stunning in the final scene, especially love the ending (which is certainly unexpected!). the gore is rather too much at times, but certainly this is a great movie!
