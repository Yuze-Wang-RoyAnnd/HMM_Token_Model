whilst it is universally acknowledged that fearful symmetry was heavily influenced by the kolchak episode they have been, they are, they will be, whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point. as a huge fan of both series i subscribe to the latter belief, although the less charitable may not do. james whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster, but he pulls it off with style, the teaser being an absolute gem. lance guest does a great job of making a credible character out of kyle lang and jack rader seethes with menace as ed meecham. forget fearful symmetry's dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying x file.
