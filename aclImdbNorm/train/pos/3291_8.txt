a great film this, and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel four.<br /><br />the plot is a simple one but works very effectively, the blurring between child-like fantasy and hard-hitting nightmare is very well blurred. the budget looks pretty low, but to the credit of those involved it doesn't show too often. it also hasn't dated that much either.<br /><br />i was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago, and it has withstood half-a-dozen viewings. it's one of those films that won't appeal to all; though as usual, those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this.<br /><br />charlotte buerke puts in a good performance as anna, the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene. cross is also very good, carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture.<br /><br />there are some genuinely (and i don't say that lightly) disturbing moments in this film, both half-second shockers and more drawn-out tensions. watch it with the lights out!<br /><br />highly recommended.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />
