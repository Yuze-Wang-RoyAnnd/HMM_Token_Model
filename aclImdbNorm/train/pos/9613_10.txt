it is hard to describe bug in words, it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood. it follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything i have seen lately in a hollywood release. as its characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is merely an observer. the almost proustian narrative flow of thought to thought, the very spontaneity in the script will have you glued to the screen, waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end. and as far as the thematic elements...there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to bright and beautiful, and then to tragic, all within the span of about a minute. and it works.<br /><br />this movie is pure magic. it reminds one why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has. perhaps with more movies of bug's quality, people will start to take notice.
