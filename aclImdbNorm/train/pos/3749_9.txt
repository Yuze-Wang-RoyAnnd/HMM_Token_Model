i laughed a lot while watching this. it's an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness. the characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization. the dialog is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully. there's max, who has apparently led a horrible life. and there's edward, who isn't sure what life he wants to lead. my favorite character was tom, edward's insane boss. tom has a short role but a memorable one. highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor. and you can find it online now, which is a bonus! i am a fan of all of jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what he comes out with next.
