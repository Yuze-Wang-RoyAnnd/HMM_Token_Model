i thought the movie was fairly well done for a made for tv movie, and it contained both a lot of action and humor. i found the entertainment value worth watching, and would watch it again or a similar show again. i'm disappointed that sean was not credited here on imdb.<br /><br />i can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with sean once again playing for even higher "cash" stakes, since his life would be on the line again anyway.<br /><br />i felt that sean played the role very well, and reminds me of an actor by the name of matthew ashford who plays jack deveraux on days of our lives - the soap opera.
