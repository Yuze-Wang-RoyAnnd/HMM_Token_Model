i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles. however, i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film. the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes. a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features. i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias, discrimination and sanctimonious pretence. an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen.
