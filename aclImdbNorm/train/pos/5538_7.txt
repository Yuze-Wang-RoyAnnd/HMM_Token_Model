a couple(janet and richard) go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp. after camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house. soon, a pair of escaped convicts show up and, after much delaying of the inevitable, they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a birdcage.<br /><br />this last house on the left-like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made. it's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers. moreover, i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it's perverse tone. i love caged terror. the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty. i found the film to be quite creepy.<br /><br />the flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film, which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering. while i didn't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question, i do think that it will both most people. the acting isn't too good nor is the dialogue, at least in the early scenes. this film takes a little more patience than usual, and it's really not for everyone.<br /><br />in short, this was a good film. not the greatest horror film i've ever seen, but it is certainly a lot of fun. it's not exactly the easiest film to find. it's possible to find it in the used section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough. it's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of trash cinema then it's definitely worth checking out.
