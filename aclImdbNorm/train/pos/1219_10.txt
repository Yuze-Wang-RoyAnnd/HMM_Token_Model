the second care bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor. it has a deeper plot, better character development, and the tunes (especially the closing song) are both catchy and warm-hearted. sure the movie tends to over stress caring but come on, it is a care bears movie. this movie is a great picture to show to kids because it emphasizes friendship, love, and again, caring. not to mention the care bears are just too adorable!
