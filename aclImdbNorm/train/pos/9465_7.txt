steve carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure. by judging on the plot and cover art of the movie i was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but i guess i was wrong. sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light drama to me and steve carell once again gave a great performance. the movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element i found. but, the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable. through-out, the cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important. though, it came down to old, flat and predictable ending. i'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie (perhaps for the bad, even) this movie would get better publicity. still a fun movie.
