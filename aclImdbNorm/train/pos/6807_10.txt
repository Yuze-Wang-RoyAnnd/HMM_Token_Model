i have copies of both these movies the classic where robert blake is a mighty fine actor where most of the 1967 movie blake is more shown standing by a window in jail telling his childhood life where it makes since why he killed the clutter family doesn't show much in the classic of what really went on an doesn't tell us which one really done the killing but it's a great eye catcher really if you watch the 1996 movie in cold blood the classic makes a lot more sence .
