wow! i have seen so many bad low budget films lately, but this one is great. the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series. i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent clich'e about the police. this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time. a perfect tradeoff!
