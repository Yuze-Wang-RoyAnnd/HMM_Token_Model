i liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage. it is very clean you can see it with family. very nicely done. songs are ok too. i think the writer director is great. the movie shows how marriages progress thru time. they have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story. some of the dialogs are quite good. the movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization. also shows perfect is after all not so perfect. shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. the movie is very well written and directed.
