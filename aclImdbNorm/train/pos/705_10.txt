i came across an insomniac's nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films, and glad to say it did not disappoint. this crazy half hour ride had me wondering all the way through, and the ending was excellent - one of those nooooo moments that really stays with you. i've shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree hands down. the little ghostie girl was very talented and i think her performance stole the show. she creeped the heck out of me, i can say that much. nanavati did a great job putting this short together. all the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she's a great writer from what she did with this script. so well written. it's undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. the directing was great and the acting was enjoyable, but the most important factor here is the strength of the screenplay. good job to this girl, i can't wait to see more!
