as a comic book reader, who still sees myself as a total kid at heart, i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie. i mean, there hasn't been a good superhero movie out for quite some time (note: batman forever was not a good superhero movie). i really wanted this film to be good, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read blair witch project) i wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />mystery men was definitely not a high-effects, tension-filled action flick, it was a comedy. and on that basis, it was a success. it had everyone in the small theater laughing, and got applause and laughs right through the final scene. stiller and garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness. william h. macy plays a great straight man, while kel mitchell and the fart-powered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy.<br /><br />though the sets are bizarre (and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it is still just plain funny. there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off-guard, and bring tears from the belly-laughers among us.<br /><br />i definitely recommend this movie. although not an all-time classic, it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread. the writing is good, and the cast is great. if you're worried, plan on the matinee and pay less, but either way you'll be pleasantly surprised. i mean, who among us doesn't root for the losers once in a while?
