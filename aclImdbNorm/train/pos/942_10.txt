this is the best film version of dicken's classic tale. i've seen it over and over on vhs, and recently acquired the dvd version, which is formatted for tv (not wide-screen). what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films/shows in north america since 1984. my biggest surprise is edward woodward, "the equalizer", as the ghost of christmas present.
