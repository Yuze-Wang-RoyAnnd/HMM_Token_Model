iq is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest-thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as cupid's helpers. the juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light-hearted yet thoughtful movie. you don't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love, but at other times, you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space/time of our age. the end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout. walter matthau is a perfect einstein, meg ryan creates a quirky, scatter-brained mathematician, and tim robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science. all together, they create a farcical trip through love and science, mind and heart.
