fascinating yet unsettling look at edith bouvier beale (big edie) and her daughter (little edie) aunt and first cousin to the late jacquelyn kennedy onasis. they live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. it becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. little edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. the content is pretty much made up of two things. the first are the conversations were little edie lambastes big edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. these discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. the second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by. their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. for without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. most amazing line comes from big edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.
