i'm 14 years old and i love this cartoon. burt reynolds and dom deluise make a great pair. this movie is really funny and i love the songs. my favorite songs are "you can't keep a good dog down" and that song about sharing, i think it's called "what's mine is yours". this was the last movie with judith barsi, who played the voice of anne-marie. my favorite character is charlie but i find itchy's voice is so fun to hear. although some scenes i actually found scary, i still have a hard time watching the scene with charlie's dream, and carface scares the crap out of me. other characters like king gator i found really funny. the ending was adorable and was actually sad, made me cry a little. i give this movie 7/10.
