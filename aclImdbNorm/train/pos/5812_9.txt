moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you're not a michael jackson fan. i'm a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film, the ending wasn't fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were - if you're a fan.<br /><br />i personally believe the first 50 minutes are re-watchable many times over. the dancing in each video is breathtaking, the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining.<br /><br />it includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos. it also includes some live concert footage.<br /><br />if you're a big fan of michael jackson this is a must, if you're not a fan/don't like michael jackson, steer well clear.<br /><br />9/10
