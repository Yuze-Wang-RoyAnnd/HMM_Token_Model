for the attention of chuck davis and emefy: i saw phantom lady many years ago, when i was not yet a jazz buff. there is an exhibition going until end of june in paris's brand new musee du quai branly, named le siecle du jazz, not to be missed, with as a special entertainment nine excerpts from jazz movies, including phantom lady's famous drums sequence. i've seen gene krupa - and elisha cook jr - in almost all their film appearances, and i can confirm the following: 1.elisha cook jr was dubbed in the movie. that was some progress, since in most of his other appearances he was killed (mainly in howard hawks's the big sleep). 2. krupa probably dubbed cook in pl. i could recognize his style, since he had already graduated from the tom-tom used (and abused) at the beginning of his career - namely in 1937's hollywood hotel's sing, sing, sing sequence - and eventually got everything that was possible from what we call in french "la caisse claire". 3. the sequence from pl, at least as shown in the museum,is not censored.harry carasso, paris, france
