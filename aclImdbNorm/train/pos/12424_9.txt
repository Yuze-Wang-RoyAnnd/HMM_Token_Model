i'd always wanted david duchovney to go into the movie business, and finally he did, and he made me proud. this movie lived up to what i had hoped for. duchovney played his character very well, managing to remain consistent with something new, instead of playing the agent molder we are used to. therefore, i give him extra credit for his role, also because i could not see anyone else playing that particular character. david was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic timothy hutton. a brilliant performance that you don't get tired of throughout the movie, because he never fails to surprise you. he has weaknesses, and strengths, making the story all the more believable. i also very much enjoyed the narration, it added to the story a good deal, and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time. this movie also had a wounderfull score. i recomend this for anyone who likes drama, and doesn't mind blood.
