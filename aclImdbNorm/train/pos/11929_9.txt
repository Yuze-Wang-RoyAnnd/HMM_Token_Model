one piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business.<br /><br />at the time, in 1994, this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history (and may continue to hold). it was held in pittsburgh, pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the original film's "angels" who "haunted" the pittsburgh pirates. in this remake they "haunt" the california angels.<br /><br />anyway, the premiere was held at the long gone three rivers stadium which was the home of the pittsburgh pirates and the pittsburgh steelers at the time (the pirates are now housed in pnc park and the steelers at heinz field). the premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held (and may even continue to hold) the record for the largest movie premiere in history, shown to 60,000 fans. danny glover, tony danza and christopher lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans.
