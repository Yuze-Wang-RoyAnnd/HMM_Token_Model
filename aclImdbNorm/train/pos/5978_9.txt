this is a true "80's movie": back then they made maybe 100 times more movies than nowadays, and that makes many of them quite interesting... it was a cultural phenomenon, that don't exist anymore. nowadays maybe the same kind of people that would have made cheap "straight-to-video"-movies in the eighties, are doing cheap porn. porn seems to sell. anyway, this is above the medium trash-movie level: it has good&fascinating story, and it's quite well made i think. in one scene you can even see the microphone swinging on the upper edge of the picture. of course there are also little cameos by ozzy and gene simmons, but they don't very much contribute to the film "success", although they are good in their small roles. the monster,heavy-singer "sammi curr", looks really terrible, especially when he's singing. one of the scariest monsters i've seen in horror flicks. i may have nightmares of him next night. not recommended for intellectual movie lovers.
