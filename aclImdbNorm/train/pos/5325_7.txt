the idea of making a film about the beatles sounds doomed idea, as no production can catch the idea of the actual historic beatles. then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past, but to produce an illustration that works best with the other available beatles material. this is exactly what 'birth of the beatles' offers to us, the simple story known to us without any extravaganza.<br /><br />*** spoilers here on *** <br /><br />be warned that not everything is that accurate as some beatles-graduates might expect. the beatles are seen performing songs that hardly were even composed by that time. the beatles perform "ask me why", "p.s. i love you" and even "don't bother me". the beatles-graduates should see that if the beatles on the film only performed songs that they actually did at hamburg, the younger viewers might not anymore recognize the beatles they have learned to know them. of that original hamburg repertoire only "johnny b. goode" and stu sutcliffe's "love me tender" are retained.<br /><br />the guys who play the beatles in this production scarcely look like the originals, but the rest of the film still make good viewing as the film is for the rest fairly accurate. the guy who plays lennon does it good and the rest of the band are not bad either. brian epstein is great and the moment when he sacks pete best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film. also as a bonus you get to see the original cavern club in the film.
