wow i loved this movie! it is about normal life in a small village. about hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. great! it is about things everybody encounters in life. you have to do things with passion. but some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. there are people who find the opinion of others and 'what will the neighbors think' more important than to follow their heart. don't let anybody's opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. i loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it could have been my family. no big beauties, but all people you fall in love with during the movie.
