i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of "show people". i cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters, plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words. seeing the cameo, out-of-character appearances of so many m-g-m silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself. i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie, patricia pepoire. make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees marion davies but it is something to the effect of "i don't think i like her!" pop the corn, pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history. enjoy!
