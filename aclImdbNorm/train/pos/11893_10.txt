the subsequent two seasons of this original series was less than lacklustre. the latter seasons disastrous reshuffle contributed to its three season short life span. maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season it would've gained a cult following.<br /><br />aside from that, the first season was truly hilarious! witty, clever with superb writing it was promising. the first season's excellent brew had the right ingredients - characters/actors, storyline and so forth. plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to boot. nora and her fellow "photographers" on the prowl, night after night, day after day for the exclusives.<br /><br />a lot of things don't make sense to me. like how this show, and another fav of mine - gross pointe never "made it". if only the first seasons of the naked truth, and grosse pointe were released on dvd, please anyone out there?!
