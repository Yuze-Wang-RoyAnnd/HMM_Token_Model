the more i watch nicholas cage, the more i appreciate him as an actor. watching this movie now (in 2005), i can see that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s. i don't really think it can be considered a film noir, but it is pretty dark at times, due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters.<br /><br />typical performances from each of the three main actors, who all did a good job with their roles. i thought, however, that hopper and boyle's characters were left undeveloped, as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy. the plot is really good, and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic, there were parts where i had to hand it to the director (i.e. when he first sees the sheriff). all in all, this movie is definitely worth watching. ***1/2
