it has only been a week since i saw my first john waters film (female trouble), and i wasn't sure what to expect the second time around.<br /><br />while the previous film was outrageously over the top, pecker is actually a funny film that satirizes the art critics in new york to a t. anyone who cannot imagine what these "experts" find so appealing about modern art, will enjoy seeing these pretentious snobs get so full of themselves over pecker, a boy who just found a broken camera and starts shooting his friends and neighbors.<br /><br />edward furlong (pet sematary ii, terminator 2: judgment day) was surprisingly good as pecker. there wasn't a lot of meat on any of the roles in this film, but he really shines.<br /><br />christina ricci (prozac nation) comes in with another great performance as pecker's girlfriend. in fact, it was a banner year for ricci (buffalo '66, the opposite of sex, and pecker.<br /><br />lili taylor, who had the only good role in the haunting, was also a significant part of the film and really made it enjoyable.<br /><br />there are many funny scenes, but i have to say the best was when a crown gathers screaming, "we want bush!" "we want bush!" "we want bush!" i thought it was a republican convention until i saw the police hauling off the dancer.<br /><br />i am going to have to look for more of waters' work, especially hairspray, now that that is in the news.
