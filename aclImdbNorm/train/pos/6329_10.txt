the cult movie for every true russian intellectual. everything is brilliant, especially acting: it's beyond any praise. the movie, as the book, is full of symbols: my favorite one is the brightest symbol of razrukha (colloquial russian word for "devastation", often signifies the period of lifestyle chaos after the 1918-20 civil war) -- the wide-opened dirty door in the bricky wall squeaking in the snowy wind and the pitch-black hole of the doorway behind it.<br /><br />now the film is released on dvd with fully restored image and the 5.1 sound, there are well-translated english subtitles too, though some obscene words of sharikov were replaced by the more mild versions in the translation. i don't know is that dvd available abroad but if you'll find it grab it immediately, it's really worthy of watching.<br /><br />and, in conclusion, a fact: about the 50% of russians today, mostly youth, can be identified as sharikovs in a considerable degree. it's the post-soviet effect: soviet people appeared to be wholly unprepared for the informational attack of the western civilization, tv-producers and movie makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive, soulless and thoughtless so that it abetted the darkest instincts of every russian. even among the internet users every third one uses the obscene language in forums and chats because it's amazingly common in colloquial speech.
