a powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the smash broadway play about the lives of bessie and sadie delany, two "colored" sisters who lived past the age of 100. wonderfully played in their old age by ruby dee and diahann carroll, respectively, they tell their story in flashbacks to amy hill hearth (played by amy madigan), a white new york times reporter. the flashback and present-day scenes don't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book, but really are powerful. however, certain aspects of the sisters' lives, such as the inter-racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their father's stern personality are not presented clearly. you need to read the book to fully understand these things. which is just as well, because the book's just as great! aside from those flaws, it's wonderfully done and performed, especially by dee and carroll, and a very powerful and educational movie.
