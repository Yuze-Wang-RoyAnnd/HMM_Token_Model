the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing, that is what i guess makes him so mean. i don't think most men will like this movie, especially if they ever cheated on their wife. this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end. but then, there you have it, a candy-bar ending that makes me look back and say, "hokie as hell." a pretty good movie until the end. ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning. and then there is the aftermath of what happened. guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending. i'm left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end.
