from the mind of robert bloch, of "psycho" fame, come four tales of twisty terror in this amicus anthology film, which, while not quite as much fun, or scary, as i would have liked, still provides for some decent genre entertainment.<br /><br />it's linked by the wrap-around story of a highly skeptical scotland yard detective (john bennett) who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor; he's advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place, and our film is off and running.<br /><br />"method for murder" has author charles hillyer (always delightful denholm elliott) haunted by his latest fictional creation, who has seemingly come to life. this sequence has some good surreal and fairly suspenseful moments, and is capped by a reasonably amusing revelation and denouement.<br /><br />"waxworks" stars horror icon peter cushing as retired stockbroker philip grayson, who, along with old friend neville rogers (joss ackland) becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum. most effective in this episode is the dream sequence, although it's great as always to watch cushing. the final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking.<br /><br />"sweets to the sweet" features another well-loved horror star, christopher lee, as john reid, who doesn't treat adorable moppet child jane (chloe franks) with too much kindness, and it's up to new companion / tutor ann norton (nyree dawn porter) to find out why. the mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently; the film-makers wisely don't tip their hand so it comes as more of a genuine shock as we get the full truth of this unhappy family. the "dying" moments are particularly horrific.<br /><br />"the cloak" has the most outright comedy of the four; jon pertwee, one of many actors to have played the role of dr. who over the years, is a lot of fun as a vain, temperamental horror movie star (in fact, he's the highlight of this story) who, infuriated with the lack of quality in his latest low-budget film, goes out and buys his own cloak. said cloak has strange powers, which i dare not reveal here. sexy ingrid pitt is a welcome presence as pertwees' companion; one wonderful example of the humor here is a knowing jab taken at none other than christopher lee!<br /><br />the wrap-up story then concludes in a predictable but still effective way as detective inspector holloway learns that he should have taken all of the warnings given him more seriously.<br /><br />underscored by michael dress's unusual, striking, and eerie score, "the house that dripped blood" is an entertaining mix of stories; while i don't enjoy it quite as much as, say, "tales from the crypt", it's still good fun. capably directed by peter duffell, it moves slowly but surely towards each of its chilling conclusions, and is certainly a good film of its type.<br /><br />7/10
