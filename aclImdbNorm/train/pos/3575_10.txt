both robert duvall and glenn close played their roles with such believability, i simply cried. glenn close's role as ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. "let him think about what he did," robert duvall's character, joe, said staunchly. the story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called "the stone boy," meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. then towards the end when jason presson's character, arnold, let it all out to a stranger, i was so broken hearted for him, that i actually thought of some of the terrible things that i did in my life. i personalized and identified with his character. frederick forrest's and gail youngs' roles, did not add not much to the film. i thought of frederick forrest, who played ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. his wife, lou, played by gail youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. i could not really feel sorry for these two. though lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. both did not deal with their problems effectively. they really did nothing for the film and were totally ridiculous. wilfred brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, touching for he was the only character that showed arnold any attention. i felt his role should have been elaborated. the players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient. however, i really liked the ending so much, i actually smiled and cried tears of joy. i felt good. the hillermans were a family again. i actually wanted to be a part of this family. they were so realistic.
