*** spoilers*<br /><br />my dad had taped this movie for me when i was 3. by age 5, i had watched it over 400 times. i just watched it and watched it. and i still do today! it has a grim storyline, a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf--a very emotional scene--and wants to become a wolf, like him. after years of training, the lamb is made into a really really evil looking thing. he and the wolf travel to his old barn, but he cannot kill the lambs, no matter how much he wishes to. he ends up killing the wolf, but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends, and can't return to his previous way of life.<br /><br />the art is beautiful, the songs are..well, okay, and the voice acting is better than some things today.<br /><br />all in all, you just *have* to see this movie, it is a great masterpiece. although, it's very hard to find today.<br /><br />
