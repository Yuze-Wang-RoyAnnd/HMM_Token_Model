the title says it all.<br /><br />i'm not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie.<br /><br />obviously this movie didn't have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great! it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie! i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd.<br /><br />i'll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films! <br /><br />dylan o'leary, cast and crew, i thank you!
