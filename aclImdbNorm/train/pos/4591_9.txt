it's depressing to see where jackie chan has ended up. he used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts. to be fair, he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown. but with 'rush hour 3', where he takes a back seat to chris tucker (of all people!), and then there's 'kung fu panda' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue... to say that jackie chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement.<br /><br />it's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old vhs tape and watch jackie kick some arses in his younger, fitter, chris tucker-free days.<br /><br />enter 'police story'. jackie chan plays kar-kui, a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial. he faces resistance from both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both.<br /><br />but on the other hand, who cares? we don't watch jackie chan films for the story. we watch them to see jackie chan perform eye-popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is.<br /><br />and on that level, 'police story' doesn't disappoint at all. there is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in jackie sliding down a giant, high-voltage chandelier. seriously, if this sort of thing happened more often, no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes.<br /><br />there is also comedy, much of which involves kar-kui inadvertently upsetting may (maggie cheung), his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend. the humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle, but it works so i'm not complaining.<br /><br />the acting isn't too subtle, either. indeed, i'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'police story' at all. director jackie chan (yeah, he does that too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and knows that while we're waiting for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning.<br /><br />so 'police story' is a blast. as is the case with most of his films, the fact that jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition. i mean, when jackie chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella, a whole new "wow!" factor is added to the action.
