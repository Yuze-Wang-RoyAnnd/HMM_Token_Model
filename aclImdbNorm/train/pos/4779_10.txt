on paper, this movie would sound incredibly boring. the idea of a 75-year-old man traveling the country-side on a riding mower certainly doesn't have much appeal to it, but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence. writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than "the straight story."<br /><br />the perfect example of this is a scene in which alvin meets a runaway teenage girl. she's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. alvin tells her a story about his own kids, long ago. he had them each take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them. "that bundle," he said, "is family." so many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger. "the straight story" realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions.<br /><br />alvin's journey across iowa is full of such refreshingly un-hollywood character interactions. each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to wisconsin to make peace with his brother, lyle, who has suffered a stroke. and the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey. it's a journey in which alvin shares his life with everyone he meets--to their benefit and ours. it's a slow, simple, relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we've lost with the urbanization of america.<br /><br />"the straight story" is the rare live-action "g"-rated movie that truly should not be missed. grade: a
