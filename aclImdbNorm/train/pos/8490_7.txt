i recently saw this movie in my international business class. i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary (not to say i don't love documentary i've just hard bad luck with movies in that class) imagine my surprise when this movie, that's actually a movie, came up. <br /><br />this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere. the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call. i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh, because yes it is funny. <br /><br />well, that's about it! cheers
