one would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film (and i've seen hundreds of hindi and bollywood movies, too). the actors, the beautiful settings, locations, and surroundings, the deep emotions portrayed, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of udit narayan, my favorite) -- everything was just lovely. the human (imperfect) element was also woven in, to create some drama and drive the plot, as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution. alok nath is such a terrific actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost steals the show from the young stars. i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances -- ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love -- as one of the best films out there, hindi or otherwise!
