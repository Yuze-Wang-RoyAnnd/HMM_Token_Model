i feel like i have some uber-rare disease that no one has heard of and i have finally come across a support group on the net! i finally found this title by asking for an answer on an "experts" site on the web. i too, saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending. i have never forgotten it and have never seen it since. no one i know saw the film and i had almost given up on ever finding it's title. alas, even knowing the name, i shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially. small steps...<br /><br />g
