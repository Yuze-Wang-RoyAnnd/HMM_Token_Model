engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river. they are pacifist ed (jon voight), adventurous, violent lewis (burt reynolds), obnoxious bobby (ned beatty) and nice guy drew (ronny cox). the first 40 minute are great--there's the incredible dueling banjos sequence, interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by vilmos zsigmond. then two hillbillies attack ed and bobby. one of them rapes bobby...and the trip becomes a nightmare.<br /><br />just unbelievable. the scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place. to be truthful, beatty's rape has never bothered me--i'm very aware it's being faked despite the good acting. this movie also shows how the characters change--ed has his pacifism tested, lewis becomes weak, bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and drew tries to keep himself sane. direction by john boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely.<br /><br />the acting is mostly good. voight is just ok in the lead--he's been better. beatty is also just ok--but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role. cox is very good especially when things start falling apart. and reynolds is just superb--one of his best acting jobs ever! how this wasn't even nominated for an academy award escapes me. also bill mckinney and herbert coward are way too believable as the hillbillies.<br /><br />a powerful film--not for children. try to see an uncut version--the tv version is butchered. also letter-boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images.
