i am curious of what rifle beckett was using in the movie, and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing. if this is loosely based on carlos hathcock's sniping, i am guessing that it is a 7mm. round. i am also curious of the rifle itself. he also made a comment in the final sniper movie about the rifle that the vietnamese man let him use that belonged to his father. beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. i would like to know which rifle that is also. i know that this particular rifle was made around wwii or beforehand. i just couldn't get a close enough look at it watching the movie to identify it.<br /><br />as for mr. hathcocks kills, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills. after his wounds somewhat healed from being burned in vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the usmc the skills that they would need in the field. his sniping career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters that train in the usmc. i found out his name from my friend who is a former marine. any information would be great.
