my daughter gets really put out at me when i refer to drew barrymore as looking as if she'd been hit in the face with a frying pan, not to mention her dudley dooright chin that jay leno would die for. how wonderful, then, when i discovered in "fever pitch" that i really like miss barrymore; and jimmy fallon; and the red sox; and boston! this film is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy. to be absolutely stereotypical, the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and jimmy fallon's vulnerability, and the boys will like it for all the male bonding and the depiction of sports mania.<br /><br />my sports-hating wife, my teenage daughter, and i all found something to like in the film. that says something in itself. it's a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half or so, and is probably a really good date flic, too.
