as with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters. but whilst c + j eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood, this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism. most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet, despite their deeply un-pc behaviour, everyone emerges smiling. like c + g, through it all they remain innocents at heart, rebels against the quotidien, the bourgeois, the restrictive. as someone else has commented, i wouldn't want to know these 2 and it's a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy (and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door) and thus for that reason, it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth. dare i say that only the french can get away with films like this. and that is part of their genius.
