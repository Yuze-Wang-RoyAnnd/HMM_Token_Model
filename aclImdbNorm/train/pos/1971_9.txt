i have no idea what people are complaining about. i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it. stone once again delivered a great character. she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct. she still has those smart but tricky answers. although sharon may be 48 years old... she looks amazing! i don't care if she's as fake as a barbie. she looks good and that's that. basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. sex, violence, and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it. so don't listen to them.
