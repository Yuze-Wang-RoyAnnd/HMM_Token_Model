if you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s (in l.a.) then you've missed a special treat. this is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today's world in which we live in. it covers everything from raising a child, prejudice (more than one way),love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc..and the list goes on. this story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life. it helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life. makes us ask questions of ourselves. have we done enough for others, are we like this, etc.??? sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that i'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime.<br /><br />take note of mary mcdonnell, kevin kline and danny glover's wonderful performance through this whole film. these actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us. these are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now. i still enjoy it again and again. also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and don't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it's symbolism for the movie??hmmm... i almost forgot this is probably steve martin's very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done. he, too does an excellent job in this movie. this may come as a surprise to most of you. sit back, relax and enjoy truly good film making.....
