the bourne ultimatum (2007) review: after a thrilling set of two, we get the final installment. here's my take:<br /><br />the bourne ultimatum has it all. we have jason bourne(matt damon) on the coattails of the ones who know everything. he has been running for too long. this time, it ends.<br /><br />the bourne ultimatum has a great plot, awesome writing, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best action of the summer. matt damon delivers possibly his best performance to date. he has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin.<br /><br />there are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense. the reactions to certain events will have you either laughing(in a good way) or cheering on. (or both) i heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping. the audience was loving it.<br /><br />the bourne ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package. all of the goods and then some. this is, in my opinion the best movie this summer.<br /><br />the last word: excellent conclusion. the best of the trilogy. this is how summer movie thrillers should be done. i love the bourne trilogy.
