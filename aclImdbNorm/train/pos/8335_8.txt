while the sparkling chemistry between ryan and robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie, the supporting cast (including matthau, fry, shalub, durning and the hilarious trio of jacobi, saks and maher) is an additional plus. matthau shines as einstein, fry is perfect as ryan's clinical fianc'e, and shalub's line about einstein's gonads is, as has been noted, one of the highlights of the film. the speech that robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is sheer poetry. kudos to the writers for handling this froth with wit and levity. i also thought that keene curtis was wonderful as eisenhower. this might be considered something of a chick movie, but i think everyone will get a kick out of it. eight very solid points.
