tenchu aka. hitokiri- directed by hideo gosha - starring shintaro katsu and tetsuya nakadei belongs (together with goyokin, hara kiri & rebellion) to the best chambara movies existing.<br /><br />its the story about shintaro katsu (who plays okada izo) working for nakadei, who wants to become the daymio. okada, being the "cleaner" for nakadei is being treated like a dog - and after quite a while he realises - what he realy is to nakadei.<br /><br />but there is so much more in this movie - every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!!<br /><br />(tenchu means heavens punishment)
