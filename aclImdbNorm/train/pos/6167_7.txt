"such a long journey" is a well crafted film, a good shoot, and a showcase for some good performances. however, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of jack of all plots and master of none. also, western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. recommended for those with an interest in india.
