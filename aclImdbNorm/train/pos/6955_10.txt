my super x-girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride. the special effects were excellent and the costumes uma thurman wore were hubba buba. uma thurman is an underrated comedic actress but she proved everyone wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend. she was just simply fabulous!!! luke wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. the supporting cast was also superb especially anna faris who was extremely good (a lot better than in the scary movie franchise).<br /><br />ivan rietman did very well in directing this film because if it wasn't for him and uma thurman this film wouldn't have done so well. this film is clearly a 10/10 for it's cast (uma thurman), it's director, it's screenplay and from it's original plot line. this film is very highly recommended.
