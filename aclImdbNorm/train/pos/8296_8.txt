everything is idyllic in suburbia when the little family moves in, as the father have got a new job in a computer company there. but no paradise would be complete without its snake. strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband, as it certainly holds secrets. the father is not a joiner, but pressure is on him to join, as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members. robert urich's good guy part is a bit tepid, but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles. suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy susan lucci as club chairperson. look out for cult favorite michael berryman in a bit part as a valet. the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for. i have seen this movie quite a few times.
