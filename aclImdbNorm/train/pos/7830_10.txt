in "die nibelungen: siegfried", siegfried was betrayed. now, kriemhild seeks revenge. she marries hagen, and through a series of events, finally engages in a very drastic (but fitting) action at the end.<br /><br />one of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals. attila the hun (called etzel in the movie) is shown as the strange person from the east, possibly an allusion to the soviet union. obviously, it was not fritz lang's fault that hitler used "the nibelungenlied" for german national pride in the third reich, but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story. nonetheless, this is an absolutely formidable movie.
