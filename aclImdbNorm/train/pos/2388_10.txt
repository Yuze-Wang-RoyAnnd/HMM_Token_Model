i love the doodlebops. my son has been watching them for over a year. we went to the doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday (connecticut). he loves them. the doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares? are you being serious? the tv isn't suppose to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet. the parents should. get over it. the doodlebops actually can sing. deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do not lip sing. imagine, they dance, jump around and still sing. they have talent, the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show. this show is by far the best show on tv for kids. and a rock band for children. how amazing is that? why are people saying chad (rooney) is gay? where did you hear that from? whether he is or not, he is awesome! leave him alone. its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children!
