sure this was a remake of a 70's film, but it had the suspense and action of a current film, say breakdown. he's running, desperate to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are the least concern. the chases were very good, the part with him being<br /><br />cornered at a rest stop was well done, the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger. this is better than bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car chase that was filmed badly? vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law, few movies had the effects-night vision, cb radio-okay i forgot the name of the movie, guy has 76'caddy souped up, toys with guy he upset. the ending is great, you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not, a very good did-he-make-it-or-not.
