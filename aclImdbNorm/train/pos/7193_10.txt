god! zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as tarzan, and probably had about as many actors in the title role. <br /><br />this serial is one of my own personal favourites, and as previously stated,it is one of the top 5 sound serials. oddly enough, this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939.* by the time of this production in '39, zorro was really well known as a (pulp) literary and movie character. the film opens up with a little foot note about the history of the mexico's struggle for freedom from rule by a european monarchy, namely spain. the story invites comparison with the american revolutionary war.<br /><br />the story concentrates its attention to the mythical province of san mendelito and its 'council'. it is being addressed by benito juarez**on their gold mine's relation to the new republic of mexico. gold shipments must get thru to mexico city.<br /><br />don francisco uncle to diego vega, states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoys.a thug from the don del oro mob, stages an 'insult' to himself and challenges don francisco to a duel with swords, don frasncisco getting run through.<br /><br />suddenly the dark clad masked swordsman appears to sword fight and after carving the trademark 'z' on the face of the bad guy, he dispatches him to the hereafter. don francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward ramon (william corson) that zorro is his nephew from the city of los angeles. he also attempts to tell of the true identity of don del oro, but expires before completing statement.<br /><br />there is a big reception for diego at don francisco's hacienda, where diego disappoints ramon'sister (also ward of don francisco) with his timid act. "a fop!!", she declares.<br /><br />later,diego and ramon slip away to join up with a meeting of the volunteers. when they ask, "who will lead us with don francisco now dead?", ramon declares "zorro, we are zorro's fighting legion!" well there is a big battle with the legion, now all clad on gray, with masks and capes, protecting the gold train. then zorro seems trapped at a man-made avalanche intended for the convoy, when, well, you know cliffhanger end of chapter one.<br /><br />wow! that was a lot of writing for one chapter, but like most other serials, the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line. let's just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good, well made, action filled chapters following.<br /><br />zorro's fighting legion has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action. we have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting trouble between different groups. there is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of 'don del oro'. we had soldiers, renegade whites, hostile indians and the legion.<br /><br />in short, it's safe to say that there is everything one could want, and then some, in this serial. and, incidentally, they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any mexican accents.<br /><br />as to just what is there here that makes zfl stand out from the rest? what makes it different or unique? well........<br /><br />first of all, it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on the screen. the opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the cantina in chapter one. this is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in serial sound track.<br /><br />and yet there is one more feature that really sets the fighting legion saga out in front from all others. that is, the film not only has a heroic musical theme, but it also sports lyrics, yes, the legionairres sing! we hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters! it really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewing.<br /><br />when the serial was first shown on our local television (circa 1955), all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of reed hadley as belonging to 'captain braddock from racket squad, the tv series. mr. hadley had a very distinctive, deep voice.*** he also handled the role very well. his costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functional.<br /><br />there is a small slip up. a sort of minor anachronism occurs by having benito juarez(carleton young)addressing the san mendelito council, as juarez was about 18 years old at this time (1824) and, though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in mexico's history, he surely hadn't achieved such prominence yet. his inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of warner brothers' juarez that year, which starred paul muni in the title role.<br /><br />this is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial, but also my favourite zorro film.<br /><br />* we are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year, what with gone with the wind, mr.smith goes to washington, the citadel, juarez, the wizard of oz, of mice and men, one million b.c.,zenobia, we want our mummy all counted among the output that year.<br /><br />** once again, juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850, about 25 years later. also, the political sub-divisions are referred to as 'provinces' in the story. in actuality, they are called 'states'. just as we are called the united states of america, so too,south of the border they call their repubhlic the united states of mexico.<br /><br />*** reed hadley was prominent in some very 'a' pictures in which his richly toned voice is exploited to good effect. watch & listen for his narration in the house on 92nd street (1945) and guadalcanal diary (1945).
