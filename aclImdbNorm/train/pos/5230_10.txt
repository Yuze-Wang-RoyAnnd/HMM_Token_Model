actually i liked this movie very, very much. not because of it`s plot, acting, jokes, no. i liked it, because it`s one of the worse movies ever created. it`s so lame, so bad, that it becomes terribly funny. some jokes are actually cool, but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the scriptwriter. "men in white" are so dumb and stupid, that you can do only two things. turn the tv off or roll on the floor laughing (beer helps a lot:). i chose the second option.
