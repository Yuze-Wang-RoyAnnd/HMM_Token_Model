four words account for why this film was made - "she done him wrong". the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay '90s melodramas were a viable proposition. here we are rewarded with a fast moving, well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars.<br /><br />wallace beery and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals; jackie cooper is a little harder to take, but it is fay wray who steals the film with her stock-in-trade damsel in distress. with a strong director - as walsh proves himself to be - wray could carry a lot of punch, and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and beery's affection.<br /><br />lots of atmosphere, beautifully designed, this is a forgotten film worthy of revival.
