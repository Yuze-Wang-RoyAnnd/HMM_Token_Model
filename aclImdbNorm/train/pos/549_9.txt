the year is 1896.jeff webster (james stewart) doesn't like people.there's only one friend he's got and he's ben tatum (walter brennan), an old sympathetic man.they're driving a cattle herd with them.that would be their key to richness.in skagway they run into trouble when sheriff gannon (john mcintire) takes the cattle.now jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the u.s. canadian border to dawson.now they have a group of other people with them, like the ladies ronda castle (ruth roman) and renee vallon (corinne calvet).there the two men get into the gold business.anthony mann's and james stewart's fourth collaboration, the far country (1954) is a fine western, indeed.the acting work is superb.walter brennan makes a terrific sidekick to stewart.ruth roman is brilliant and corinne calvet's delightful.jay c. flippen is very good as dawson marshal rube morris.the great jack elam and kathleen freeman are seen in smaller roles.it's fantastic to watch how jimmy stewart overcome's all the troubles in his way.there's just the man and his rifle.but also he's vulnerable.
