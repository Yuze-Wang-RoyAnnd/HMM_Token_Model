if you're researching ufo facts, then this video is very important. the 'meat' of the video is the comments made by buzz aldrin. he is without a doubt from the best of america. trained to be objective, honest and factual in his reports. many astronauts from america of all eras have reported some kind of contact, or ufo observance and there are videos from some of those missions. at the very least something has happened that requires further objective ongoing investigating. i think this testimony from buzz aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress. like all supposed documentary video, this one may be slanted, but it does contain further information and opinions from an accomplished american hero. those don't come along every day. so the fact that some people aren't interested in details should not detour your from viewing this video. if nothing else, it is interesting and i recommend you watch with an open mind.
