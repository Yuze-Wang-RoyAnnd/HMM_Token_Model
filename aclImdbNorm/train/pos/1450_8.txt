excellent political thriller, played much quieter and slower than other, higher ranking films in this genre. when people talk about pacino and cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances? a story of friendships, father-son relationships, corruption and deceit. the two actors gel amazingly well together, and the supports from aiello and fonda are equally as impressive, although aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers run to press. instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery, the final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted.
