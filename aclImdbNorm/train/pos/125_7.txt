lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques. some of them are very original while others are best forgotten.<br /><br />he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey. with so many cities lying in ruins, leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration. it is not a simple task as he quickly finds out.<br /><br />his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line. his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers. when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles. a terrible argument ensues when a passenger's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished. there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details.<br /><br />the railway journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations. in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half-starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz . these images, horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected.<br /><br />at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb. in view of many by-standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage. he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock. later he jumps from the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass on a river bank. looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock. if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task. quite ridiculous in fact. it could only happen in a dream.<br /><br />it's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train.<br /><br />despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, i prefer lars von trier's later films (breaking the waves and the idiots). the bomb scene described above really put me off. perhaps i'm a realist.
