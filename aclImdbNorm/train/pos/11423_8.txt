this movie shows life in northern cameroon from the perspective of a young french girl, france dalens, whose father is an official for the colonial (french) government, and whose family is one of the few white families around. it gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated. it's a sense consistent with another movie i've seen about africa in a similar time period (nirgendwo in afrika (2001)), but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. it's not just an impression -- things do happen in the movie -- but the plot is understated. the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers' forced upon him, although the framing of the story as a flashback from the woman's visit to south-western cameroon as an adult provides some perspective.
