i'll be honest with yall, i was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on abc i didn't think i would like it at all. but with john ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it, plus their was something else with it i liked. the acting was great, not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines, john ritter always brings his a game when it comes to comedy . this was a great show to watch, and i'll tell you why it was a great show. my father who never watches sitcoms at all, he just watches movies, sports, and law & order, he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother, and myself, and watched the show i think because john ritter was in it. i honestly think this show would still be running if john ritter god rest his soul i wish he hadn't passed away.
