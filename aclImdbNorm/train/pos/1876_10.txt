an adaption of the book 'finding fish'. this story is about a troubled young sailor antwone fisher (derek luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist jerome davenport (denzel washington). a brilliant debut performance by derek luke and an always stunning performance by denzel washington.<br /><br />this movie was incredible on so many levels and i was disappointed that it didn't win an oscar, i think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked. i strongly recommend this film to everyone, you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is antwone fisher.<br /><br />if you like inspirational true stories, then watch antwone fisher.<br /><br />thank you
