one of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene. i have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing, having tied my own flies, and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive brown trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them.<br /><br />when we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in.<br /><br />this was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons, norman and pauly carried out the ritual. for there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes. you can't just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best. you have to attune yourself to the place you are in, you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and, depending on your skill level, you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike. the 'art of fly-fishing' was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists.<br /><br />the title for the film could not be more aptly chosen, for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons. this film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in montana, by the the blackfoot river, where the film is played out. it has the capacity to draw you in, to enthrall you, to capture you, as the history of the family, community and period is unfolded. the story told is not just a family history, but a history of life. what may be classified as a 'river of life'
