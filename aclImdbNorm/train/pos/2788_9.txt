this is a so called 'feel-good' movies, however it made me sad in a way. why? because i had the talent, but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy, as well the fact that at the age of 12 i decided to quit soccer.<br /><br />and soccer is the red line in this movie. together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have. an english-indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand the english family with a daugther who dresses like a boy, and plays soccer... a combination which worries her mother! this movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people, as well as the indian community in england. it is about believe in your dreams, and live your one life (where did we hear that before).<br /><br />paraminder nagra (a beautiful women!) plays yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff. in contradiction with her sister pinky, complete the opposite of yasminda.<br /><br />a real must it is, to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents, and finds her luck eventually. with great music from blondie, curtis mayfield, texas, melanie c, as well as indian hit songs.<br /><br />pleasant to watch, but if you, as myself, ever played soccer, and never made it to the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.
