pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form. everything seems to pay homage to amelie and tim burton, but so what, in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare, this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not. it is just brilliant.<br /><br />i have been captivated from the start, the intelligent writing, the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire (ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on television).<br /><br />truly addictive and an absolute pleasure. perhaps like one of the piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways.
