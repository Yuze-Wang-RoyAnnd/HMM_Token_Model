in the movie several references are made in subtly to blade runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact the cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs, breed to be expendable warriors. but as favorite quote of mine from the movie is, " you should have made them smart as well as fast". kurt russell did a incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined. even when he falls in love with sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his shuddering when he is given a hug, and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded todd of himself, and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier.
