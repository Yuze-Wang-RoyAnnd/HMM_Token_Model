a fine martino outing, this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads, george hilton and anita strindberg.<br /><br />for me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate. just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists, enjoyable twists, it has to be said.<br /><br />sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london, athens and greek coastal locations. a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all.
