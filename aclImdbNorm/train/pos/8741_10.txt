"a bug's life" is like a favorite candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty.<br /><br />the story couldn't have been better; it's clever, has "heart" (emotion), and every character has a nice "arc" (a growth or change). by comparison, the only characters in "toy story" to have an "arc" are buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and woody, who overcomes his resentment of buzz. there are tons of laughs and cute moments in "a bug's life". all of the actors turn in great voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is superb.<br /><br />this serious movie buff doesn't throw around "10"s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the "10" i gave it.
