chances are is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (cybill shepherd) whose husband (christopher mcdonald) is killed shortly after learning she is pregnant. we then see the husband in heaven letting the powers that be know that he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him. he is told he can return to earth but not as himself. flashforward 19 years where we see shepherd's daughter (mary stuart masterson) preparing to graduate from college and encountering a young man (robert downey jr.)who, it turns out is the reincarnation of her father. the film is a little on the predictable side...the story goes all the places you expect it to, but it is so charmingly played by an energetic cast (especially shepherd and downey) that you can't help but get wrapped up in the fun. shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to better advantage and she and downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles. a lovely and charming fantasy that will engulf and enchant you.
