this series was just like what you would expect from mr.spielberg. it is truly one of those frighting, funny, childish shows that you won't forget. just like outer limits (another great show) this little series does what not a lot can. it was great, and deserved to run longer. it was a great show, that even kids could watch, though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be, but all of them always had a moral at the end (like the twilight zone) that made you realize what situation you didn't want to end up in, or ones that you did. i remember watching some of these on sci-fi when i was 10, and even now, i still enjoy seeing them when i can. truly a fun, imaginative show. i loved it, and still do.
