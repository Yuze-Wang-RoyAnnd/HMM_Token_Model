this drama is unlike sex and the city, where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other. its much more personal and people can relate to it. its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like "sex and the city, lipstick jungle...." <br /><br />dr. katie roden, is a psychologist with a dark secret, she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends. she is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her. her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well. <br /><br />trudi malloy, a widow is battling issues with "letting go" of her dead husband from 9/11. and when a handsome stranger, richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business. the ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between richard and trudi are totally funny! it is interesting to note that richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9/11 board for her husband's death..lets see what his intentions are <br /><br />siobhan dillon, a lawyer is fed up of her husband's love making tactics which only involve "baby making" (as they are having trouble conceiving) and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his "services" a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long!it will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband (played by raza jeffrey) jessica, a real estate business woman is single and is straight, until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them. her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a "married man", her colleague. lets see where her character venture to....<br /><br />the beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios, whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown. its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be "safe"!
