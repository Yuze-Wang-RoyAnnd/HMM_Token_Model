he now has a name, an identity, some memories and a a lost girlfriend. all he wanted was to disappear, but still, they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built. now he wants some explanation, and to get ride of the people how made him what he is. yeah, jason bourne is back, and this time, he 's here with a vengeance.<br /><br />ok, this movie doesn't have the most elaborated script in the world, but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. of course, like every hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90's, "the bourne suprematy" is a super-heroes story. jason bourne is a captain-america project-like, who's gone completely wrong. in the first movie, the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one. he now fights against what he considers like evil, after a person close to him has been killed (his girlfriend in "suprematy") by them. that's all a part of the super-hero story, including a character with (realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible) super powers.<br /><br />and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world (there's no frontiers in the bourne's movies, characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), is, as in the best seasons of "24", an american enemy, who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him. funny how "mad patriots" are now the n.1 enemies of paranoiac hollywood's stories.<br /><br />beside all those interesting thematics, the movie isn't flawless : the feminine character of nickie parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes. but all that doesn't really matter, for "the bourne ultimatum" is an action movie. and the action scenes are rather impressive.<br /><br />everyone here is talking about the "waterloo scene" and the "tanger pursuit" and everyone's right. i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger, that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of tsui hark. visually inventive scenes, lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on american's contemporary thematics : "the bourne ultimatum" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick.
