spanish films are into a, if not golden, definitely a silver age. pi'edras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously. although the feelings are strong or nearly at life or death-level, they still aren't really melodramatic. this could happen.<br /><br />there are different stories here, which become connected. one is about the retarded girl, who doesn't dare to pass the street to the next block. one is about the middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetischist. another is about the girl with drug problems who's lover leaves her. still another one is about the madame of a brothel who (almost) finds true love.<br /><br />definitely worth seeing. it's in spain the moviemakers take women seriously.
