starfucker (which reads starstruck on my box) was the most amazing movie i have ever seen. i thought that it was one of the best movies i have ever seen. so why not a 10? nothing is perfect. jamie kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of hollywood. i have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick.
