this is the finest film ever made to deal with the subject of aids. it's a documentary about two men living with and dying of this illness. the film is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny, and incredibly moving. above all, it is an amazing true love story. be sure to have a few hankies ready before you watch this movie---you will need them. extraordinary.
