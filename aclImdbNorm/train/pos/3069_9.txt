the effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business (albeit a unique one) all brought to a head by-- or perhaps the catalyst of-- a midlife crisis, are examined in the dark and absorbing drama, `panic,' written and directed by henry bromell, and starring william h. macy and donald sutherland. it's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must, of necessity, at last be resolved.<br /><br />	alex (macy) is tired; he has a loving wife, martha (tracey ullman), a precocious six-year-old son, sammy (david dorfman), a mail order business he runs out of the house, as well as his main source of income, the `family' business he shares with his father, michael (sutherland), and his mother, deidre (barbara bain). but he's empty; years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached, putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist, dr. josh parks (john ritter). and to make matters worse (or maybe better, depending upon perspective), in dr. parks' waiting room he meets a young woman, sarah cassidy (neve campbell), whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember. she quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him, as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her. his whole life, it seems, has become a `situation'-- one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves. he can deny his age and the fact that he has, indeed, slipped into a genuine midlife crisis, but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own. he's at a crossroads, and he's going to have to decide which way to go. and he's going to have to do it very soon.<br /><br />	from a concept that is intrinsically interesting, bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive, and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what alex is going through. he makes it very clear that there are no simple answers, that in real life there is no easy way out. his characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and, moreover, within any given family unit. the film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny, with irrevocable consequences and effects. when you're growing up, you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large; and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet, and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son. and it is at that point that alex finds himself as the story unfolds; ergo, the midlife crisis, or more specifically, the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape. it's a powerful message, succinctly and subtly conveyed by bromell, with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors.<br /><br />	for some time, william h. macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business, creating such diverse characters as quiz kid donnie smith in `magnolia,' the shoveler in `mystery men' and jerry lundegaard in `fargo.' and that's just a sampling of his many achievements. at one point in this film, sarah mentions alex's `sad eyes,' and it's a very telling comment, as therein lies the strength of macy's performance here, his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated, believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing. consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed, staring off into the darkness; in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling, not only with his immediate situation, but with everything in his life that has brought him, finally, to this point. in that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt, confusion and uncertainty, all of which have been successfully suppressed until now; all the things that have always been at the core of alex's life, only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing, demanding confrontation and resolution. it's a complex character created and delivered by macy with an absolute precision that makes alex truly memorable. it's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate. it's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around.<br /><br />	sutherland is extremely effective, as well; his michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it's chilling. it's frightening, in fact, to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth. this is not some pulp fiction or james bond type villain, but a true personification of evil, hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door, which is what makes it all the more disconcerting. and sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly, with a great performance.<br /><br />	neve campbell looks the part of sarah, but her performance (as is the usual case with her) seems somewhat pretentious, although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film. if only she would occasionally turn her energies inward, it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters. `panic,' however, is one of her best efforts; a powerful film that, in the end, is a journey well worth taking. 9/10. <br /><br />
