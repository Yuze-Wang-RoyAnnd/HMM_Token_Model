i have watched this movie well over 100-200 times, and i love it each and every time i watched it. yes, it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable. the camp shown in the movie is a real camp that i actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as camp really is, a great place to spend the summer. everyone who has ever gone to camp, wanted to go to camp, or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it'll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids.
