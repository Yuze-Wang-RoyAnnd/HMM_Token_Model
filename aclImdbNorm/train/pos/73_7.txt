this is essentially a variation on house of wax ,in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies ,vincent price.in both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by other,less talented and less scrupulous people .in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist ,the great rinaldo (john emery)insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs.price is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi. he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer.<br /><br />price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathy.the rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease .<br /><br />good solid b movie melodrama , this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece .shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
