i first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special. as time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film, which i will come to later. for a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while. when looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now being 15), i dug out the vhs of homeward bound. after watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain. the film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. the films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground, something that you all need. the way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic. in that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever, looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young american bulldog, with sassy the clever, vulnerable but confident cat. the film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen. <br /><br />i don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite, but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return, when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy, painfully are told by him to leave. when both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all. there is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. this film may not be lord of the rings but for disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10.
