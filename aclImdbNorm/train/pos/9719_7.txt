going into this movie, i had heard good things about it. coming out of it, i wasn't really amazed nor disappointed. simon pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies. there were a couple of laughs here and there-- nothing too funny. probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene. i totally gotta try that out next time i find myself in a club. a couple of stars here and there including: megan fox, kirsten dunst, that chick from x-files, and jeff bridges. i found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of thandie newton in a scene. she of course being in a previous movie with simon pegg, run fatboy run. i see it as a toss up, you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull. i might add, kirsten dunst is adorable in this movie. :3
