okay, so the plot is on shaky ground. yeah, all right, so there are some randomly inserted song and/or dance sequences (for example: adam's concert and henri's stage act). and leslie caron can't really, um, you know... act.<br /><br />but somehow, 'an american in paris' manages to come through it all as a polished, first-rate musical--largely on the basis of gene kelly's incredible dancing talent and choreography, and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with caron. (he needs to, because she seems to have a... problem with emoting.) <br /><br />the most accomplished and technically awe-inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet towards the end of the film. it's stunningly filmed, and kelly and caron dance beautifully. but my favourite number would have to be kelly's character singing 'i got rhythm' with a bunch of french school-children, then breaking into an array of american dances. it just goes to prove how you don't need special effects when you've got some real *talent*.<br /><br />not on the 'classics' level with 'singin' in the rain', but pretty high up there nonetheless. worth the watch!
