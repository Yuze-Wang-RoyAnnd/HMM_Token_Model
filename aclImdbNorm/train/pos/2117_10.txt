every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production. i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. everyone involved is perfect; script, acting, direction, sets and editing. whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance, and the supporting cast are magnificent, it is margaret sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was. her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve. lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best. watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take - breathtaking.
