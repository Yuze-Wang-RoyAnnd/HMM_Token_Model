i just found the imdb and searched this film and i was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as i did when 6 or so years old in 1967?. i saw it before the jungle book so i was eagle boy for a few hours and then mowgli for the next year. i burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the eagle and always wanted to see the film again. when we got home we had a roast chicken dinner and i got the wish bone and guess who i wished to be? my dad then said 'i bet you wished to be an eagle' and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses so more tears and a little resentment to this day for not being able to fly away...
