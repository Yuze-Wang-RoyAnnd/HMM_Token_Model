<br /><br />i just bought this movie on dvd and watched it for the first time the other night. i've been a fan of tolkien's work for about 4 years now, ever since i got out of high school. i didn't grow up on this movie...perhaps my mother kept me away from it. it's definitely not for children. not that it's bad in a graphic sense, but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads. overall, the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978/1979. i thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense. but i am bothered that bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the return of the king parts. that would've made it the ultimate movie. i was bothered by it's abrupt end, and then when i heard return of the king sucked, i was bothered even more. too bad it wasn't one great animation film. it might have garnered a higher vote from me. i give it a 7. i can only hope peter jackson will do the books justice with the new live action lotr.
