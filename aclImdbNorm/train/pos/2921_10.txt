the one and only was a great film. i had just finished viewing it on encorew on directv. i am an independent professional wrestler, and i thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler. now this film was made 4 years before i was born, but i don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. sad, funny, and all around great!!! **** 10+
