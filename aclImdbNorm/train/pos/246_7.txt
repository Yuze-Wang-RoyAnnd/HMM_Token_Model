how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together? well, i couldn't and so, i rented this mess of a movie.<br /><br />i had never heard of ned kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young man's legend. i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. perhaps the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow, i found this story difficult to follow. not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. even with a slow story, ledger and bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /><br />though i flounder to recommend this as a must see, it is a great story of australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film does have some good actions sequences. <br /><br />6/10 see it for historical value....(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;) )
