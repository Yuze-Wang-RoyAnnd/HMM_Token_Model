this film caught me off guard when it started out in a cafe located in arizona and a richard grieco,(rex),"dead easy",'04, decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot, sexy waitress. while rex steps out of the cafe, he sees a state trooper and asks him,"are you fast?" and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one. nancy allen (maggie hewitt),"dressed to kill,",'80, is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast. maggie winds up in a hot tub and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down, western style, with the local top cop in town. this is a different film, however, nancy allen and richard grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together!
