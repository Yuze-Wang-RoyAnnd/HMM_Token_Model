"the tenant" is roman polanski's greatest film imo. and i love "chinatown", but this one is so much more original and unconventional and downright creepy. it's also a great black comedy. some people i have shown this film to have been *very disturbed* by it afterwards so be forewarned it does affect some people that way. polanski does a great job acting the lead role in "the tenant" as well as directing it.
