an excellent period murder melodrama, with fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type, in a role that reportedly olivia dehavilland turned down. that's fine, because fontaine is wonderful. scripted by charles bennett, who had written for hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic british horror film night of the demon. the opening scene, where ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful una o'connor (the screecher of james whale fame), is a tour de force, and the film maintains interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations. i hope to see this film on dvd someday, but despair of that ever happening, because it seems to be an undeservedly obscure film. fortunately i got to see it on amc some seven or eight years ago, but have not seen since. catch it if you can!
