twisted, bizarre, enchanting, and hilarious! i couldn't stop laughing watching this film. darren stein presents the movies he made on the family camcorder growing up in southern california in the 1980's. it's an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera. manipulation is a strong word, however don't we all watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another? <br /><br />from the beginning, i was amused at the fact that the boys in the films seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible. later, darren comments about his budding homosexuality, and you can see it from the hints (big hints!) of flamboyance at an early age. maybe it was just the warm southern california weather, who knows? as a gay man who also grew up in a nurturing environment, it's great to see that his parents supported and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be entranced with his nascent talent behind the lens.<br /><br />"put the camera on me" offers a look back to the 80's untouched by commercialism. you'll remember the hair, the music, and the fashions. i'm the same age as mr. stein, so the trip back to memory lane was welcome. his solo lip-syncing dance number is priceless, enhanced by the frankie goes to hollywood t-shirt.<br /><br />the films deal with dark themes at time. child abuse, the holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy, and social dysfunction. no childhood is completely carefree, and the way stein deals with these subjects is interesting to say the least, and hilarious to behold.<br /><br />watch at your earliest convenience!
