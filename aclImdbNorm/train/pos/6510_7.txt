i actually really like what i've seen of this cartoon so far. sure, the animation isn't the best, but frankly, i'd rather see this type of more cartoony style done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply (which was starting to happen more and more often--it's only a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it). there's nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little black-dot eyes--in fact, i think it's really cute. as a kid i never thought scooby-doo's design was particularly adorable, but i think i might like it better know.<br /><br />anyway, shaggy has always been my favorite character, and believe it or not, but i think he has the most potential for some depth. sure, the show doesn't center around the original "mystery-solving" theme, but that was just a tired old formula anyway. don't get me wrong--i'm sure there are writers out there who would be able to bring a lot more interest to mystery inc.'s traditional pursuits (which has been lacking as late), but in the mean time this show is a fun deviation from the standard. shaggy and scooby are still funny, but no longer only comic relief. they're still cowardly, but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be (shock!) intelligence. they're the same old over-eating slackers as ever, but now actually seem to be getting on with their lives with the help of uncle albert's inheritance.<br /><br />i used to find most original scooby-doo jokes to be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best, but this show actually exercises a capacity for real humor. also, i never really like casey kasem as shaggy anyway, so the new actor doesn't annoy me as much as he does other people. (i still think billy west was the best, though)<br /><br />overall, while not a great cartoon in the scope of all of cartoon history, still an achievement among other scooby incarnations.
