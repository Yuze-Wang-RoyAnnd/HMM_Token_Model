jackie chan name is synonomus to stunts. this movie never let you down.the opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder ,if he knows the meaning of fear.this movie comes very close to jackie's best which is project a.but the main difference being that project a contains three stars where as in this movie jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders.this is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by bruce lee.the film has nice comic touches too. what makes this film work is jakie's ability to show his venerable side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action hero.this movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor.
