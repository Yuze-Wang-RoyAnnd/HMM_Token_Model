firstly, i would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors. anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly utter nonsense.<br /><br />creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects. the actors are highly believable, the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing. <br /><br />there is much mystique in this film. many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels. how was 'craig' created and what happened to him?<br /><br />a fantastic film with a large chill factor. a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 days later, the bunker, dog soldiers and deathwatch.<br /><br />look forward to more of these fantastic films!!
