gundam wing is a fun show. i appreciate it for getting me into gundam and anime in general. however, after watching its predecessors, such as mobile suit gundam, zeta gundam, and even g gundam, i find wing to be gundam lite.<br /><br />characters: an aspect long held by gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity. this does not happen in wing. heero is top dog at the beginning, and he's top dog at the end. personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. the best character is zechs, who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series. but suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason.<br /><br />mecha: wing has great suit designs. the gundams are super cool, with the epyon being my favorite. i even consider a few of the oz suit designs to be on par with some of the classic zeon suits. but sweet suit designs doesn't quite save the series from boring characters.<br /><br />conclusion: in the end, wing has cool fight scenes, though riddled with recycled animation, but shallow plot and character development. enjoyable, but not moving like previous gundam outings.
