this is a great british film. a cleverly observed script with many quotable lines, which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend. as per usual phil daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of british actors geoff bell. peter bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and gary stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece. although it seems to be billed as a biker movie, i think it will find an audience outside of this, purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t-shirt. also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of freebird. this really could be a 21st century heir to the famous ealing comedies. like the weed in the welsh fields: it's a grower!
