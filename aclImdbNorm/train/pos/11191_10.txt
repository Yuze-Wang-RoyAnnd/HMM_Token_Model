this scary and rather gory adaptation of stephen king's great novel features outstanding central performances by dale midkiff,fred gwynne(who sadly died few years ago)and denise crosby and some really gruesome gore effects.director mary lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style,and manages to make this one of the few versions of king's work that is not only worth seeing,but genuinely unnerving.the depiction of the zombie child gage(miko hughes-later in "new nightmare")is equally noteworthy,as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky.as for the people,who think that this one isn't scary-watch it alone in the dark(eventually with your squeamish girlfriend)and i guarantee you that "pet sematary" will creep you out.some horror movies like this one or "the texas chain saw massacre" shouldn't be watched in group.recommended for horror fans!
