reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when i watched it i could not stop laughing! it has officially become my new favourite movie.<br /><br />i don't know what all the hate here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. this one was almost all women - with the exception of seth meyers, justin hartley and the brief appearance of will arnett - and it worked. all of the actresses delivered very funny performances (especially missi pyle) from a quirky and lovable script.<br /><br />the charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />missi pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and i have to agree. everyone i've recommended this film to has loved it and i think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful.<br /><br />i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy.
