this is an astounding film. as well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust chavez, we are given the background picture which describes a class-divided society. many of the rich, it appears, have a choice with the people's democratic choice, and are willing to use the military for regime change. 'be careful what you say in front of your servants' is a revealing comment. the head of the country's biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president, with us backing, and these young irish film makers have it all on camera. a great film to educate young people about democracy. we see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated, and force used, in the interests of big business, against the interests of the democratic wishes of the people. riveting stuff.
