to begin with, i loved g"ota kanal 1, it had a lot of classic jokes including that unlucky guy in the canoe who always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, he is still acting the same guy in the g"ota kanal 2 movie but in my opinion hes performance is not as funny as it was in the first movie, in fact you don't notice him much at all. a thing that made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats, in this movie there are only race boats, they sure is speedy but those do not make waves like the big floating mansions used in the first movie, i liked the old ones better and these new boats makes one of the last scenes look ridiculous when the man in the canoe suddenly jumps out of it to evade the "big waves" from those small speedy boats. truly a minus. you have to accept that we're not living in the same sweden as in 1974 anymore. this movie also contains a bit more violence than the first one. although the movie was great all in all. i've just concentrated on some cons that i was disappointed in but the rest of the movie were up to my expectations, so go see it! it's worth the money.
