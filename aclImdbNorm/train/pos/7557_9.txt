gender bender the limerick:<br /><br />a man or a woman? who knows?<br /><br />it turns out that 'it' is both.<br /><br />sleeping in clay<br /><br />then they all went away<br /><br />in one of their ufos.<br /><br />gender bender is another great season 1 episode. i enjoy this one because the story is the kind where you are never really sure what's gonna happen next. it is entirely original. the teaser is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights. i really need to learn my that thumb trick the genderbender heshe does. i really like the atmosphere at the kindred's little village and mulder and scully sneaking around in the middle of the night. its very exciting. this is one of my favorite season 1 episodes in fact. i think the thing i like about it so much is how they turn out to be aliens in the end and left crop circles. many people see this as a non-mythology related alien episode kind of like "the unnatural" or "space" but i think this could easily be seen as mythology related. maybe the genderbender was just like the alien bounty hunter and could appear to look like anyone. huh? anyway i give the episode a 9 out of 10.
