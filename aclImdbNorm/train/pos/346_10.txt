what an awesome movie! it was very scary, great acting, well-written, nice plot twists, interesting characters, very good direction, and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non-horror fans, but is still (nonetheless) one of the best thrillers out there today! i highly recommend it to only fans of:<br /><br />1) the horror genre<br /><br />or<br /><br />2) an actor or actress featured in it.<br /><br />*** out of **** stars!<br /><br />ps- i am sick and tired of people comparing this, and other modern horror movies, with scream. ya know what, they didn't want to be like scream. everyone's like "oh, they copied scream!". well, if i am not mistaking, scream also copied other movies too! in fact, just about every horror movie copied an earlier one. scream, however, was a good film. but, still... stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is!<br /><br />go and rent this one!<br /><br />
