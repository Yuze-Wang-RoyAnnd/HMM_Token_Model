i'm going to keep this review short and sweet....<br /><br />i saw the trailer for this and thought i'd give it a whirl 5 minutes in and my initial thoughts were "what the hell is this?" but after 10 minutes i was hooked and after 20 i was picking my jaw up from off the floor. this film is a great example of how different a movie can be, and furthermore it's french. this film is high art eye candy wrapped up in a tidy futuristic film noir package, the motion capture is very clever and the black and white animation style which has no grey although at first didn't do it for me totally captivated me and by the end of the film and i found myself wishing every film was made like this. i think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing it would have been very easy to ruin it had they not landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters (just watch any hong kong legends film in english to see a perfect example)i gave it 9 although i gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels....
