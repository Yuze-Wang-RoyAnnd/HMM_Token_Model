i caught this movie late at night on cable, and i was pleasantly surprised. i can only imagine the reason this movie was not better known, is because the subject matter is very disturbing. but if you can handle the sexual abuse topic, it is a well acted, suspenseful and very interesting movie. both richard gere and claire daines are very good in it. and although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart, the movie doesn't go out of its way to be brutal either (like 8mm for instance).<br /><br />i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies.
