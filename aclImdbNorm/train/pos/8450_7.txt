was'nt really bad for raw's first ppv of 006. but the ending was really really shocking to everyone in attendance & the ones who were watching at home.<br /><br />first match- ric flair vs. edge w/ lita for the wwe intercontinental championship not a bad opener, these two can seriously put on a great match if they had more time to put on a wrestling match. flair wins by dq after edge slams him with his mitb briefcase. 3/10 second match- trish stratus vs. mickie james for the wwe women's championship not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time these divas faced off in the ring together. mickie goes for a modified chick kick, but trish ducks & nails her own chick kick for the win to retain her title. 3/10 third match- triple h vs. big show seriously good this match was, really. the whole match hhh focuses on big show's injured arm but big show still fights back. later hhh is able to topple down big show & nails a pedigree for the win. 5/10 fourth match- shelton benjamin w/ mama vs. viscera {this was a bonus match} not that bad, it was alright. after viscera was down, behind the referee, benjamin's mama got a purse {which had bricks in it} & slammed viscera on the head with it three times. viscera got up only to get caught with a spinning heel kick by benjamin for the win against the big man. 4/10<br /><br />fifth match- jerry 'the king' lawler vs. gregory helms boring, slow & sloppy. both men didn't really put a very good effort. jerry lawler wins after a fist drop for the win. 2/10<br /><br />sixth match- torrie wilson vs. victoria vs. ashley vs. maria vs. candice michelle in a first ever women's gauntlet match it was pretty entertaining to me. ashley {i think} eliminates candice last to win the first ever women's gauntlet match. 5/10 seventh match- john cena vs. chris masters vs. carlito vs. shawn michaels vs. kane vs. kurt angle w/ daivari in an elimination chamber match for the wwe championship it was a cool elimination chamber match. but nothing will top last year's elimination chamber which was the best. the last three are masters, cena & carlito. carlito turns his back on masters & gets a roll-up on him to eliminate him. seconds later cena gets a roll-up on carlito for the three count to win the elimination chamber & retain his wwe title. but his night was not over yet. 7/10 after the match, vince mcmahon comes out & congratulates cena for his victory. vince mcmahon states that his night is not over yet, & says that edge cashes in his money in the bank opportunity to challenge cena for the title. edge comes out with lita, gives the briefcase to vince & heads off in the ring as cena has one more match to go here tonight.<br /><br />eight match- john cena vs. edge w/ lita for the wwe championship {cena who is busted open during the chamber match} gets pounded straight away by edge, edge then nails a spear on cena, goes for the cover & to his shock cena breaks out. edge nails another spear & covers for the shocking three count as he has beat cena & has won the wwe championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 so last year's new years revolution was better than this year's, but it was still alright. the ec match was also good & the shocking of edge cashing in his mitb opportunity is definitely the most shockingest on the ppv show.<br /><br />overall: i'll give it 7/10 & a c
