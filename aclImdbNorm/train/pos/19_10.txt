i just read the comments of tomreynolds2004 and feel i have to jump in here. i understand he doesn't like the film, but his reasons are not evident. my feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sorrow. each of these two people, as portrayed, have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry, yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other. only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire, sentimental and sappy. i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances. i have every reason to dislike jane fonda for her vietnam era actions, but personal feelings apart, she is fabulous in this role. robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. this is the first i have seen deniro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and i really like it. this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again.
