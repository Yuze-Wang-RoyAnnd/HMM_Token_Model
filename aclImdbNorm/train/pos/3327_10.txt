i love and admire the farrelly brothers! how come i only got to see this great movie 3 years after it's release? it made me laugh, it made me cry and it reeeaally warmed my heart. big time. it's hard to describe in my rotten english - but i have to try anyway:<br /><br />the cast is excellent throughout - from the lead- to the supporting roles, the acting is great, the dialogs are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited.<br /><br />i think that the farrelly brothers movies are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they're deeeeeep! they talk about what life is all about (i won't tell you!).<br /><br />in my case, this movie affirmed to me what relationships are all about:<br /><br />if you love somebody: set them free, let them be - try to share the passion and the pain and always be true to each other.<br /><br />i'm not a sports-hater, but definitely a sports ignorant. but in this movie - the vibes get you. i could smell the atmosphere of baseball. finally, this movie explained to me what being a sports-fan can mean to you and what cool fan-families there must be out there.<br /><br />thanks so much, pete & bob!<br /><br />p.s.: if you haven't seen it - please check out kingpin!
