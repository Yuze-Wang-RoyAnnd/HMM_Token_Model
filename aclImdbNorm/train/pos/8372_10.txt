what a master piece. to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future. this film is satire of the highest order. in my humble opinion it outranks dr. strangelove.<br /><br />the clever naming of the two superpowers, as the confederation and the market. cons being commies and market, the west! outstanding. the clever use of gen joxs, was ahead of its time. only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering. robot joxs tackled the issue head on in 1989.<br /><br />the message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government. this movies screams don't do it you fools you'll kill us all.<br /><br />excellent 10/10
