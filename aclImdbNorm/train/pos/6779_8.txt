george cukor directs a brooding and cynical classic. the distinctive ronald coleman is at his best in this piece of noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles. the acclaimed anthony john(colman)has driven his wife brita(signe hasso)away with his highly fueled temper and erratic behavior. but the two manage to continue working together to please their audiences. things begin to change as john is becoming bored with his career; he reluctantly agrees to play othello. he gets deep into character as a jealous and murderous man. he begins walking a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his mistress(shelley winters),but has no memory of the dastardly deed.<br /><br />colman seems faultless in this role. winters is very impressive as the young woman determined to get away from her squalid life. also in the cast: edmond o'brien, ray collins, joe sawyer and whit bissell.
