although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film, the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb.<br /><br />yaara, studying at princeton, returns to her native israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend, talia. because yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother, she has lost her adoptive sister. and because yaara, blind from birth, has been guided and guarded by talia, her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable.<br /><br />inevitably, the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death. though without sight, she has insight. though she cannot see, she is able to find what is out of sight than the "normal" people around her. the film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as yaara scours for clues in memories of her relationship with talia, in her adoptive family's house, in tapes, diaries, and people in talia's past and present.<br /><br />told from yara's point of view, the film is also seen from her point of view, as she visualizes what she hears, believes, and imagines. the solution to the mystery is rather conventional, but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare, that the pat moment is easily forgiven. the truths emerge gradually yet inexorably, clarifying not only talia's life, but also her relationship with yaara. tali sharon, as yaara, uses her mobile face and voice effectively, and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl. we accept fully her ability by the film's end to find her place in the world more confidently.<br /><br />noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious, the dead-on acting by the minor characters, and the interesting decision to represent talia only as a teenager. i will quibble with yaara's final declaration as stands with gadi, talia's last boyfriend, at a cliff's edge, but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled.
