this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time. jonny kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love. watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching. listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming. and seeing him smile was indescribable. i feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant. please, if you ever have a chance to watch this film - consider yourself lucky to have met jonny kennedy.
