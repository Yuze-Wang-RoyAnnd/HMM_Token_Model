this film resembles in many ways `enemy of the state' with will smith and gene hackman, as we have an innocent (black) man being pursued by the `government' with all the modern technology known to man. usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster. that does not apply here. of course i love everything david morse does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were more good things about this film then that. the main baddy, played by doug hutchison, was brilliant, and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli. our hero, alvin sanders (played by jamie foxx), was however irritating most of the part. he is so out of place, cracking bad jokes, evoking no sympathy from the audience. or not to begin with, the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you (and on his followers as well!). i didn't expect much when i rented it, but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits. 7/10
