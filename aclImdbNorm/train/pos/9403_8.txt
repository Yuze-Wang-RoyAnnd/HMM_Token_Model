"the man in the white suit" is another feather in the cap of expert scottish director alexander mackendrick (whisky galore!, sweet smell of success). the star of the film is alec guinness (whose comedies include kind hearts and coronets and the lavender hill mob). guiness brings his usual class to the film, and makes it much more than a typical comedy.<br /><br />in fact, the comedy isn't entirely overt. by the end of the picture, it's nearly become a complete drama. it's the sort of ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to produce laughter, but a sense of general amusement, like the best british comedy of the time.<br /><br />the whole idea of the suit isn't very original, but the way it is executed is. the film is highly original, and recommended to any fan of guiness or britsh comedy.<br /><br />7.6 out of 10
