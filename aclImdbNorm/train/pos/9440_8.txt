"deliverance" is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970's decade from whence so many other exploitation films came.<br /><br />a group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives. it's awesome.<br /><br />we are treated to anal rape, vicious beatings, bow and arrow killings, shootings, broken bones, etc... a lot like 1974's "texas chainsaw massacre," to say that "deliverance" is believable would be immature. this would never and could never happen, even in the dark ages of 1972.<br /><br />"deliverance" is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action. it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70's and it (arguably) sits on top of that pile with it's great acting, superb cinematography and excellent writing.<br /><br />8 out of 10, kids.
