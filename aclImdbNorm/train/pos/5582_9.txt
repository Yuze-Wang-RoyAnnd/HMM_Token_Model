in 1930,europe received quite a shock when luis bunuel's 'l'age dor' was released, causing a riot in paris when screened there,resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years. three years later,in 1933,when europe had gotten over the shock,it was once again turned on it's ear with 'ekstase',a symphony (of sorts)to love. the film starred a young,unknown german actress named hedwig kiesler,who would later change her name to hedy lamarr,when she moved to america to escape the madness of adolf hitler,as eva,a young bride who has just married a cold,distant loveless husband (played by emil jerman),only to discover that she has made a major mistake. one divorce later,eva is footloose & fancy free & is out one day, skinny dipping in a lake,when she discovers adam,a handsome,young engineer (played by aribert mog)who takes a real fancy to her (and she,him). after a wild night of passion,eva's ex-husband turns up once again,hoping to win eva back,only to find he now has a rival. i won't spoil what transpires. czech director, gustav machaty (who directed the original screen version of 'madam x',another parable in romantic obsession) directs from a screenplay by jacques koerpel,frantisek horky & machaty,from the novel by robert horky. the film's velvety cinematography (which reminded me of avant garde photographer,man ray's photos of the era,which goes for some impressionistic use of light & shadow,a lot)is by hans androschin & jan stallich). the film's brisk editing is by antonin zelenka & the films art direction, which goes for a lush,nearly art deco look,is by bohumil hes). if i have any quirk about this film, it is the music score,by giuseppe becce,which goes for an over the top,melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast (certain themes are repeated over & over again,wearing out it's welcome,fast---kind of like some of david lean's over use of certain musical themes,especially in 'lawrence of arabia',and 'dr.zhivago'). some years back,a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material,cobbled together from various european existing prints available,restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the vatican condemned it as "decadent" (yeah,right...like the church never did anything wrong),and the hayes office cut it to ribbons,when it was finally released in the u.s.a. in 1936,in a "hayes office" approved cut (likewise). minimal dialog in german with english subtitles (it was meant to be a mainly visual experience). not rated,but contains that infamous nude skinny dipping scene by hedy lamarr (done tastefully,mind you) & some suggestions of sexual content (likewise)that would scarcely earn it a pg-13 rating,nowadays. worth a look if you have any interest in early european cinema,or avant garde/experimental cinema
