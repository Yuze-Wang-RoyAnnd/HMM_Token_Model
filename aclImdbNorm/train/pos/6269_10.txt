a pleasant surprise! i expected a further downgrade along the line: the rock (9)-->con air (7)-->armaggeddon (4). especially for such an overhyped film. perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare. clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it. fanboys expecting an armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. this is one for the more intelligent action fans. it didn't even bother me jolie appeared so little.
