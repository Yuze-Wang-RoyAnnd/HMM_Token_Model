i really enjoyed this movie as a young kid. at that age i thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was "cool" because of it's about sports. now, several years later, i can look back and see what a well designed movie this was. this movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues. that kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which i don't think is to our society's benefit. sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now, but they drew kids in. no seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children, but they will ask to see a movie about baseball. disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world.<br /><br />as a young adult the performance of al and the other angels seems far less impressive, however i will give credit to the actors playing both children and danny glover who all did a fantastic job.
