"this is not a love song" is a brilliant example of the chase genre, which many people think has an underlying meaning. the love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal. i believe that heaton is in love with spike, but spike is too naive to see this.<br /><br />i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences. heaton shows great intimacy towards spike. with intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing spike's name on the top of his letters.<br /><br />one thing i've noticed when looking at external reviews, is that when the film has been slated, the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film, as they haven't even mentioned the possibility of heaton having sexual feelings for spike. i also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven't recognised it, when they use phrases like: "who is heaton? what's he doing with a retard like spike?" this person, however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark. spike shows noticeable signs of having a.d.d, although i don't think this person has realised this, as he seems to be using the word "retard" as a derogatory term.<br /><br />i really enjoyed this film. although it is not for the faint hearted. the film is exceedingly character based, after the shooting until the end there isn't much but dialogue between the two anti-heroes. unless you are used to watching such deep, gritty films, stay well away.
