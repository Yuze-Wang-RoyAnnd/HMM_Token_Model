this is a hard-boiled warner brothers film starring a very young barbara stanwyck. a consummate master at portraying machiavellian cool, a technique she perfected eleven years later in billy wilder's "double indemnity", stanwyck plays lily powers, the well-worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel-town. she has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father's customers. once her father dies in a distillery explosion, she hops a freight train to new york and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank.<br /><br />this would come across as preposterous were it not for stanwyck's blazing work here. with her dead-eyed stare and amoral seduction methods, it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality. one of the young men she seduces along the way is a fresh-faced john wayne as of all things, an accountant named jimmy mccoy. the melodrama gets heavy-handed toward the last third of the film with a murder-suicide, a hush-hush job in paris to keep lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury. a tacked-on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before stanwyck sears the screen. the film has curious touches like lily's bonding friendship with an african-american woman named chico and the german immigrant who teaches lily about nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
