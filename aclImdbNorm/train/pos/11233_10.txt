i kind of consider myself as the #1 fan of hidden frontier, seeing as i am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys - well, not counting conventions, of course. i have been watching hidden frontier since 2001, and i must say i continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with.<br /><br />hidden frontier is the brainchild of rob caves and his self-made studio, areakt pictures, which operates out of the back room of his house. while not as "fancy" as, say, the tos-based series new voyages (which sometimes gets some of the actors/writers from the original series, like walter koenig, aka mr. chekov), rob and the cast and crew of hf manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called "enterprise". the most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of star trek's first openly gay character, corey aster (who was introduced in the second season), and his search to find a soul mate. somewhere later in the series, he meets jorian zen, the excelsior's trill helm officer. in the recent story lines with these two characters (warning: major spoiler! do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point!), zen is joined to an exiled symbiont, causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with aster. though the future is uncertain - seeing as the most recent episode, "beachhead", was just shown to hf fans in the chat room last night - i think that this relationship will endure, but only time will tell.<br /><br />gene roddenberry created star trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles. rob caves created hidden frontier for that same reason - and this is what has made this series as popular as it is. as the previous comment stated, i wish i could give it a rating higher than 10, but it will have to suffice. although next season will be the last - keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by star trek: the next generation - i am willing to bet that we will hear much about hidden frontier after that final episode.
