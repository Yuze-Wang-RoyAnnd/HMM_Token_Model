"and all through the house" is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season, but this episode was the first one i saw! i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever! i had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, and with this series started by hbo i again had fearful pleasure. this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist. "and all through the house" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy christmas eve, which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping! well anyway you have mary ellen trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. the odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a late holiday chopping on christmas eve! as from the old e.c. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for! well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream! also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!
