as did others in this forum, when "fobidden planet" was offered in 1956, i rushed to see it. this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such fare 'way out" all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well. this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as "flash gordon". leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role, at that time, but walter pigeon, marvin miller, anne francis, richard anderson, earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well. there are so many visual splendors in this one, it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes. the approach to altair-4, the starship itself, the landing on the planet's alien surface, the descent via extensor stairs, the first view of the landscape, the approach of the rocket-sled, dr. morbius's house seen from without and from within, the underground complex and its wonders, the setup of the weaponry, the battle with the monster, the final approach of the unseen destroyer,the escape from the doomed planet--all these scenes are etched into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants. veteran cyril hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long-time director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination. it is a shock to realize there's no music at all; the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline. it can be watched again and again with pleasure--i have been doing so for nearly fifty years. until this famous and well-loved film was created, no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth; and for decades afterward, ships kept crashing back on the planet--as if the writers' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes. still the best, many say. that says something negative about this nation's so-called intellectual leaders' imaginations--and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem.
