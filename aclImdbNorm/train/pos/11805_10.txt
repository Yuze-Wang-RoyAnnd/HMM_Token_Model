fragglerock is excellent in the way that schindler's list was excellent. a great watch for children and adults of all genders. big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols, in the same way that h.r. puff n stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking. your kids will love this movie. i enjoyed it very much as a child. my father showed me this movie as a child. he enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. although at the time i had no clue about what those were. the movie is comedy and adventure. the storyline is wacky and cheerful. i and you shall enjoy this together.
