laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. the message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better! the art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this, (im not sure if this was the first time i heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack. sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, pazu is also a great role-model--he lives on his own! the plot is classic miyazaki. i won't give it away, but the end is really great. i rank this as one of miyazaki's three best with nausicaa and spirited away. also you may want to check out howl's moving castle when it comes out (sometime next year i hope) if you like miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the usa. enjoy, piper a
