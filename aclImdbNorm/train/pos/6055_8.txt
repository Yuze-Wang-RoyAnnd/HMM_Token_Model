i was not expecting much from this movie, but was very pleasantly surprised, as it is light and funny and very well observed. the central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug-centred trip to wales. the humour was gentle and subtle, as indeed were the three characters (witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper). the atmospherics of rural wales were captured perfectly, and the soundtrack was very well chosen. cleverly and carefully scripted, with great attention to detail - i have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture - i felt i was there with them. very light in touch and full of fun - not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. a delight on all fronts, and difficult to criticise, though i thought the last two scenes were a bit lame - the film should have ended when they left wales. but overall, an unexpected treasure of a film.
