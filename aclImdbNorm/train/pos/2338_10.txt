many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been attempted. that may be so, but the addition of the narrator and dr.suess like scenery makes this show a must watch. with adult innuendo throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set, the show is both reminiscent and invigorating. the investigative portion of the show is not what drags viewers in. the twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise are what keep loyal viewers coming back for more. this is a success that abc should never let go of. bravo abc. lost was getting old, way to revitalize prime time. 9 episodes prior to the writers strike left audiences wanting more.
