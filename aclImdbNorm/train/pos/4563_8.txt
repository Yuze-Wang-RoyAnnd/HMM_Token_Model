hard to imagine this film is based on a true story, and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart-stirring. daniel day-lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character. watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience.<br /><br />the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before, the story is kinda bright and intriguing. christy is not despised by the normals, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes.<br /><br />one important factor of christy's success is his mother's support which seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role, this fat little middle-aged woman uses her all to make christy's dream come true. so lucky for christy!and hugh o'conor is also excellent as young christy, what a performance for a child! the love story of christy is very well-done, trustful. christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love, his crush on the beautiful dr. eileen cole (surprisingly played by fiona shaw, i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series, the loathsome aunt petunia, so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth...) is paranoiac and offensive, i do have sympathy for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and agony are just next to each other.<br /><br />btw, jim sheridan's works are all good (in america, the boxer etc.) except get rich or die trying', god knows why he chose to direct that crap! really a career taint for him, what a pity!
