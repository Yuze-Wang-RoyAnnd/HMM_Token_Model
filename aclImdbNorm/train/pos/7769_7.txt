lauren bacall was living through husband humprey bogarts illness & death when she did this film. rock hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom. dorothy malone is in excellent form, and wins an oscar for support. robert stack is nominated & falls just short for his role.<br /><br />the story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas. amazing how well drunks can drive in this film & also how quickly stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences.<br /><br />you can see why the cast is so good & actually production wise this film is very good. you can tell bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in some sequences.<br /><br />the sexual references in this film are so mild, that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are. film does a good job telling a story & actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made- though written beyond the wind would be a good title.
