dudley moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. this film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent. without dudley moore, john gielgud, liza minnelli, and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. it is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood (the "psycho"-like music at the wedding fight), but the acting overcomes it. the character arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. but he develops well into a more mature, well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will. the end is fairly corny, though. i wont give it away, but it could be improved. worth seeing many times.
