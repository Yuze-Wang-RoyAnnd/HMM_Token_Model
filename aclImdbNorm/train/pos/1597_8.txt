this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm-chair and mellow for a couple of hours. wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage (as always) gently row the plot along. there are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and witty paddle through new york life at its best. a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.
