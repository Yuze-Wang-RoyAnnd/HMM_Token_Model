actually this movie has silly moments, both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and children part, and it's much worse than other mj movies like "the wiz", "captain eo" and "ghosts". but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years, (yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), i can't complain too much about it. just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. but as a movie, it's not good at all, and i'm afraid, that it would get a much lower grade for me, if my darling mike hadn't been the one starring in it. but since no one but mike is the moonwalker, it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me.
