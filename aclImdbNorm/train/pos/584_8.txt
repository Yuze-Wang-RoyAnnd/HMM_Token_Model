excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years. starting around 1910, he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood; his family, friends, romances, etc. very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale...."all things in life come together as one, and a river runs through it. and that river haunts me." worth seeing.
