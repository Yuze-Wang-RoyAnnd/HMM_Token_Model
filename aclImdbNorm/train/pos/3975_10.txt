if you lived through the 60s, this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous. it's all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time. these are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out: "don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin, for the times they are a-changin'". while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of lsd and it's dissemination at the time, that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia, influencing engineers, scientists and aiding in the hyper-development of computer related activities. a salute to the filmmakers from one who was there - you've captured the era better than i've seen before.
