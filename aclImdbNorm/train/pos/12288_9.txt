the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue, south american politics and super-natural powers. meryl streep, glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allende's novel to life with all its passion and suspense. this, in my view, is one of the best films of the 1990s. jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably, while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture. glenn close, as esteban's sister, gives a very moving performance. the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical latin american country. settings of clara's home and esteban's ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post-war atmosphere.
