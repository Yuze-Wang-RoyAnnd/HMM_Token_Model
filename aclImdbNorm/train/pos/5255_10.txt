tim meadows has to be the most underrated of snl's recent cast members. what initially was a low-brow look at a sleazy gigilo develops into a thoroughly entertaining 90 minute run, albeit, still low-brow. don't pop this one in expecting beautiful cinematography or oscar-worthy performances. walk into it expecting brilliant silliness with tim meadows and will ferrell doing what they do best - making the audience laugh.<br /><br />leon "the ladies' man" phelps is a naive, likable radio sex show host who knows very little about anything except the ways of the wang. as a gifted ladies man, he lays waste to the wives of countless saps who've banded together in order to hunt him down. the director does an inspired job of guiding the actors on a comedic tryst which makes up completely for the lack of plot development. how much plot would one expect from an snl skit? while some scenes are a little off the mark, for the most part, meadows' one liners and absurd sexual comments hit the funny bone squarely. for instance, in one scene, meadows compares himself to mother theresa, but for bonin'. sure it's crass, but don't we all in the privacy of our homes get a chuckle out of his advice to an entire city for "doin' it in the butt"? in another scene, immediately after a heartfelt kiss with the female lead, he suddenly remembers the name of his would be benefactor, a woman he slept with years ago. he stands up in front of the woman who's obviously fallen for him and proclaims that "the ladies' man is back," to her obvious chagrin.<br /><br />billy dee williams hits the ball out of the park as the bartender/narrator. will ferrell, the repressed homosexual, rounds out solid performances.<br /><br />see this movie if you're into adult humor. if not, stay away with extreme prejudice.
