although john woo's hard boiled is my number 1 favorite movie. but i have to say police story is my number 2 favorite movie. i say this because the stunts, the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when jackie chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with chrismas lights and slid down the pole fell through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor. ouch! buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (or something in 14 dollars.)vhs new line home video. any questions or comments please feel free to reply. (i'm only 14 but i know where you can find any movie ever made.) if you looking everywhere for a movie and can't find it please reply to me. thank you and good night!
