i found this film to be the usual french slap in america's face. the camera, all too often, focuses on fat people, on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas. while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer, the cinematography exploits and demeans them. there were, undoubtedly, thin people to be seen in glencoe and neat, organized homes, but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen. <br /><br />i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements. i can assure you, as a frequent visitor to france, that all is not well there. foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated, thus creating severe social inequities. but americans are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the u.s., so we're not likely to see films on the subject.
