on the eighth day god created georges. but the same as an eighth day doesn't fit into the week, georges doesn't fit into the modern world: he has down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, shunted off to an asylum after his mother's death four years ago. she was the only one who loved him.<br /><br />harry is another man that isn't loved anymore. his wife has left him, for reasons that she is unable to explain. he loses the love of his daughters, too, when he arrives too late at the railway station to collect the two kids, who wanted to spend the weekend with their father.<br /><br />harry is a highly ranked businessman. he knows all the rules that enable us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. but he has entered a state of crisis, which reaches a climax after the loss of the love of his daughters. he questions the sense of his life, without obtaining any definite results.<br /><br />harry and georges meet. at first harry tries to get rid of georges, the same as all the others do. but georges can't be shaken off. and it gradually dawns on harry, how much he needs georges, if he wants to get over his identity crisis. it is georges who opens a new access to the world for him and who makes him view his life with different eyes. friendship and human warmth take the place of calculating striving for success. it is no surprise that harry now cannot avoid failing in his job.<br /><br />georges helps harry to regain the recognition of the daughters. even his wife has to admit that the fireworks which he organized were worth seeing. nonetheless a reintegration into the old life is no longer possible. and the new one turns out to be nothing more than a dream with a time limit, which unstoppably will reach its end. the camera watches harry and georges from above, for one long minute, as they are both lying down in the grass, just savoring the moment. but the same as this minute will unavoidably go by, the friendship of the two men, which came into being in such a wondrous fashion, will not be long-lasting. georges is destroyed by the impossibility of love to the opposite sex and can see no other way out but to commit suicide. harry turns into a city tramp, who asks the car drivers that are waiting in front of the traffic lights for charity.<br /><br />the movie describes modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism which devours positive values such as human warmheartedness or friendship. it is georges, the mongol, who seems to be capable of showing the way out of the dilemma, but unfortunately his plea comes to a bad end. however, his failure does not necessarily have to mean that it is impossible or not desirable to reach the aspired goal. the way he shows us is surely passable, although it requires a huge amount of willpower and, above all, the courage to apply a radical nonconformism.
