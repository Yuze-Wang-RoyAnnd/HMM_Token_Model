"birth of the beatles", for being a us television movie, released in the fall of 1979 has actually been, so far the best movie which tells the tale of the the four lads from liverpool that revolutionized the music industry and the world. as told by the point of view of former beatle pete best. the performance from the entire cast is excellent but, most especially the performance by stephen mackenna as john lennon and rod culbertson as paul mccartney. the film was produced by a legend of the rock and roll era,mr dick clark. who a year earlier in 1978 had produced another tv movie, that has stood the test of time starring "kurt rusell" in the lead role about another musical legend; "elvis". that movie was directed by an unknown director named "john carpenter" who went on to direct other successful movies such as; "halloween","escape from new york", and "the thing". the same can be said for the director of the "birth of the beatles", mr richard marquand. he went on to direct other theatrical blockbusters such as "star wars return of the jedi","eye of the needle",and "jagged edge" among many. the only other film that tells the story of the fab four that i know of,is back beat which had a theatrical release in 1994. however, the critics did not care for it,nor did the public, for it did not have a long life span in the theater. birth of the beatles is very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggles & hardships they went thru and ends at there pinnacle of success when they arrive in nyc and appear in the ed sullivan show in 1964. i highly recommend this film.
