this was fun to watch, spookily atmospheric and effects were pretty good considering they were bang in the middle of world war two. the plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villains getting their comeuppance.<br /><br />it must have been a good one to watch at the local flea pit in the 1940's when they were facing the biggest threat to their liberty from the nazis - well made with quite a serious message about the dangers to britain from third columnists.<br /><br />but arthur askey was so annoying & unfunny you just wanted him to shut up - well at least i did ! i suppose different tastes in different times but the clowning around became tiresome. if he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded.<br /><br />a good watch and quite short at just over 80 minutes - a good background for older kids too so they have an idea of what train travel in austere times was like; uncomfortable slow, dirty trains, being thrown off for no reason, surly staff ....
