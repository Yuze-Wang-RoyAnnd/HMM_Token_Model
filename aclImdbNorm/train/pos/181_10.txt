uc 0079, the one year war is almost at an end. a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops, a zeon task force. their target, a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes (supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga) inside. when little boy al izuruha, a fan of zeon ms, encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony, he befriends newbie ms pilot benard "bernie" wiseman. the two become good friends, al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team. through the show, bernie acts as a father figure to al (whose real father is always working) and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie, but eventually they must meet....in battle. al soon learns that war is not child's play and bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission.<br /><br />for only 6 episodes, gundam 0080 is a well done show. the mobile suits are extremely well designed, and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters. if you liked 0083 then check this one out, or if you are new to the gundam world, this is a good show to start with. if you look to a show for drama and character development, this is the one for you, it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle. i would rate it more of a drama than action.<br /><br />mobile suit gundam 0080, war in the pocket. <br /><br />sometimes you have to lose to win.
