i have to point out, before you read this review, that in no way, is this a statement against iranian people ... if you really want to read something into it, than hopefully you see, that i'm against politicians in general ... but if you're looking to be offended ... i can't help you!<br /><br />not in iran as this movie is banned there (see imdb trivia for this movie). which is a shame, because the movie is great. would it not be for "grbavica", this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin.<br /><br />rightfully so (it was the runner-up, or second place if you will). why? because it is a movie about oppression. it's not even that this is a complete women issue. it is about the government trying to keep the people down. an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie. but by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear! <br /><br />another reviewer had a great summary line: "comedy about a tragedy", that sums it up pretty well!
