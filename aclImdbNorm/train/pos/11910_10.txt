a delightful little thriller opens with trevor howard in his jag convertible and ends on a dockside in liverpool. it's all thrills and spills as the ex-spy has to restart his career just as he's getting some serious r & r cataloguing butterflies (how british is that?).<br /><br />trevor howard and jean simmons frolic from london to newcastle-upon-tyne to liverpool (via ullswater) - he's just been thrown out of mi5 or something, and she, you guessed it, is on the run, wrongly accused of murder. there's seedy docks, rolling lake district hills, sheep, country pubs, coppers getting lost, waterfalls, a bunch of amateur cyclists, rooftop chases, and lots of chinamen (don't ask), and it's all very hitchcocky and hannayesque...<br /><br />..and a smashing example of british noir...
