this film is a wonderfully simplistic work. enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time. the performances from miranda otto (oh, how she deserves so much more recognition!)and george del hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch, as the two tortured souls come to understand each other. the supporting cast of workers at the dead letter office are wonderful bit-parts in them selves, as is alice's long-suffering boyfriend, who i couldn't help but feel slightly sorry for. there's one particular scene i could watch over and over (and i have!), it's such a shame that films like these don't get recognition, and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy. i cried, i laughed and i sighed. i'd recommend this film to anyone.
