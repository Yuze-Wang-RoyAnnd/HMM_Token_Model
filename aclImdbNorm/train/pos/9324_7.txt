i've read a few of the reviews and i'm kinda sad that a lot of the story seems glossed over. its easy to do because its not a book, its a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- us or canadian- or anywhere.<br /><br />colm feore does, at least for a recovering "f@g-hag" like myself, a great job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- but playing sick. i mean, the man really can't get much more pale! though, you might never know it from the strip down near the... um, end.<br /><br />if you need decrepit, there are a few sking movies you might like.<br /><br />being the daughter of a recovering alchoholic, the druggie brother {david cubitt} was the trick for me. i'm going to give him cred, he grew up quick- and believe me that's good. and, as an aspiring writer, moimeme, i can dig a lot of his insights and overviews. but i'm more prosy than poetic.<br /><br />i may be easy to please, but i enjoyed it. a nice story pretty well put together- by canadians, quelle surprise. just toed the line of the 'movie of the week,' missing it by not being as drawn out, greatly appreciated. and it was rather cleverly portrayed.
