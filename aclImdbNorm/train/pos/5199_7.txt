not only is this a great african-american classic comedy, but one of many great american cult classics.i have recently purchased the collection edition of rudy ray moore.if you love the old school karate movies and black comedies, this is for you! they don't make movies like these anymore. my entire family are movie buffs, so this site is an extreme help on solving many debates. i am deployed in iraq right now. this helps me to stay connected to world that i know in the states. thank you imdb.i recommend this site to all my friends. dolemite rules! don't just take my word for it, check them out for yourself. ten lines is a lot for commenting on one movie i think, but if it gets the point across, i'm all for it!
