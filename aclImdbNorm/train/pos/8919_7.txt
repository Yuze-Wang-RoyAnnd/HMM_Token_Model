who would think andy griffith's "helen crump" (aneta corsaut) had a steve mcqueen movie in her past? but that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie, which might best be described as rebel without a cause meets god knows what from outer space. the rebel is steven mcqueen (who would shortly decide that "steve" sounded less prissy), a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned aneta corsaut. it was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders, but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous, man-eating what is it that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor--and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left. but will the grown ups believe them? of course not, what do they know, they're just kids!<br /><br />the movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best. the actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously, with many a soulful look into each other eyes, and the "adult" supporting cast probably says "kids!" very third sentence or so. but the real pleasure of the film its creature, which is well imagined, well-executed, and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense. and although clearly on the cheap side (check out those miniature sets, guys!), the blob is actually a fairly well-made film--and there's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure. the 40-plus crowd (myself included) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia, but that won't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility, and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated "grown ups only" get together. make plenty of jello cubes for movie snacking! gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer
