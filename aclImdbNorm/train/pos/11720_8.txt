i wasn't expecting much, and, to be honest, i didn't like this film the first time around but watching it again and i realised that it's kinda cool. sure, it's a one joke film but it's a funny gag. <br /><br />someone posted that it could be better written and it could be. i think this film had the potential to be a over-the-top my cousin vinny. but with a horror host instead of a lawyer. sadly it's a wasted opportunity. with just a bit more writing it could be a classic. the kids are underused there's no reason why they should latch on to elvira. apart from the obvious reasons. it would have been great to see their relationship flourish. i know it's a comedy but it's little differences that separate the good films from the brilliant.<br /><br />elvira herself is always fun and engaging. not to mention flirty. every time she smiles you will too. it's hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming. and it really is her charm, don't let her looks fool you into thinking that she's some sort of tart. well she is. but she's a nice one. the sort of person you'd let look after your kids. wouldn't let her cook for them, though...<br /><br />i'd recommend giving it a go. <br /><br />just don't expect too much.<br /><br />she's more than just a great set of boobs. she's also an incredible pair of legs.
