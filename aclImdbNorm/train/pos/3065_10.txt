<br /><br />i really liked this film. one of those rare films that hollywood really does not make anymore. william h macy is just great as the hit man with a soul, and neve campbell is just flat out fantastic as the woman who puts his life on the track of redemption.<br /><br />if you have a chance, see this film. it earns it's praise
