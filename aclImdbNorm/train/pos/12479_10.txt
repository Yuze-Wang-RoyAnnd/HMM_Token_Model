what are the odds of a "mermaid" helium balloon traveling from yuba city, ca.(on nov 8th,1993) and landing 4 days later,(on nov. 12) in mermaid, prince edward island, canada.(approx. 4000 miles). this is a great movie. it is based on a true story. this movie helps not only children cope with losses, but older people as well. hope everyone will enjoy it!!! rhonda
