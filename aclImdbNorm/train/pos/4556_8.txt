i watched this film in shire joy.<br /><br />this is possibly one of the best films of all time. it has a timeless value, you can get so much out of it it's amazing. there are parts that are moving, funny, and just great.<br /><br />all aspect are spot on, the portrayal of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% genuine, even small irish subtleties have been covered.<br /><br />the use of low and high shots gives two great views on cristy (look out for that).<br /><br />daniel day-lewis's performance is incredible. i've never seen an actor do that, ever. it really is amazing.<br /><br />and it's so great to watch, it flows so well, it's probably the closest thing yo can get to real life experience. i love it.<br /><br />if you haven't seen it, you should see it. don't have any doubts on it, there is something there for all.
