i've never been a fan of farrah fawcett...until now. she was truly amazing in this movie. the emotion she must have gone through shooting re-take after re-take doesn't bare thinking about. this was a very hard movie to watch, the subject matter is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity. i actually felt that the whole thing deflated somewhat when her friends returned to the house and i didn't find the conclusion at all plausible. the director seemed very keen in using height in his shots and loved using mirror reflections, i believe he should have paid more attention to the pace in the second half of this piece. i'm sure this makes a heck of a powerful piece of theatre, this movie for me, although it had merit, just fell short.
