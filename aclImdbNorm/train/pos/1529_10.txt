diagnosis murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on tv now. the way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today's shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side. the way mark's brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking, and if you think you do, you are wrong.<br /><br />diagnosis murder has tackled a diverse range of topics, not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives. everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology.<br /><br />as for it being for old people? i am 24!! i don't think i can be classed as old yet.<br /><br />i just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on dvd (not ntsc) so that i can watch them all in order. they seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit!
