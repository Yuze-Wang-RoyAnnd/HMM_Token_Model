well, if you are open-minded enough to have liked barber shop, then you will like this canadian film.<br /><br />if your mind is as closed-minded as fort knox, then you will give it the current score that it has : 2.5.<br /><br />this is a film for anybody prepared to watch films from outside of their own racial grounds. it is engaging, it is true to life, on two or three occasions you lose the connections between the scenes, but many times, especially towards the end, you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it so often mirrors what life can be like.<br /><br />i like it and recommend it to anyone open minded beyond the traditional american film.
