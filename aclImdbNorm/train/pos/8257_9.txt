just saw the world preem of fido at the toronto international film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered (certainly 'fleshed out' extensively and successfully) by george romero. but this is a canadian film by a canadian director and it's a comedy! and, yes, i actually think it is better than 'shawn of the dead'. thoroughly believable and, perhaps even more importantly, enjoyable performances by dylan baker, carrie-anne moss and young actor k'sun ray, whom i suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of in future features. however, i must confess that i most enjoyed the delicious turn by tim blake nelson as neighbour mr. theopolis, essentially playing a willing animated version of victor van dort from the corpse bride (or, for those who've seen the film, wouldn't that read even better here as the corpse pride?) and, of course, scotch actor billy connolly in his least animated, yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character. just think, he would not have gotten this role had it not been for peter stormare's commitments to prison break (as was revealed in the q&a following thursday night's screening). i can't help but speculate that the screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from day of the dead's zombie 'bub'.i am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a comment and i won't start now. suffice it to say that fido is not one of those dour, graphically gory zombie films you can rely on from romero. rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and, although (and i did have to think back carefully to be sure) there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence, the delectable humour, so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by director currie and his co-screenwriters, goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated pg-13. i urge you to go see this little canuck gem. i'll certainly be buying the dvd once it emerges hopefully by next summer.
