hello, this little film is interesting especially for an artist, film-maker or music creator or a visual artist, for:<br /><br />one can feel and examine david's touch/style straight out of a short piece of relative simplicity.<br /><br />you can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots, the pans and the sound elements. <br /><br />even as simple film, this creation is multy-layer. for example, there are some sounds that drone all along, while others appear (though subtle), at certain points to support certain shots.<br /><br />one can see also several types of pans: some go up and down in a gentle back-forth way. there is diagonal pan. zooms also go back and forth sometimes.<br /><br />the lightning and the composition/disposition of elements in the space is, as usual and obviously, work of a painer/artist. this can be felt even in this crappy room. this is to say: one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look/view and composing the scene. then comes the forcelines of the visuals: like digonales, parallels, etc. the light's degrad'ees and the colours, although without too much research for textures as in big productions, are fine too. this is an artist's sketch of a sort...<br /><br />all this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the david's touch/feel to it, as with any true artist.
