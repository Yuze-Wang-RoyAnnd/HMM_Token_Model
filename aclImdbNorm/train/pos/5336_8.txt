i really like this movie because in australia, chinese movies like these never get shown during prime time. i must say this is one of the best serious movies ever, which outlines the difference between the hong kong people, and mainland chinese. it really shows that there's discomfort between the two, but can only get better as hk are learning mandarin. it also showed me how in mainland china the indie rock scene exists, and that chinese people do know how to strum the guitar and get the house funking! whoever said china isn't ready for rock music? daniel wu is absolutely superb, with his clean and crisp voice, honest acting, and a total chick magnet. i recommend this movie to those who don't know much about asian people to cleanse themselves from the typical western stereotypes, and people who just love chinese/asian cinema like myself. check it out!
