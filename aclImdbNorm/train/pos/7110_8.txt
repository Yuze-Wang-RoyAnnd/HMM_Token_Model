john garfield plays a marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability. he has all the stereotypical notions about blindness, and is sure he'll be a burden to everyone. the hospital staff and his fellow wounded marines can't get through to him. neither can his girl back home played by eleanor parker. he's stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self pity, and prejudices. it's a complex role that garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama. the best scenes are on guadalcanal, where he's in a machine gun nest trying to fend off the advancing japanese soldiers in a hellish looking night time battle, and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white cane, dark glasses, and holding out a tin cup, all the while his girlfriend walks backward away from the camera.
