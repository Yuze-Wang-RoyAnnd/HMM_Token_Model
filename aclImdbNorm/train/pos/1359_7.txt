i work in a library and expected to like this movie when it came out 5 years ago. well i liked parker posey a lot (she's a wonderful actress) and omar townsend was really cute as her boyfriend (he couldn't act but when you look like him who cares?) but the movie was bad. it wasn't funny or cute or much of anything. posey kept the movie afloat with her energy. but she learned the dewey decimal system overnight and then shelves tons of books to the beat of music??!!!!??? come on! also i did have a problem with the way she looked when she became a full-fledged librarian at the end--hair in a bun, glasses, no sense of humor--can we let that stereotype go please? worth seeing for posey and townsend but that's about it. the tv series was much better.
