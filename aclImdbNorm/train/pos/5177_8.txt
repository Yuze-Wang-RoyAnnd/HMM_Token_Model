i watched this last night after not having seen it for several years. it really is a fun little film, with a bunch of faces you didn't know were in it. arkin shines as always. check it out; you won't be dissappointed. by the way, it was just released on dvd and contrary to its packaging, it is widescreen. the transfer is rather poor, but at least the whole movie is visible. ;-)
