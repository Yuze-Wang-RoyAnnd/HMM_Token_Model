this was soul-provoking! i am an iranian, and living in th 21st century, i didn't know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather!<br /><br />you see that today, or even in 1925, on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on-demand, but here 80 years ago, people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass. it's really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep, but they lose many the sheep on their way.<br /><br />i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as tough as bakhtiari people.
