this is a fantasy movie for kids based on the boggy creek legend although i don't know why they called it return to boggy creek as if it's a sequel.this movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare. dawn wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around boggy creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid. yes it's very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8-12 y/o group which it targeted. it's harmless g-rated kiddie fare and at least you don't have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it. strictly for the 8-12 y/o set ,older kids will get bored and think it lame.
