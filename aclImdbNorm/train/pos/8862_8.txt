sydney lumet hasn't had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at 83 has managed to churn out a tight, well-cast, suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground, new york city. (how he got insurance, let alone the budget after all those flops, is a mystery also). the story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene.<br /><br />two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents. the only victim is going to be the insurance company. the robbery goes awry and two people die. most of the film is concerned with the aftermath. the action is non-linear and seen from the main character's differing points of view, but it is not difficult to follow. what is not so easy to work out is the back story
