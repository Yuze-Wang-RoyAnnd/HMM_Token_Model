this is such a great film! never mind the low rating here. i really have no idea where that came from, they must be discussing a different film then. because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure. <br /><br />it's story was so original and charming.. i really can't think of anything bad to say about it. maybe it has to be ''your type of thing'', but, i saw this with my sister and my mother, and we all were taken by it. <br /><br />the acting was also very good, and that is hard to do in a film like this. but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic. <br /><br />i've always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new ''dark'' role very interesting. it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy, but i absolutely had no problem with that this time. even more so, i adored him. <br /><br />everyone who loves a good thriller/drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film, no question about that! anyone wanting to see a film with 80% bloodshed, should go rent something else, though.. but i guess the title already kind of gives that away. this is a love story, not saw 3.<br /><br />i give this film 4 out of five stars!!! good job!!!<br /><br />xxx enjoy!
