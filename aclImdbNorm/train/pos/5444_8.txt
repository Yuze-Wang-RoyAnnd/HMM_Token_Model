class reunion is a very underated comedy gem. it's 1982 and the 1972 class of lizzie borden high return for there 10 year reunion, among them are the usual stereotypes, the hunk, babe, the fat guy & nerd etc, but the former students are in for a bumpy night, one of their classmates is walter baloer, the class wimp who was subject to a comedy prank by the rest of the class on graduation night and since then has been in a mental home, walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation,,,,<br /><br />despite the dark premise, this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gags & set pieces. to say too much more would spoil the film but if you enjoyed the naked gun & airplane movies you'll love this, & what other film offers a music cameo by chuck berry?. a great comedy which deserves a wider audience.
