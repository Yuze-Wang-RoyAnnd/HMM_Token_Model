featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid-solo, "seven pounds" races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (the pursuit of happiness), a flick which i also loved. remember gabriele muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high-profile. <br /><br />too bad i figured out will smith's scheme early on, i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawson's character is introduced as having an incurable heart-disease.<br /><br />however, i still think the writer/director made the right choice putting the bookends (bookends are the first and the last scene) in that way, it's the source of urgency and tension in the movie, finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith's and dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two.<br /><br />one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith's character could have a divine gift, and i understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones, yet at other times he could be harsh and scary, and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely. it's quite a versatile performance.<br /><br />lastly i can't forget to mention the crash scene re-enactment, which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music. put this on your list.
