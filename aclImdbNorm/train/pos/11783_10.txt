rock star: inxs was the best music tv series i have ever watched! it had some of the greatest rock n' roll songs ever written, performed by 15 very talented singers/performers. it also had (in my opinion) the most heart-felt, feel-good, surprise endings in all of reality tv. it actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner!!! over the 13 weeks of this televised competition, the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants. after 30-some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality tv show. and the fact that inxs was, and still is, one of the greatest rock n' roll bands ever just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series. if you don't have the series recorded, rock star: inxs the dvd is a great alternative.
