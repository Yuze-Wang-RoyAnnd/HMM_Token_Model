a very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of boston and fenway park. as a baseball fan and light movie addict, it hit a homerun for me. plenty of laughs and plenty of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to past bosox failures. and how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an overage, over-the-hill, self-serving kevin costner attempting to make believers out of a critical audience? jimmy and drew did a fine job as a young love-struck couple suffering from jimmy's bosox "jones". it was a bit whacky and out of left field, but there really are sox fans that are that fanatic and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team. the movie coasted along at a fast pace and the ending, although predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies, without being overly pretentious. <br /><br />also enjoyable was the return of willie garson to the screen. i miss the forever-popular "stanford blatch" from sex & the city. he's always funny, even when he does or says very little. <br /><br />so buy yourself two box seats, some popcorn, and get ready for a fun time. "fever pitch" is a winner.
