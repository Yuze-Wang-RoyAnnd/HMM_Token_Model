question: how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full, furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode? answer: quietly, deadpan, and with perfect timing as george burns does here.<br /><br />i know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film, the two leads are hilarious, the script funny, the direction and pacing very fine. richard benjamin is very funny as straight man - trying to get at burns through the window etc. even the small parts are great.<br /><br />there are so many funny scenes, mathau messing up the commercial, burns repeating his answers as if senile...<br /><br />a delight.<br /><br />enterrrrrr!
