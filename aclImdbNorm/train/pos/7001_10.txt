i have never commented on a film before. i watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. i've read comments saying this movie stays with you. it does. it's been almost 24 hours and i am still completely affected. this movie left me questioning my own self. how can i possibly compare myself to a character such as ben who is totally selfless. i loved this movie. i love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end. i feel two emotions predominantly, happiness and sadness. an amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too. i so wanted ben and emily to be together, but in the end, they were, forever. if you haven't seen this movie, get it and watch it. just make sure you have no distractions. you'll want to see every nuance in this picture. one for my library.
