first of all i need to say that i'm portuguese and it's not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies, probably one each year or even none...<br /><br />...and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful, really close to the worst ever made! however, in the last decade, it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when "le~ao da estrela" e "costa do castelo" were among the worlds best of their time, with movies like "pulsac~ao zero" or "sorte nula", both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in common.<br /><br />this one is also good, not of the same kind because it isn't a true comedy; in fact it's officially a drama, a woman's drama the has some unexpected funny parts, cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them, like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid. <br /><br />the plot works and can surprise us a few times; the actors are fine, the locations regular as the score; but the truth is that it all make sense, then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema, that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix.<br /><br />if you want to watch a portuguese movie, surely you can take better option, but it stills one to be measured.
