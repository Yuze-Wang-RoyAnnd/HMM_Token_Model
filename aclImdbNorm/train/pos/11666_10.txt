the secret of kells may be the most exquisite film i have seen since the triplets of belleville. although stylistically very different, kells shares with triplets and (the jaw-dropping opening 2d sequence of) kung fu panda, incredible art direction, production design, background/layout and a richness in color that is a feast for one's senses. kells is so lavish -- almost gothic in its layout (somewhat reminiscent of klimt), wonderfully flat in general overall perspective, ornate in its celtic & illuminated design, yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing -- and it all works together beautifully. you fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. you are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil & brush. what tomm, nora, ross, paul and all at cartoon saloon (& their extended crews) have achieved with this small budget/very small crewed film, is absolutely astounding. the groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal. this film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire. congratulations to kells on its many accolades, its annie nomination as well as its current oscar qualifying run. they are all very well-deserved nods, indeed...
