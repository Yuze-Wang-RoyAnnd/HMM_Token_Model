the bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for super-spy jason bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. the bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is "universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.<br /><br />first, i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to ultimatum. there may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like i was. you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.<br /><br />if you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy. jason bourne is played very well by matt
