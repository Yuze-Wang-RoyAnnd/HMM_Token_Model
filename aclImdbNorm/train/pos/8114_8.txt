if scientists behaved in a way that h.g. wells was confident they would in the future, history wouldn't quite have turned out the way it did in things to come. were almost 80 years past the point that wells wrote the shape of things to come on which this film is based and no closer to the world he describes than before, in some ways farther away.<br /><br />though such well known players as raymond massey, ralph richardson, and cedric hardwicke are in the cast, they're more caricatures than real characters. it's the main weakness with the film, it's devoted to wells's philosophy of science will solve all problems and the rest of us are backward fools.<br /><br />massey's characters, two generations of the same family holds that supremely optimistic view. cedric hardwicke is a skeptic who feels man is rushing too far forward. and ralph richardson is a warlord arisen from the destruction of another thirty years war fought with modern weapons. by the way as the atomic bomb had not been invented, poison gas was deemed to be weapon that almost destroys mankind.<br /><br />according to wells, science and conquest can never mix. scientists as a group are far too above the world of politics to engage in such things. in wells's lifetime scientists certainly fled the rightwing fascistic governments of hitler and mussolini. those same folks however in order to defeat them, subordinated themselves to the allies and fashioned the atomic weapons that ushered in the modern age. if they behaved as wells would have liked them to, someone like albert einstein would have headed a junta of scientists who would have established a new order after world war ii. <br /><br />wells got it wrong both in time and in development. he apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power. computer programmers are far more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment. still things to come, aided by the direction of william cameron menzies and the sets created offer an interesting glimpse into the mind of h.g. wells, certainly a respected thinker of his time though he didn't quite get right the shape of things to come.
