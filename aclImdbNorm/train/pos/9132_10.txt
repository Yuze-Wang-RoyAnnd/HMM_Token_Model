i'll start by relating my first encounter with prince's music. it was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare breasted to "1999" playing on the speakers. i asked people, who is this singer? i was told it was prince. it was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful, topless dancer. later i started hearing other prince songs and really "digging" them. when purple rain came out i still knew very little about this fellow minnesotan. the movie blew me away. i instantly became prince's no. 1 fan of the "war baby" generation. later i found out one of my cousins was his secretary, and she got me, and my nephew into a v.i.p. prince concert where we sat next to his mother...how cool is that! getting back to the topic at hand, i agree with siskel & ebert who called purple rain an instant classic. i have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it. i thought prince's acting was fine, apollonia struggled a bit, but all in all the acting was fine. john gielgud was not available to play 'the kid' so prince took the role. the film is visually stunning, brilliantly paced (it never gets slow), and terrifically directed. i rank it among the best movie musicals of all time. the last time i watched it was after about a 7 year gap and it still delivered. i am so proud of fellow minnesotan prince rogers nelson and would love to tell him personally. he walked right in front of me during the above mentioned concert and said, "hi", to my nephew but not me. he was chatting with his mom. i was a bit crushed but he's still no. 1 with me.
