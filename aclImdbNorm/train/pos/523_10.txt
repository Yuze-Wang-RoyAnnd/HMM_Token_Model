why is this movie not in the 250 best? this movie looks still astoundingly fresh 56 years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of w.w.ii because of the perception of the nearness of death. people were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment. and what after life? i liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered. the phlegmatic judge (abraham sofaer-a typical british judge-), doctor reeves (roger livesey) defending peter carter (david niven) and also june (kim hunter) against the american prosecutor abraham farlan (raymond massey i -there is a reason why it is an american-). it is all so imaginative! michael powell wrote, directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real "tour-de-force". the message of the movie is clear: in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans. the way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any hollywood-movie could ever make.
