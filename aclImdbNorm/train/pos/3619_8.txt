despite disney's best efforts, this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams. i was surprised that it didn't strike me as over-sentimental; this movie played fair. dennis quaid was very, very good in the role, which is saying something for a sports movie. i can't recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me; here, everybody looks the part. this movie is surprisingly good, and i predict that it will do surprising business as it is a g-rated movie that doesn't require the viewer to stop thinking. ebert to the contrary, this movie is a success.
