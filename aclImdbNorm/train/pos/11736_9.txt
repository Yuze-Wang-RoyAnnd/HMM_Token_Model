those who are not familiar with cassandra peterson's alter-ego elvira, then this is a good place to start.<br /><br />"elvira, mistress of the dark" starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message. it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will. anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas, she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money.<br /><br />unfortunately, the place she has to go is the town of fallwell, massachusetts. having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down, she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. the town residents have mixed reactions:the teens like her, the women hate her, and the men lust after her (although trying to remain moral pillars of the community). her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent (w. morgan sheppard), because he wants her cookbook. seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock.<br /><br />the film is actually pretty funny, with peterson a.k.a. elvira using her "endowments" and sexiness as a joke ("and don't forget, tomorrow we're showing the head with two things... i mean the thing with two heads"). especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah, the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line, but ends up looking ridiculous (the picnic scene is the perfect example). deserves a peek (the film, not her boobs, of course).
