this movie is just too funny, a totally non-pc gangster romp. if mel brooks made a picture about the mob in the 30's, it would probably look like this. too many great one-liners to to remember, and while its not for everyone, anyone who doesnt laugh a whole bunch of times doesnt have a pulse. so, put it on and laugh you iceholes!!!
