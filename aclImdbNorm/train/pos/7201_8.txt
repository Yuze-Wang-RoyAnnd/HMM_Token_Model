very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas. can't say much about this film without giving away the story. i can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture. everybody has his or her own agenda. nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. well written with good performances by all.
