loved it! what's not to like?--you got your suburbia, you got your zombies, you got your family issues, you got your social dilemmas, you got yourself one fine retro-1950's-style flesh eating under class held at bay by an uneasy worried about whether they're the next meal upper crust. you couldn't ask for more.<br /><br />cast is superb. carrie ann moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife. she's both wanton, and criminally conspiratorial. every fellow's dream. k'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow succeeding. he's a genuine screen presence. very photogenic, and natural. without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. henry czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona. billy connolly is delightful as fido. a fine actor: i wish that he had played the title role in "braveheart," with gibson directing. my sense is that his william wallace would have been closer to the actual character. his fido is contained, yet accessible. a nice touch.<br /><br />in short, a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals, values, social pinnings, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times, and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions. a true reality show.
