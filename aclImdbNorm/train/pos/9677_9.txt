this movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids. the movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level. i watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny, entertaining,and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years. i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining. this movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life. this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right. i recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
