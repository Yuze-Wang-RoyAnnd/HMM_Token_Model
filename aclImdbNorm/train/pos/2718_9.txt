last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made - capote and infamous.<br /><br />i cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967. a stark, powerful and chillingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks (elmer gantry, cat on a hot tin roof, the professional, blackboard jungle).<br /><br />it is interesting that robert blake, who starred in this film, has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film.<br /><br />this is a film that stays with you after viewing.
