(you'll know what i mean after you've seen red eye...) <br /><br />overall, red eye was a better-than-expected thriller. it gets off to a slow start, and slowly builds. but by the time it was over, it's a thumper! <br /><br />it's hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as... thrilling as i found it. except that, simply put, the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run-of-the-mill plot. i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie. that says a lot.<br /><br />other factors, i think, are the "closeness" of victim and bad guy... and that over time, you begin to really relate to the victim. a scant 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5... but that's pretty good!
