as anyone old enough knows, south africa long suffered under the vile, racist oppression of apartheid, which completely subjugated the black population. one of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was steve biko, who was murdered in jail. following the murder, reporter donald woods sought to get biko's message out to the world.<br /><br />in "cry freedom", woods (kevin kline) befriends biko (denzel washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. when woods attempts to spread biko's word, he and his family begin living under threat of attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country. the last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters.<br /><br />as one of two movies (along with "a world apart") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "cry freedom" stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved.
