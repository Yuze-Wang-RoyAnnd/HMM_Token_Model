some have compared this film to deliverance. i believe of mice and men is more appropriate. our leading man, heaton, definitely loves spike. it is irrelevant and immaterial whether that is a sexual love. it is the reason heaton does not leave spike. he needs him. they need each other. as brothers, as family, as their only connection to humanity. the setting, scenario, minimal cast all add up to a fine film. frankly, i did not care what happened to the characters. but, i did care about what the film maker did with them. he did well with them. i spent some time wondering how the ending would resemble of mice and men. the soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing.
