very good point there : "only an elite few (the upper classes) would both have access to the internet and be able to communicate on an exclusively english speaking site such as the imdb" some might think internet is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake: you are probably right.. even if there is internet cafe's in venezuela most chavez supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on imdb.<br /><br />screw you faschist upper class rich right wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressors .. probably this is your first time using internet ;)..
