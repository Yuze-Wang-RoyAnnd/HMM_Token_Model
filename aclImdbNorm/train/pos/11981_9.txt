"full house," in my opinion, is an absolute abc classic! i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode, but i still enjoyed it. one of my favorite episodes is where jesse (john stamos) and rebecca (lori loughlin) get married. if you want to know how what made it so funny, you'd have to have seen it for yourself. it was a two-parter, so you'd have to have seen both parts. another one of my favorite episodes is where jesse, stephanie (jodie sweetin), and michelle (mary kate & ashley olsen) get locked in a gas station on michelle's birthday. you'd also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened. i have many other ones that i like, too. everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, even though it can be seen in syndication now, i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.
