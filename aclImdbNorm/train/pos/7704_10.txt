certain elements of this film are dated, of course. an all white male crew, for instance. and like most pre-star wars science fiction, it tends to take too long admiring itself.<br /><br />but, still, no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did, even down to the use of the "electronic tonalities" to provide the musical score. robbie the robot epitomized the asimov robots, and was the inspiration for all that followed, from c3po to data.<br /><br />the plot line, of course, is shakespeare's "the tempest". morbius is prospero, and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers... it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
