to say this film is simply a demonisation of catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue. that is not what this film is.<br /><br />what this film is is a comment on the abuses of the church (although this could be substituted for any powerful body), the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves. the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon. to label this as propaganda against catholics seems to miss the truth about what the catholic church has done at times; its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted. yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this film.<br /><br />it is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching - 'if we do not study the past, we are bound to repeat it'
