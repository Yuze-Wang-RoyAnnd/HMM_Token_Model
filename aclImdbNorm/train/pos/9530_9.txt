conrad hall went out with a bang. the great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on. he did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you'll ever see.<br /><br />of course, the acting ain't bad when you have tom hanks and paul newman playing the leads! the amount of action in here is just right, too: not too much; not too little.<br /><br />none of the characters in here, frankly, are "good guys" as hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss newman. hanks' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him, although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies! huh?<br /><br />as good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is cinematographer hall, who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens. his work is just awesome.
