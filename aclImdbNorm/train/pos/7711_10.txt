okay, so robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. and don't get me started about the poster.<br /><br />this is still a great movie, 40 years after it was released. i grew up watching "science fiction" on the local tv station's "science fiction/adventure theater" on sunday afternoons, so i've seen quite a few sf movies from the '50s. at a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, forbidden planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.<br /><br />i doubt that many sf movies made in the '90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030.
