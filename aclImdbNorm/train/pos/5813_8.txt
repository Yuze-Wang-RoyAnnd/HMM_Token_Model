this movie is great.<br /><br />now, i do tend to like my films heavy on the story and dialogue, but now and then, something like moonwalker comes along, and it's watchable, despite numerous flaws.<br /><br />this film is no more than a highly entertaining michael jackson advertisement. beginning with sickly video set to 'man in the mirror' a montage listing his achievements, and bits and bobs from his career, it goes through all the highs of his life, then crashes down into a really, really entertaining segment which acts as a funny music video for 'bad' and 'speed demon', following the adventures of mj as he runs from manic stop-motion fans, and finally dancing against a rabbit costume. the stop motion isn't that bad as some would have you believe. it's passable.<br /><br />then we see the great video for 'leave me alone', and straight into the main feature.<br /><br />yes, the plot is laughable. very laughable. we see michael walk out of a building, then get shot at by thousands of troops. then we hit flashback, showing mj and three children stumbling upon an underground lair. 'mr big' (joe pesci) is the nefarious villain who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on 'drugs' (no specifics are mentioned) at an early age. mj and the little girl he is with get caught, then chased... yada yada yada. the plot isn't really the important part. we get two very cool sequences where mj turns into a car, then a robot-spaceship thing, and of course, the amazing 'smooth criminal' sequence.<br /><br />it's a so-so film, but it is fantastic for anyone who likes mj. it has most of his greatest hits, and some cool little bits, and some quite good special effects (the robot/spaceship sequence in particular) worth it, especially seen as though you can pick it up for about a quid on ebay. it'll keep the kids quiet for a couple of hours, as well as most 20 somethings who were kids when it was first released.
