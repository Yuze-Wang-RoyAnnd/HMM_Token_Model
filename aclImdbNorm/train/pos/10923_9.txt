this movie is really good. the plot, which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle. fighting scenes are very good. there's a lot of different combat styles (although one of styles was a bit unreal for me, but it's only my opinion) to watch and it's fascinating show. the only thing which may be irritating is actors look. a bit too effeminate (at least for me). hong kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's, so "five venoms" (or other its versions) is great choice.
