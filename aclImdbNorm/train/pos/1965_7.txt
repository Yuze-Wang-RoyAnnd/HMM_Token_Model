i found this movie to be very good in all areas. the acting was brilliant from all characters, especially ms.stone and morissey. tramell's character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute. the plot is interesting even though, this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels. the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious,thriller like masterpiece. go see this film now , it deserves better than what it got from the audience ,which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie(before it even started).....you won't regret it,if you go see it...
