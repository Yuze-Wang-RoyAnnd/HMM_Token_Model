i watched this tape, immediately rewound it, watched it again and laughed twice as hard. i strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of, but uncomfortable around transvestites. it shows you that transvestitism is a feature, rather than the entirety of one's being. the comedy is not single issue. this man is brilliant. all comics should aspire to his level of candor, intelligence and talent.
