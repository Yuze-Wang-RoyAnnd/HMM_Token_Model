i happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon. i have to admit that i've never been a big baseball fan, but i can sometimes get into a good sports-related movie. what i found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system. as a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system, i though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system: people jumping from family to family, biological parents not always taking an active involvement, and transitions that can be but heart-wrenching and heart-melting. joseph gordon-levitt and danny glover are the anchor of this film, and both bring very believable performances. maybe it was just my emotional state, but i did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film.
