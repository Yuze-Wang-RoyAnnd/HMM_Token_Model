this is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. and, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, a yank at oxford. both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency. in this film, william haines is "tom brown" and his main rival, "bob" is played by frances x. bushman. and, in a supporting role is jack pickford--always remembered as the brother of mary. of these three, pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom's pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game! all the standard clich'es are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. however, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing.<br /><br />in my opinion, for a better silent college film, try harold lloyd's the freshman--it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown. the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era. another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again (such as in westpoint and the smart set, among others)--and if you've seen one of these films, you've seen them all. well made, but certainly not original! and, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films.<br /><br />4/25/08==i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920!! talk about over-rated! there are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone's guess.
