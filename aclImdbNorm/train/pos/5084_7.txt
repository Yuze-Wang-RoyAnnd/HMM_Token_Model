i was surprised, that ''the secret fury'' was an enjoyable good film...... probably because, i didn't have any expectations for this movie..... though, the film does have it's plot holes..... i would say, that you couldn't guess who was behind the whole scheme, until the very end of the movie..... at first, i thought, it was robert ryan, using the same method, like ''gaslight'' where husband tries to drive his wife mad, but i was wrong...... the main problem, with the movie is, they drive at a whole other direction, which gave no clues at the beginning...... i thought, robert ryan & claudette colbert carried their parts well...... plus, vivian vance, a fine character actress, who steals scenes in this one...... those who like movies, that keeps you guessing, will like this one......
