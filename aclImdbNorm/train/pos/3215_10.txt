this was excellent. touching, action-packed, and perfect for kurt russel. i loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. this movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering, and people who learn that there is a time for fighting, a need to defend. i cried, laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story. good writing job for an action flick, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. the ending wasn't twisty, but it was still excellent. if you like escape from new york, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you. not an undue amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that respect. something for everyone.
