the combination of the superb black and white photography and the 'eugene onegin with a twist' plot made this a real knock out for me. the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping. there was a superb moment where where transparencies - apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly - were shown accompanied by lensky's heart-wrenching aria from the tschaikowsky opera eugene onegin.<br /><br />for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium, which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film. krisana is in the same mould.
