this is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was. i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid. it doesn't help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown's graveyard when i was ten. turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan. so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile, but i love it now, as a 24 year old.<br /><br />i bought this dvd used for 6 bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover, but to my surprise, it ruled. it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal. and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd. this movie is awesome, if you love 80s metal and bad movies, this one's for you. 9/10!
