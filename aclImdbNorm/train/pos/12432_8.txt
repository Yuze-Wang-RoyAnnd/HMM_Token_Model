i was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie, which is why i left it unwatched for so long, but i was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails, with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized.<br /><br />it's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that: less time and effort was spent on finding ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die, and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching. hell, the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise, that adds to the suspense -- who's winning? who's dying?<br /><br />alexandra staden might not be as drop-dead gorgeous as monica vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face, her hair, and her tall, slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic-strip graphics.<br /><br />nikolaj coaster-waldau was the perfect choice for a blaise bad-guy, in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable (and i doubt i'd consider taking on many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies). i can't think of a single one of hollywood's "former waiters" who could have pulled the role off that well.<br /><br />fortunately, blaise baddies always die, in the end (no spoilers there!) that's a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes.
