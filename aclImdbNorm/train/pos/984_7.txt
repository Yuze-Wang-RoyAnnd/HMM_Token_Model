i happened across "bait" on cable one night just as it started and thought, "eh, why not?" i'm glad i gave it a chance. <br /><br />"bait" ain't perfect. it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness. but overall, this movie worked. all the elements aligned just right, and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film. <br /><br />most of that, i think, is due to jamie foxx. i don't know who tagged foxx for the lead, but whoever it was did this movie a big favor. believable and amazingly likeable, foxx glides through the movie, smooth as butter and funnier than hell. you can tell he's working on instinct, and instinct doesn't fail him.<br /><br />the plot, while unimportant, actually ties together pretty well, and there's even a character arc through which foxx's character grows as a person. again, they could've slipped by without any of this, but it just makes things that much better.<br /><br />i'm surprised at the low rating for this. maybe i just caught this move on the right night, or vice versa, but i'd give it a 7/10. bravo, mssr. foxx.
