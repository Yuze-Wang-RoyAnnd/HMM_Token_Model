"read my lips" tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain, socially maladroit female office worker (devos) and her workplace trainee, a crude excon (casel). as the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome. good stuff for anyone into character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation. (b+)
