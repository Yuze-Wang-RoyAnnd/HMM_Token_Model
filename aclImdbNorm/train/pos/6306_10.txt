idiotic hack crooks, a babe, a safe, a plan and a baby. add them all up and you get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /><br />even with some a-list star power (at least a-minus...okay, b-plus?) this movie got very little publicity.<br /><br />but that does not diminish its genius.<br /><br />terrific writing, solid delivery and a believable group of characters. some truly classic lines, and a fun twist at the end.<br /><br />this is not some watered-down "nutty professor" comedy. these are low-life bad guys. they speak low-life bad guy language and they do low-life bad guy things. but they do it for your amusement and entertainment, and they do that well.<br /><br />one of the best comedies i've ever seen.
