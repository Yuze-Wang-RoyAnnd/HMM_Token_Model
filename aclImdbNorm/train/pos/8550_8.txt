now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for seann william scott's performance as stifler but after that the quality has dropped. band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot- lines recycled (erik stifler's sex problem is like jim's). it had some amusing moments like the football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'mile' was just stupid and moronic. not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex. <br /><br />anyway enough about the naked mile. i watched beta house with apprehension as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised. to be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls (ashley is incredible) and sex jokes aplenty. yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight stifler (steve talley) raises the bar with an exuberant performance. the greek olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while christopher mcdonald's cameo is hilarious. there are weak points though. coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first, i'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part. <br /><br />while coozeman is bad erik stifler is worse. john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in beta house he takes his performance to a whole new low. first and foremost he lacks charisma, a stifler prerequisite. you really can't care less about him. the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen! she shines above him as does the rest of the cast. seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /><br />saying that the film does entertain and coozeman's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny. <br /><br />overall this film is worth renting, get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit-fest event and vent your anger at erik 'loser' stifler.
