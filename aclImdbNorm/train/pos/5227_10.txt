the "men in white" movie is definitely one of the funniest, if not the funniest, comedy movies i ever watched! (and i watched quite a lot!) it is about two garbagemen, who become "men in white" and then stop an invasion from space. it is also a parody of lots of classic movies, such as "men in black", "star wars" or "dr. strangelove". anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head. there are tons of funny gags and jokes here, and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard (it happened to me!). if you can watch this movie on tv, watch it now - you certainly won't regret it!
