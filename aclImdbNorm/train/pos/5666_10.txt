i loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when i found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasn't worthy of being continued! for years i hung onto my copies of this show, ones that i had taped or had someone tape for me. that is until now. the powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on dvd and i finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set. which, brings me to this part; the part about that this show is all about.<br /><br />american gothic is about good verses evil, basically a struggle between lucas buck (that is buck, with a b). he is an evil sheriff of a south carolina small town that runs things the way he wants things to be ran and stops at nothing to get his way.<br /><br />i felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had lots of life left yet to be lived. i really hated when it was canceled, but that is the way it seems to go for me when i finally find something worth watching on television.<br /><br />gary cole did a great job as the role of sheriff lucas buck, he has just the right amount of charm verses evil to pull it off. the other actors did a super job as well, so i guess you could say, even the casting was a hit with me.
