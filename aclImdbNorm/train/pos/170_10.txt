don't listen to fuddy-duddy critics on this one, this is a gem! young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies - and now they have to work for a living! she, naturally, becomes a reporter, and he, just as naturally, a driver for the mob! by wild co-incidences their careers meet head on, thanks to gangster clark gable. in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam-shovel).<br /><br />but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - it's all good fun from those wonderful pre-code days, when hollywood was really naughty. joan looks great, and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity (thank god she stopped the dancing!). gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he wasn't a star yet and so didn't have to be the hero. great to see him playing something different. and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother. and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont, who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience! great fun!
