burlinson and thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie, along with dennehy. although it is at first thought to be only about love, it really goes down deeper than that. the beauty of nature captures this movie, placing among one of the best i have ever seen. the horse scenes are absolutely fantastic!! any horse-lovers out there will love this movie!<br /><br />
