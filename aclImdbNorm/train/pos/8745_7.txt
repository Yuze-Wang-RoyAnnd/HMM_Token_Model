after high-school graduation, best friends alice and darlene, decide to take a trip to thailand. whilst they are there, they meet a charming australian guy named nick. after spending some time with nick, he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to hong kong with him. they agree. at the airport though, they are get busted for smuggling drugs and then get convicted for 33 years in a thai prison for something they say they haven't done. not really knowing what to do they end contacting yankee hank, an american lawyer who lives in thailand with his wife. word has it that if you have the money he can help you. things start of well, but they still can't get out.<br /><br />the movie is really good because it doesn't let on what's going to happen and it's interesting all the time. i couldn't believe the ending though. it was one of those endings where you don't know the 100% truth, but you still kind of know what really happened with nick and the drug smuggling because of the 'owning up' etc. <br /><br />claire danes and kate beckinsale both give quite good performances here. beckinsales performance was a little weak though. both danes and beckinsales characters friendship is good but could of seemed stronger. paul walker even has a small uncredited role here. ;)<br /><br />anyway, i thought brokedown palace was a good movie and i give it a 7/10.
