bette davis turns in a coldly amusing performance as mildred rogers in this 1934 film. the film seems rather dated now in 2003. it is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and bette davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today. it was startling for me to see how young ms. davis looks in this move. the actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting. leslie howard is well cast as philip carey, the club-footed medical student. this is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why. however, "of human bondage" didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally. i felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it. i have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for. you be the judge!<br /><br />
