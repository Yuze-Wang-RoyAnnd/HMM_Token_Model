a delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way. cinema after all is a visual media and igor used its full potential. a young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind. in one of the compartments he meets with a girl. words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations. the two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words.
