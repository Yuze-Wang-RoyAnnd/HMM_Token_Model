embarrassingly, i just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. it's a story that any father or brother can relate to... one brother is a bit 'wild,' the other brother is the typical older child. craig sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother, but pitt is amazing, and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father. the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking... i had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. the movie closely follows the book, with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format. unlike most book to movie stories, this one measures up. it's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie.
