ag was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv. sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the willies. we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas. we became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. the manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising. this show lived up to the "gothic" moniker in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted, much less mastered. the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. this show puts shame to the current glut of "reality" shows- which are so less than satisfying viewing.the call for a dvd box set is well based. this show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. a public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling. bring on the dvd box set!!
