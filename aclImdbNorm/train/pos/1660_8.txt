i'm fan of art, i like anything about art, i like paintings, sculptures, etc. this movie shows it, so i like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to paint anything about art, especially naked bodies, but she can't do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the movie she painted herself naked, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family didn't let her paint naked men because it's against the moral. even so artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. she falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems the art teacher is absolutely in love with her too, so at the ending he sacrifices his freedom for hers by lying. he said that he raped her, but it wasn't true. artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says that she will suffer a lot, because in the trial in which artemisia, her father and the art teacher were, somebody was hurting her artistic hands to say the truth. i think this a great movie about art, and an artistic love, it's worth watching. valentina cervi is great as artemisia, she acts very well, i also like her performance in "the portrait of a lady" as pansy osmond. 8.5/10
