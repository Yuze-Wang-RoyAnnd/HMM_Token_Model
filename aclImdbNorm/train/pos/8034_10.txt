there are few movies that appear to provide enterntainment as well as realism. if you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war, take a look at this one. <br /><br />i just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle, no-one quite sure where that shot came?<br /><br />and, they nicked one scene to saving private ryan, so it has to have some merit in the scene.<br /><br />
