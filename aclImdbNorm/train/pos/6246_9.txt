it's not a brilliant idea to watch hundstage if you're not 100% sure of your mental stability, because it will be severely tested with this film no matter how sane you are. i have to say hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film, so the majority of the viewers wouldn't have the level of "maturity" to reach in to its delightful side. kind of like tarkovsky films, but different in a way. i, myself, can't say i had a lot of fun watching it. but it's an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the clich'e that hollywood offers. hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over. you can't simply sit back and watch it, you'll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film. a film that's similar to this in style is nachtgestalten, but it was considerably better, and way less violent. this one for instance, is not for children or those who are mentally tender or bad-tempered. most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film. i give it a 9 because i've seen the multiple-stories-in-one-film phenomenon in another film and it was better. but this one's an outstanding piece on its own. worth watching, but get ready to see something disturbing.
