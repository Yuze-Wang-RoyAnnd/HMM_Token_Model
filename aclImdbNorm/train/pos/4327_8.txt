i like this presentation - i have read bleak house and i know it is so difficult to present the entire book as it should be, and even others like little dorrit - i have to admit they did a very good show with the staged nicholas nickelby. i love diana rigg and i could see the pain of lady dedlock, even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. i am sorry, i think she is the best lady dedlock... i am not sure who could have made a better jarndyce, but i am ok with mr. elliott. it is not easy to present these long dickens' books - oliver twist would be easier - this is a long, and if you don't care for all the legal situations can be dreary or boring. i think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring. i just loved mr. smallweed - it can be entertaining. there is always a child - jo will break your heart here... i think we should be given a chance to judge for ourselves...<br /><br />i have to say i loved the show. maybe if i read the book again, as i usually do, after seeing the movie, maybe i can be more critical. in the meantime - i think it is a good presentation.
