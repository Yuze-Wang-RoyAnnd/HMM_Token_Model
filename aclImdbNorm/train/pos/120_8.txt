it is not every film's job to stimulate you superficially. i will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day. while this really can't be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again. this is a challenging, provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly. the problem with the movie is in its structure. its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up, just as a second ending is tacked on. though everything is technically dazzling, the movie is exactly too long by that unit. the long-delayed climax of leo's awakening comes about 20 minutes late.<br /><br />great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script, but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging; a character is rear-projected but his own hand in the foreground isn't. the world depicted is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. keep your eyes peeled for a memorable, technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop.<br /><br />the compositions are stunning. whomever chose to release the (out of print) videotape in the pan & scan format must have never seen it. where is the dvd?<br /><br />it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review. you should see it at least once. you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew, but this movie ends up being richer for it. i suspect he is familiar with hitchcock's foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does. all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies. after zentropa, von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary, over-rated, un-nuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark.
