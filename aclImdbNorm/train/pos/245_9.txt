the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom. simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. it's not bad, but it's really not very good. the editing is good; the film is well-paced. the direction is competent and assured. the story is plodding. the film is averagely acted by ledger, bloom, and the normally great watts and rush. the accents are impenetrable if you're from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as i like to call it, orlando bloom). by the end of the film, i was neither bored nor moved. some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie. i have to say, i so did not care by that point.<br /><br />really, the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of, sort of shows some hints of range (although the oft-present "i'm pretty and confused" look is prominent), so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price. other than that, just don't see it. it's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining.
