this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing. we as a people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of "all talk and no action" and start to realise in order to make a change, there needs to be less talk and more action. it is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues, and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference... despite its reference to the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray.
