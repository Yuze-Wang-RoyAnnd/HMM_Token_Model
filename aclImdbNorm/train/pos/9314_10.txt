only saw this show a few times, but will live in my memory. <br /><br />it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like friends! especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i guess..?<br /><br />they say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the bakersfield pd themselves? maybe it was just too clever for certain people? <br /><br />anyhow, just about the one comedy i would love to see again but is almost impossible to find. i hear it is being or has been repeated on another network? but alas not over here!!<br /><br />summary: ingenious.
