i love all of the movies by michael landon jr. and michael landon jr's casting of dale midkiff as "clark davis"could not of been any better. dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this character.<br /><br />this movie kept me spellbound from start to finish.<br /><br />the death of missie & willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing. how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers love.<br /><br />although there are 3 movies before this one [ love comes softly , loves enduring promise & loves long journey], i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily. yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind them.<br /><br />michael landon jr. is an excellent director<br /><br />i look forward to many more movies from him in the future.
