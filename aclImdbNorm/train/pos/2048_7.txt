a brutally depressing script and some fine low-key performances by peter strauss and pamela reed and some good location shooting in ohio power this fine tv movie about hard times in the rustbelt. as the mills close and the union jobs disappear, the blue-collar workers are threatened by everyone: management, owners, their wives and children. strauss is completely believable in his role, and pamela reed is, as always, wonderful. see if you can recognize john goodman before he put on weight.<br /><br />the heavy metal score -- was someone making a pun? -- is, at times, obtrusively annoying, but the cinematography by frank stanley is knockout, particularly the mill scenes.
