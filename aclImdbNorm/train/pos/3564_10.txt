{possible spoilers coming up... you've been forewarned.}<br /><br />this is absolutely one of my all time favorite musicals and movie musicals! (the other is damn yankees with gwen verdon, tab hunter and ray walston) as we all know, sometimes the luster (not to mention the songs) of a show are lost in its transition from stage to screen. this is, for the most part, definitely not the case here.<br /><br />the sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can't help but love them, and michael kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (so glad to know they used the original broadway choreographer)<br /><br />all of the actors "bounce the ball" (that is, have unbeatable chemistry) to perfection in this film. frank and marlon are absolutely believable as the proprietor of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in new york, and the most notorious gambler who bets on even the most minute things-- such as his fever going up to 104 if he doesn't take penicillin. sweet, fresh faced jean simmons is perfect for the role of sarah (although it is true, her singing pipes are not as outstanding as that of isabel bigley or josie de guzman)-- the mission doll with a heart of gold and a drive to heal all. and last but certainly not least (on my list anyway) is miss vivian blaine, reprising her broadway role as miss adelaide-- the hot box lead singer and dancer who would like to finally end her 14 year engagement to nathan with marriage, and rid herself of the psychosomatic cold he's given her.<br /><br />first off, kudos to stubby kaye and b.s. pulley as they reprise their broadway roles as nicely-nicely johnson and benny southstreet. there were never two more loveable gamblers than these guys.<br /><br />brando is superb, as usual, and though he's not got the voice of robert alda or peter gallagher, you forget it-- as he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role as sky masterson. "luck be a lady" gives me chills every time i see him perform the number. especially enjoyable is hearing him say "daddy... i got cider in my ear."<br /><br />simmons is charming and pleasant in a role well suited to her looks, voice and the way she carries herself. you long so dearly for her not only to win sky (or, toward the end, believe him), but to help people overcome their gambling, drinking and other sins, and live a life with god. her rendition of "if i were a bell" is splendid, to say the least!<br /><br />sinatra is the man. he is so perfect for the role of nathan detroit-- and here he sings parts that sam levene from the broadway cast never could (terrific actor, but the chap was tone deaf... go figure). i really enjoyed the addition of the song "adelaide"... wish some guy would sing like that to me. frankie's cool, slick demeanor transcends the boundaries of this movie. but most importantly, you want him to marry adelaide.<br /><br />and speaking of adelaide, vivian blaine is just sheer perfection in this role. from the accent to her belting out "adelaide's lament", she's just terrific. and she's also my favorite part of the entire movie. she really makes you feel for adelaide... especially when she cries right before and then again during "sue me". i still haven't decided whether i like "pet me poppa" better than "bushel and a peck"... maybe i like them equally. either way, she does fantastic with those as well as "take back your mink." (i'm sad that they left out "hollanderize" from the film...) she's absolutely marvelous, not to mention hilarious, and my favorite part of the entire film.<br /><br />one of the best things about this movie is their lingo. it's a mixture of high class and street slang. never do they use "it's", "i'll" or "that's." it's always "it is", "i will" and "that is." overall, guys & dolls is one of my favorite all time movies and musicals, and it's one that you should take time to watch every time it comes on. my only complaint? no "marry the man today." now that's a good song.
