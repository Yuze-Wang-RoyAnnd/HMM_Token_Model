i found this movie thought-provoking, and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of quick-fix films where we are manipulated into loving the "good guy" and hating the "bad guy." scott cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a great job of portraying the family black sheep/lost child who aspires to gain his father's love and respect, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history. judd hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected.<br /><br />when i saw this at the tribeca film festival, i was enchanted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as explained by the director.<br /><br />this is a fitting successor to the classic "ordinary people." i just realized, judd hirsch was in that, too!
