this is a good movie, although people unfamiliar with the modesty blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action. for the modesty fan, the movie will be very enjoyable, particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the modesty blaise "history". peter o'donnell is listed in the credits as "creative consultant" and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years {although the events have been recast to modern days). the only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no willie garvin in the story. this lack of willie is again just being faithful to the modesty blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of modesty's career. alexandra staden makes a very believable young modesty who actually looks a lot like modesty is supposed to look. a welcome change from the travesty of the monica vitti portrayal of modesty.
