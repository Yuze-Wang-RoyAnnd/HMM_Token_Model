the number of times i've had tears in my eyes when watching a movie are few. and there is only one time when i have really cried and that was when i saw this movie. this movie has some kliches but i really don't care. i cry even as i write this and it was quite some time since i saw it. it is perfectly acted and all the production values are good, but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message. we all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all it's forms. it's only when we love that we're truly alive. i know how sentimental i sound and i promise i'm not usually like that. i'm quite a cynic. this movie has brought out stronger feelings of both sorrow and happiness in me than any other movies and it will probably always be the first movie i recommend others to see.
