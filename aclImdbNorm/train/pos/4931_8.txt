when plague breaks out in new orleans, it's richard widmark to the rescue in "panic in the streets," one of the lesser-celebrated films of the great elia kazan. kazan keeps the pace brisk, and there are lots of marvelous touches - the scenes between widmark and barbara bel geddes, who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens, which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low-lifes, portrayed by a menacing jack palance, his weak yes man, zero mostel, tommy cook, and louis charles. there are also some interesting visuals - palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height.<br /><br />the acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn't quite up to the direction and performances. it has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily. that aside, it's well worth viewing. kazan was a masterful director.
