anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. this is a fine movie that tells about tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death, but also grows up in the process. the journey on the train sort of represents tetsuro's journey from boyhood to manhood. the music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated (you can tell it's a 70's movie) and the animation is only slightly better than your average "star blazers" episode. but the story and the characters are so strong, it really doesn't matter. a must-see for any animation fan!
