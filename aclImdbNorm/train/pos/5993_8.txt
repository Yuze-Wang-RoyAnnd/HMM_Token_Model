the cure uses voice over to create an intense mood. although the vo accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story. the use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story. the choice of combining b & w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time. the ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result. i was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense. the close-ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye. the piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot. the tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do. worth watching more than once!
