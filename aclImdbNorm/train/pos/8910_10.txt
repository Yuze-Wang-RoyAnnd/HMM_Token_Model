most of the atomic age monster movies i saw on television as a kid- and some of them, the blob included, scared the daylights outta me. movies like invaders from mars made it all too clear to us "small fry" that kids just weren't to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the homeworld; the blob just reiterated that fact. i recall, fondly, late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as body snatchers and martian invaders and blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society. there was a summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in richmond, virginia) ran an atomic age classic every weekend. these were 16mm films, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the "color" print of the blob had faded to a faint pink- but, man, was it fun. i dragged my mother along, and she enjoyed it as much as i did. it was there, at that science museum, that i truly fell in love with the blob. the filmmaker's intent was, of course, to make money- but it was the sincerity of all involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (the players), that made me fall in love with this movie. corny? you bet. cheesy? they don't get any cheesier. but, man, what a movie!
