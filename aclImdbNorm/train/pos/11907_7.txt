hitchcock was of the opinion that audiences aren't really interested in what puts protagonists into danger - only that they are in danger, and need to escape.<br /><br />this film proves hitchcock was not 100% correct. police believe jean simmons is guilty of a crime, when she plainly isn't. trevor howard decides their best course of action is to run for it. and so, the body of the movie has our charismatic pair dodging on and off trains, buses and coaches - jumping across rocks at the top of a waterfall - scrambling across dockyard roofs.<br /><br />all good exciting stuff - but i couldn't get out of my mind that it was all unnecessary. they should have stayed put.<br /><br />in other words, the macguffin wasn't strong enough.
