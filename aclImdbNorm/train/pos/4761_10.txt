an excellent film with great performances from zack & lochley. much to their displeasure (& mine) garibaldi arrived on station. (all due respect to jerry doyle but in seasons 4 & 5 i lost sympathy for the character.) it doesn't take him long to start criticizing zack (who i love best of all on the show)and taking charge. i'm sure zack could have coped. the soulhunter plot is fascinating, especially if you believe in heaven as zack does. the humour supplements it nicely. 10/10
