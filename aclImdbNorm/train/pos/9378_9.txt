dahl seems to have been under the influence of wenders' the american friend. innocent nick cage gets recruited for a hit. dennis hopper plays a real hit man. lara flynn boyle is dangerous. the hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself. and small town america does not seem all that safer than the big city. like it's predecessor mentioned above, this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable, but all lead to the cathartic self discovery.
