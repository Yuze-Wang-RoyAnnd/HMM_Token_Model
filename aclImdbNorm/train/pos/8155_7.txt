i'm too old to know (or care) exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is. and, being canadian, it's likely that i've never actually seen mtv, but i'm not certain.<br /><br />but i thought this film was very funny when i saw it, a bright little satire. hip-hop culture is so pervasive these days that it's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over. (if only we could say the same about bagpipe music.) i got most of the jokes (at least i think i did). sure, it's derived from spinal tap, but there are lots of targets that could stand a tap treatment. just not the carpenters, they're sacred.
