most people, especially young people, may not understand this film. it looks like a story of loss, when it is actually a story about being alone. some people may never feel loneliness at this level.<br /><br />cheadles character johnson reflected the total opposite of sandlers character fineman. where johnson felt trapped by his blessings, fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective. jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pulls tears. cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for sandler.<br /><br />i see oscars somewhere here. a very fine film. if you have ever lost and felt alone, this film will assure you that you're not alone.<br /><br />jerry
