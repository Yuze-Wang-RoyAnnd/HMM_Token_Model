dan katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern israel.<br /><br />for anyone who's ever been in love, the film brings back the uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet. the atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling. instantly, you are drawn in to dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply moved.<br /><br />you can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of dan's desperate, snatched relationship with iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable. if you have an ounce of passion, and have ever been in love, see this film.
