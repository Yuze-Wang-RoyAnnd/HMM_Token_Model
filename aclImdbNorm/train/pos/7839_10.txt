panned by critics at the time but loved by the fans, this film has now become a classic. mixing supposedly 'surreal' footage shot at john lennon's home among other places with live footage of marc bolan & t.rex at their very best, this film is not just a must for everyone who's liked marc bolan but gives a fascinating insight into the era.<br /><br />these were the times when marc was hobnobbing with the likes of ringo starr of the beatles [who directed it] and you can even find a brief spot from one reg dwight [elton john to you] bashing the ivories in an amazing [and never officially released] version of tutti frutti and rocking and ballad versions of children of the revolution.<br /><br />there's also wonderful scenes featuring chelita secunda [said to have 'created glam rock' with her use of glitter etc], mickey finn and even the actor from catweazle!!<br /><br />the best scene for me is in the garden when marc leaves the dining table, sits down cross-legged in front of a string section and knocks out acoustic versions of classics such as get it on and the slider.<br /><br />highly, highly recommended!! five stars [out of five].<br /><br />rory
