lapyuta (castle in the sky), more than any of hayao miyazaki's movies, brings the joy of storytelling to the audience. it is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again; it's just magical. it's a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states, but now that it's here check it out! and stick with the original language; the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie (or book, whatever.)<br /><br />i give it a ten/ten.
