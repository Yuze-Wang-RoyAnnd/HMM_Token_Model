lensman is a rather lesser-known anime gem from toho and mk studios.it's loosely based on the novel,but it reminds me more of the game "metroid".<br /><br />if you want to see this,see it in japanese with subtitles or just plain japanese.the english dubbed version was almost cropped and edited to death.<br /><br />there is not much new,despite the fact that it's the 1st animated feature to combine cg-graphics with hand-drawn animation,but it's fun to watch,nevertheless.
