i saw soylent green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on t.v. or video. it was always one of my favorite sci-fi and/or charlton heston films.<br /><br />recently, the egyptian theater in l.a. had a twelve film charlton heston retrospective. i flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period. soylent green looked great on the large egyptian screen with a perfect new print. from its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic.<br /><br />charlton heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and eddie robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great.<br /><br />their chemistry together is wonderful. the film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print. fleisher really knows how to fill the screen,and the cinematoraphy, writing, music used, and everything about it works. the film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future. just think how the world population grew, the rain forest that disappeared, resources used up, green house effect getting worse since 1973. i just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years. its reputation should be better.<br /><br />speaking of reputations, often people speak as if charlton heston is not a great actor. seeing him in el-cid, soylent green, the warlord, the omega man, will penny, and major dundee back to back i am convinced he is one of our best actors. of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are.<br /><br />
