i think this is a lovely family movie. there are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart-warming moments to be had throughout the movie. the actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. danny glover plays george knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'the angels' and is great throughout the film. also fantastic are the young actors joseph gordon-levitt and milton davis jr. christopher lloyd is good as al 'the angel' and the effects are great in this top notch disney movie. a touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.
