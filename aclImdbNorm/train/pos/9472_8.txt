marie: you are smooth. dan: no, i'm not smooth. i'm dan.<br /><br />if you're anything like me, smooth and single do not go together. you see someone you like, rare enough as that can be, and you want to say something but you don't. or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you've ever said in your life. more often then not though, you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life
