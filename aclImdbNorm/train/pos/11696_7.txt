"a thief in the night" is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans at large due to its low-budget (which was obvious) and its subject matter--the rapture of true christian church and the fate of those left behind. nevertheless, it was a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with jesus christ. it touched everyone--showing even a pastor who preached the word, but did not believe it, knowing exactly why he was left behind. this movie, and its sequel "distant thunder," are must see movies. even with the new "left behind" series coming out, telling the same story with a much higher budget, the impact is still the same--"a thief in the night" broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.
