well, when before i saw this film i really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea...how wrong i was! i thought that this was one of the best films i've watched for a very long time, a real family classic. the story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster' dad, this film ticks all the boxes. i've not read the book (maybe that's a good thing & meant i enjoyed the film more) but with regards to the story, i really can't think of any bad points, hence scoring it 10 out of 10 (and i hardly ever think anything warrants top marks!). by the time william proclaimed 'i can ride my bike, dad!' i was sobbing my heart out (anyone who's seen it will understand, i'm sure). really heartwarming, and definitely recommended.
