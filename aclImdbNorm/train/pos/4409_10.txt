this movie is one of the sleepers of all time. i gave it a 10 rating. the story is of the famed 'bushwhackers' out of missouri that fought on the side of the south during the war between the states. the clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. there was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... but not bad for hollywood. the actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them. i suspect it was a combination of great directing, super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors. not just one or two... this movie really jelled! it has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. even has the future spiderman and jewel. and she's good!
