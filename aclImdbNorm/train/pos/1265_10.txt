hi.. i consider just cause one of my favorite sean connery's movies, it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the cast, especially connery..it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies, so the dialog is pretty good in this one.. it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever, when sean interviews ed harris's character in prison is just fantastic..i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough, really do not miss this one ! do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes suck, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, i really find just cause a very entertaining movie..
