being a fan of andy goldsworthy's art for a while now, and owning some of his books, i had some expectations of what i would see. what i got was something completely satisfying, and quite a bit more than i expected. being an artist myself (i work in clay), finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative, and it is something andy goldsworthy has mastered. following him over the course of a year, the director captures the spontaneous energy, skill, and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair. the music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating. if you are an artist in need of inspiration, or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience, then see this movie. i for one am glad to know that andy is somewhere out there. creating, dancing, wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
