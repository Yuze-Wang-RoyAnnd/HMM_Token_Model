i loved the the film. it beautifully analyzes italian petty bourgeois society, how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they don't want disturbed. for instance, the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son, and doesn't want to be reminded of his more radical youth.<br /><br />for a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on tv, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in italy no one in the book shops knew about the film. a great pity.<br /><br />the one sex scene, which everyone seems to go on about, does the film no harm.
