this is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy. it's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own. the cat is named sassy and she lives up to her name. chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound. shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things. put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time. there are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all. it's the best talking animal movie that i've seen so far. it's a really good movie for families.
