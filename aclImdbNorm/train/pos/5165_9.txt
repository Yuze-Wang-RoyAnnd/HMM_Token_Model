this ensemble piece about adults who return to the formulative summer camp of their youth was a very quiet entrant and exiter to the cinemas in the autumn of 1993. i'd say that was a shame,but then again,some of the better movies are quiet releases that don't get much hype or praise.<br /><br />diane lane,kevin pollack,elizabeth perkins,vincent spano,julie warner,bill paxton,kimberly williams,matt craven and alan arkin(who is painfully good here) are the group of actors who flesh out these roles as people who have grown old with good,bad and funny memories of summers gone past. this film covers the gambit of emotions,mostly pleasant,and the film never hammers away at the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling,preferring to allow the viewer to enter into the memories on their own. since i am a movie viewer who bristles at bluntly,brazen manipulation in films,this is something that i appreciate from writer/director mike binder.<br /><br />this film's a great cheap rent,a good main rent and even a pretty sit in a theater flick. you might run across this on tv,and i would definitely suggest a look-see.
