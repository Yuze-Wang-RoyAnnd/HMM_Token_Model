first, this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the "wonderland" dvd rental.<br /><br />the two movies included with the rental, "wonderland" and the johnny wadd documentary, totally obliterate the myth created by "boogie nights". that myth being that the characters involved in the adult movie trade were considerably more than slimy lowlifes that would do anything for money, basically denying that they were anything other than detestable self-centered whores. this is amazingly similar to what the book "wiseguy" and the movie "goodfellas" did to "the godfather" fable and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism lore.<br /><br />now, what irritated me most while watching these movies, and will probably irk anyone who saw and liked "boogie nights", is how foolish and gullible supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be. "dirk diggler" in "boogie nights" is without a doubt john holmes, who unlike "dirk diggler", had no redeeming quality. holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him, was totally consumed by his quest for self-gratification, and was without a doubt a key participant in the brutal murders on wonderland avenue in los angeles in 1981. the movie lays bare the big lie that "boogie nights" was, and reinforces the linda lovelace description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry. this should be required viewing, both features on the "wonderland" dvd, for anyone who had any positive opinions on the story in the movie "boogie nights".
