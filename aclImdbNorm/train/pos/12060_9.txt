i really miss the production of good old fashion spooky films. if ismail merchant and james ivory had been given the task of producing such a film it may have been this one, save for the lack of an internationally known, top drawer cast. this is one of those films that you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn, and you don't even bother doing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers. bravo to director herbert wise, writers susan hill and nigel kneale, top production design by jon bunker, art direction by john ralph and an excellent cast for making me shudder and feel so isolated even though i'm living in one of the most populated cities in the world in the beginning of the 21st century. i gave it a "9" out of "10" because with the production and budget constraints of television, they really pulled of a great show.
