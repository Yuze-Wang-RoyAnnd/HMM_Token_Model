for those of you that don't that reference, clubberin was 4 fists hitting one body...<br /><br />anyways, onto the review.<br /><br />i miss wcw saturday night. some of my favorite wrestling moments took place on this stage. i remember watching stunning steve austin, rick rude, brian pillman, cactus jack, dustin rhodes, johnny b. badd, ddp in his jobber days, lord steven regal, harlem heat, ricky steamboat, sting...i'd be here a while listing everyone. point is wcw had an awesome roster in the pre hogan days and they were producing entertaining television. dusty rhodes on commentary in it's later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when i started smoking pot as a teenager...i really wish vince would put him on the mic for a show or two, maybe at the next great american bash? they clubberin! here comes da plunda! he was great.<br /><br />-dirrty
