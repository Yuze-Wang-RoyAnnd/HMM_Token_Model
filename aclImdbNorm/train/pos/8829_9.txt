more directors like nacho vigalondo need a greater outlet for their talents. 7:35 de la ma~nana is absolute genius. what nacho is able to convey in 8 minutes takes some hollywood directors hours of film to achieve. i watched this smiling, but feeling a little dirty and not in the sexual way. you sit and wonder how you should feel after watching this 8 min. nugget. i was entertained, but was disturbed at the same time. not many people can do that in just 8 minutes. it starts off simple enough. a young women comes in for breakfast at her usual place. she sits down and someone starts singing. from there, the film takes you through so many different emotions all at once it is hard to describe. it is in black & white, but this helps with the feeling the film gives you.this film makes you want to know more about the characters, how they interacted previously and how the ending impacted their lives afterward. i guess it like the old saying,"leave them wanting more", nacho vigalondo is able to do that. watch this when you can. show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so much fun without taking off your clothes.
