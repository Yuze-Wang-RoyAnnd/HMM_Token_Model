this movie really surprised me. i had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for each minute. <br /><br />it is maybe not for the action seeking audience but for those that like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, man, lover and husband. if you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content this really is not for you. <br /><br />the storyline is somewhat hard to follow sometimes, but in the end i think it made everything better. the ending was unexpected since you were almost fouled to think it would end otherwise. <br /><br />as for the acting i think it was good. it will not be up for an oscar award for long but it at least caught my eye. gil bellows portrait of a prison man is not always perfect but it is very entertaining. shaun parkes portrait of bellows prison mate clinique is great and extremely powerful. on the downside i think i will put esai morales portrait of markie.<br /><br />take my advice and watch this movie, either you will love it or dislike it!
