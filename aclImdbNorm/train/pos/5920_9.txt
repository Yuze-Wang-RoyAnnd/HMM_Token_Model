american icon henry fonda portrays "elegant" john howard, an aging trucker who has had his beloved big rig "eleanor" repossessed after a lengthy hospital stay has forced him to miss his payments. deciding that he would like to make just one more perfect run, he breaks out of the hospital, steals back eleanor, and hooks up with old friend penelope pearson (eileen brennan), who is in need of relocating her troupe of prostitutes.<br /><br />fondas' wonderful performance is a natural anchor for a film that tugs at the heartstrings as effectively as it tickles the funny bone in the more comedic scenes. a superb cast including robert englund, as a reluctant young sidekick, susan sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit), and dub taylor (a delightful ham, as always, in the most blatantly comedic portion of the picture) helps immeasurably.<br /><br />the ultimately life-affirming nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey carry incredible weight; this is a picture, that provided you get into it, you can remember long after it's over.<br /><br />the promise of the open road is vividly displayed here; the countryside just looks beautiful. set to craig safans' wonderful music score, it's a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics.<br /><br />it loses a little something in its final act (the characters played by john byner and austin pendleton are little more than intrusions), but it still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters.<br /><br />not at all the exploitation / drive-in schlock picture one might expect from the title (especially its alternate title, "the great smokey roadblock"), it's a rewarding movie experience that i can recommend without qualms.<br /><br />9/10
