the movie was a long awaited release, which where a bit disappointing because of the expectation's i had set up. when looking at it again i must say it is actually pretty ok. first of all is it very true to the original history (of course not completely) and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie. modesty's history as a child is shown and is very true to the original. the acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin, but when you compare it to the 1966 vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical. generally would i only recommend it to fans of modesty blaise or to someone who by catch it on the tv.
