i loved this movie! it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it, but it is really very uplifting. i was struck by the performance of ray liotta, but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying ray's twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event. but tom's character, though heartbreaking, knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life. this is a great movie, don't miss it!!
