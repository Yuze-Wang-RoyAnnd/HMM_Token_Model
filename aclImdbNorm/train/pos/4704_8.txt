this movie is just a lot of fun. i've seen it a couple of times, but it always has something funny that i remember. the "duckies and bunnies" car scene is one of my favorites, and i still quote morone's versions of certain words!<br /><br />there are so many running jokes, that it's amazing. but i love michael keaton anyhow!
