this film could have been a silent movie; it certainly has the feel of one. i was extremely, extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this film. extase, is a 'symphony of love', and transcends all language versions. french, which is the ultimate romantic language, seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version.a young hedy lamarr lights up the screen, in this film which, in a way is almost like a sex fantasy; but definitely far from being pornographic.tech qualities may have been a little crude; but that does not detract from the magical spell this film exudes.many lovers of early cinema, would absolutely adore this film.
