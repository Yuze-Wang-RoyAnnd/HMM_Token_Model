i first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an itv (before the days of cable and satellite) matin'ee. i was off school with the mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film. i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it. david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around. i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than sean connery or anthony hopkins. the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger livesy, marius goring and an early appearance from richard attenborough.
