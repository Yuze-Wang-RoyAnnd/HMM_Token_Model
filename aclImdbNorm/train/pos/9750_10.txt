yes, giorgio, is a feel good movie. a little romance, great music, beautiful scenery, comedy, (a great food fight), and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of yes, giorgio. any movie buff would enjoy this film. those who require massive special effects, should look elsewhere. most of us need a little escape now and then, and how better to do this, than with a feast for the eyes, ears, and heart? a must see!
