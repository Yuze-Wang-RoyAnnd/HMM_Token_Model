i don't have much to add to my summary, this film ranks right up the there with top gun as one of the funniest films ever made while not trying to be. i for one don't think it should be taken seriously when watched as it is very enjoyable.<br /><br />i don't think it brings christopher walken's reputation down either as his reputation was on the wane back then anyway. it took pulp fiction to wake him from the slumber he had been in. as for michael ironside, he has been in some of the great funny while not trying to be serious films. total recall, top gun. what i think is amazing is the budget this movie had. the scenes and actors and explosions etc. are quite amazing so obviously someone liked it quite a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. whoever he or she was i like them because i love this film! <br /><br />if anyone reads this looking for information on mcbain (and i seriously doubt there'll be too many) just know that it is a hilarious movie and should be viewed with a smile on your face!
