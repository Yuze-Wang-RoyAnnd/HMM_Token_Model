this movie was very good. if you are one who likes to watch horror movies, i recommend it. the acting was very good although i thought that the actress playing julie could have had more emotion behind her lines. allan was very good and i thought the cinematography was amazing. i was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming. it was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen. i give it two thumbs up! i definitely would say that if you haven't already seen it then go rent it. if you have seen it and didn't like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal. i also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my school's campus.
