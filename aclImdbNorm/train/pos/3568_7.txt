this film moves the cinderella story forward to the early 1950s and makes good, if eccentric, use of the isle of man as a background. the ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous upper-class english girls, and together with kathleen turner as the stepmother they flounce about in various wonderful period costumes. the story is altered a little from the traditional version: early on it is oddly combined with the plot of "king lear", and in later stages cinderella is rather more assertive than is usual. it looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well, but does go over the top at times.
