barbara stanwyck gives this early douglas sirk-directed, universal-produced soap just the kick that it needs. not nearly as memorable as sirk's later melodramas, it's easy to see by watching "all i desire" where sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years. stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown, u.s.a, after deserting them a decade earlier. her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return. some of the cinematography is amazing, and stanwyck is tough-as-nails and really gives this film a shot of energy. overall, a fairly good show.
