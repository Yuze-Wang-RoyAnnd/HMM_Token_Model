first off, let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her. but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie. anyhow, no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did. i watched it and absolutely loved it. yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny. it was not degrading in any way.<br /><br />every actor and actress did a superb job. i laughed very hard at the sexual humor. overall, i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it. it is adorable and just plain fun to watch. i rarely rank movies as a 10 but i give this one a 10!!!<br /><br />go find it and watch it!
