this short was nominated for an academy award and i wish it had won! basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians, including lester young and joe jones, the music is incredible! hollywood quite often embraced jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not) but this is a rare look on film at an improvisational jam. this has been added to the film preservation list and deservedly so. tcm runs this as filler periodically and runs it every march sometime for its' "31 days of oscar" tribute. from downtown at the buzzer, swish, nothing but net and the shot's so smooth, the net barely moved. most solidly and highly recommended!!!
