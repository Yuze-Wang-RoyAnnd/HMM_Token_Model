this movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from april 10, 2002 through april 14, 2002 in the venezuelan presidential palace, caracas venezuela.<br /><br />the pathos of the movie is real and one feels the pain, sorrow and joy of the people who lived through this failed coup d'etat of president hugo chavez.<br /><br />one comes away from viewing this film that hugo chavez is truly a great historical figure. hugo chavez's persona single-handedly brought the venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day old military-installed junta and re-establish the democratically installed government of venezuela.<br /><br />it is obvious from the film footage that george w bush aided and abetted the venezuelan coup d'etat. that the mainstream media aided and abetted george w bush is not surprising.<br /><br />what is surprising is how few people has seen this movie and how few people realize the total corruption of america's mass media.<br /><br />it has taken only 20 years for ronald reagan elimination of the fairness doctrine in 1986 to turn america into blind and rudderless state.<br /><br />may hugo chavez open patriotic americans' eyes to the truth and beauty of the true american vision.
