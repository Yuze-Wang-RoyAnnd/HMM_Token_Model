babyface - notorious barbara stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power- he tries to get her to read nietzche- she says books ain't never done her no good.soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others.finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city.we follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank.the dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted hollywood production code.look for a cameo by a young john wayne as one of stanwyck's willing victims.part of the forbidden hollywood collection - i watched the extended version- the dvd has both versions plus red-headed woman and waterloo bridge.an interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that stanwyck would play in the era of film noir. b+
