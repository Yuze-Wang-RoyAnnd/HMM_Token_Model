barriers seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time. after it's transmission in the early 80s and one repeat, it's since sunk without trace. this is a crying shame.<br /><br />i originally watched this when it was transmitted in the southern tv region on sunday afternoons and was classic tea-time viewing. although i don't remember a great deal about the program, a few things stuck in my mind. most notable were the unforgettable titles. the mournful flute music accompanying the attempted escape across an east european border and the subsequent car crash (and that scene has left me with an abiding love of 'fintail' mercedes models as they used a merc 200). although it wasn't obvious at the start, the solution to the series' mystery was in these titles.<br /><br />the plot about a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovers he was adopted had lots of twists and turns but barriers was a surprisingly 'adult' children's drama. benedict taylor was excellent as billy and it was a shame he didn't do a lot more.<br /><br />this was a quality drama, well overdue for a dvd release and i hope i'll get the chance to re-acquaint myself with it in the future.<br /><br />a fond memory from my childhood
