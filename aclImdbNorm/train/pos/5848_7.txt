and i gave it a high 7.....<br /><br />why? because it bloody well rocked. at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys/games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories. as others have said here it was ahead of its time. <br /><br />sadly this is why the show was doomed. they have released 4 dvds with 16 episodes of the series so far. i am hoping that more come out. <br /><br />how does this compare watching it now 20 years after it first came out.. i don't know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation, and that imho is it's only flaw. the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition........ <br /><br />i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order... the dvds are good but i don't think the stories are in their proper order, but despite this the show rocked.
