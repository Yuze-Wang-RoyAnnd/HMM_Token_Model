i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again, on dvd, over thirty years later. the pictures over the opening credits have never left me. it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it. my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me, and we always discussed the programme afterwards. it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our school's public exams!<br /><br />sir laurence olivier's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect. i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war. i cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it. maybe an similar cold war series could now be contemplated, although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />buy it!
