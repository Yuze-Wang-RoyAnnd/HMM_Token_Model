enjoyed the movie very much. certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more, and there is truly a lot more historically to find out!<br /><br />did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization, particularly of the shooting event? there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at? prince albert's contribution to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on it's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here.<br /><br />the costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this production (which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one) wanted badly for a british court historical etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york? i.e. did princess victoria really stuff an entire truffle/rissole(?) into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his majesty with her mouth full? <br /><br />'could never really felt that sympathetic to victoriain this movie, or indeed in her shoes at all. yet loved the casting of the principals, whose acting was convincing, so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well? i always felt like a totally detached, uninformed outside observer, much more so than with "mrs. brown" or even "the queen". yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen, except that is for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time.
