its about time that gunga din is released on dvd. i cannot accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but, i never tire of it. the lead actors worked so well together. victor mclaglen (sgt mcchesney), cary grant (sgt cutter) and douglas fairbanks jr (sgt ballentine) are an unbeatable team.<br /><br />i just cannot get over their exploits in india. your first glimpse at the sergeants three, is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so-called treasure map. the three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town- or so they think.<br /><br />they engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few "residents" in hiding. soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base.<br /><br />later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din. they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters. din is sent to fetch help and cutter gets captured. soon mcchesney and ballentine arrive with din, and they are too captured.<br /><br />faced with being killed, they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them. the evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the british to the ambush. in doing this, din is shot dead.<br /><br />the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them. at the end, din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the british army.
