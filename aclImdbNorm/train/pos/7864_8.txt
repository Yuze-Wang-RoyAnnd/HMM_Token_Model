this is yet another tell-it-as-it-is madhur bhandarkar film. i am not sure why he has this obsession to show child moles***ion and g*y concepts to the indian filmy audience, but i find some of those scenes really disgusting! what's new? it is a nice piece put together by bhandarkar, where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film, mr & mrs iyer. what makes this movie different is, that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with, such as her roomies, her colleagues, film stars, models, rich people and others featured in the entertainment page#3 in her newspaper.<br /><br />noticeable: it is another good performance from mrs iyer. she is likely to be noticed for this role. she does selective roles but shines in them. she is noticeably de-glamorized and less beautiful in this film. but then, entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover, right? verdict: madhur has come up with another good movie, that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely. however, this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey.<br /><br />is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the real crime reporter? is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press? or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and g*y folk. the other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co-stars, if they wish to enter bollywood.<br /><br />in addition, he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people, etc. he also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families.<br /><br />this was all okay for me.. but might be too complex for an average movie-goer, who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work
