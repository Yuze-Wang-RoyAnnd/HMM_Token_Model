beautifully done. a lot of angst. friendship may not endure all, but in the end it's all that matters, or so a group of friends learn. i have watched it over and over again. the music is also amazing. when kei loses the one friend he has he gives up until he meets sho, an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature. in the lawless streets of mallepa they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of asian races, and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay. a surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does. i couldn't get enough of it. gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting, proving they are more than pretty boys who sing.
