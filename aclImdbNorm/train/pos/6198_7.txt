i'm one of those people who'd crawl a mile through broken glass to see a hal hartley film. from trust and iris to henry fool and (my hartley favorite) no such thing, hal's unique brand of movies are an acquired taste. infusing equal parts mystery/espionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte. the comedy isn't in your face necessarily, and often runs throughout an entire scene before coming to fruition. and that's the case with fay grim, the sequel to henry fool.<br /><br />parker posey stars as fay grim, abandoned wife of henry fool and mother to henry's only son ned. fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a cia agent in her kitchen. his name is fulbright (jeff goldblum, man of the year) and he wants henry's notebooks. there are many henry fool notebooks and they were all previously believed to contain nothing but mad wanderings. apparently there's much more to them. secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists? who knows but henry. agent fulbright tells fay that her husband is dead but this is quickly surmised as a ruse to get fay out of her home and searching for henry (and it works ...but not the way they think).<br /><br />fay battles multiple spy rings to gather henry's notebooks and to seek him out. she also makes a deal with the cia to get her brother simon (james urbaniak) out of prison (he'd helped henry escape the country in the original henry fool film.) multiple overlapping events occur in rapid succession: spy rings shoot each other to death, henry is discovered being held in "safety" by a jihadist, fay frees her brother but unknowingly risks her son's life, and the cia gets its comeuppance for putting fay in danger.<br /><br />hal hartley obviously loves to play with themes. and he does so to the extreme here. even character names (grim, fool, fulbright, fogg) have implicit meanings of their own that are quite funny. the over-the-top espionage films of ol' are given plenty of screen time, too, as guns blaze in stop-motion sequences, never striking our heroine even though she's right in the line of fire.<br /><br />now that i've heaped praise on this creation, i will say that parker posey's excessive portrayal of fay grim isn't the best part of the film, which is a shame considering how much time she's on-screen. i realize this was probably what mr. hartley wanted: an uncurbed woman with hand gestures to the italian extreme. but it was still painful to watch at times.<br /><br />even so, fans will probably devour fay grim and beg for more. though this wasn't my favorite hal hartley film, i know i'm ready.
