i thought this movie was lol funny. it's a fun, not to be taken seriously, movie about one man's twisted views on life, love, and... well, ladies "from the lowly bus station skank, to the high-class d'ebutante... bus station skank." tim meadows plays a guy (leon phelps) who was raised by in a playboy-style mansion by a hugh hefner-esquire father figure, surrounded constantly by beautiful porn models and actresses. when his "father" kicks him out on the street he must learn to fend for himself with nothing but the chauvinistic outlook on life that his youth has taught him... that and an unfathomable, nearly mystical level of charm and dumb luck. and so the hijinx begin! if you haven't seen this movie and you enjoy a light-hearted, semi-mindless, comedy/love story, then i highly recommend renting "the ladies' man".
