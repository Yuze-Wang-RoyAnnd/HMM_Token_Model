this is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans! i think that sue price did a great job in this film series (nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula (nemesis 2). though not a film of great value and sue price's acting skills not the best to have met in my life, the movie itself was something awesome, a priceless gem for fans of female body-builder action! well, some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi films, such as terminator or predator, but that's not the point. the point is that a.puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). what a pity it hasn't shown yet on dvd :-(
