this tv-series was one of the ones i loved when i was a kid. even though i see it now through the pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia, i can still tell it was a quality show, very educational but still funny. i have not seen the original french version, only the swedish. i have no idea how good the dubbing was, it was too long ago to remember.<br /><br />the premise of the show was to show you how the body works. i swear, school still hasn't taught me half of what i know from this show. it also tied in other things, like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don't exercise, with nice examples within the body. who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you? :d the cartoon looked nice, very kids friendly of course, but done with care. cells, viruses, electric signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures, looking pretty much how you'd expect what they should look like in the animated body.<br /><br />this, and the series about history(especially the environmentally scary finale) were key parts of my childhood. i'm so happy i found them here.
