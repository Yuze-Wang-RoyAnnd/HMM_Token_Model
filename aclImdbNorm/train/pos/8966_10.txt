this is a wonderful film, makes the 1950's look beautifully stylish. kim novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern-day witch with one foot in manhattan and another in infinity. all the supporting performances are terrific, from jack lemmon as her bother nicky to ernie kovacs as the author of magic in mexico who is working on magic in manghattan, to elsa lanchester as the slightly batty as well as witchy aunt queenie. and then there is the cat- i have no idea how many witches (besides me) have named a cat pyewacket but suggest a zillion. jmes stewart looks out of place, but only just as much as his character is out of p;ace in this weird sub-world of magic and witchcraft. perfect. and it has the perfect romantic happy ending, which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings. gillian and shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as rose and charlie allnut in the african queen (another great film)
