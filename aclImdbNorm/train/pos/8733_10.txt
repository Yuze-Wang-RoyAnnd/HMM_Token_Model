when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story. as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature! i was right! a bug's life like toy story is great story, great characters and great animation. my favorite characters are dim the rhino beetle voiced by brad garrett and hemlich the caterpillar voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft. my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick (david hyde pierce) lifts up hemlich trying to distract the bird and hemlich's like you hoo mr. early bird. how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slim's like i'm going to snap! i'm going to snap! i just died laughing at that scene. being a big fan of insects i think a bug's life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever! i don't know how you could hate a pixar film! i think they're all pretty good films! good job pixar!
