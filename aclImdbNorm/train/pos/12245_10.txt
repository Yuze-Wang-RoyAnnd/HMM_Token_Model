this is the best emma in existence in my opinion. having seen the other version (1996) which is also good, and read the book, i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austen's masterpiece. the 1996 movie with g. paltrow is good too, it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether. it's very light and fluffy, you don't see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie, that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points, such as the churchill/fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non-existent. but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit, more real and multidimensional, the 1996 tv version is the superior. emma is a remarkable person, but she is flawed. kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character. you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith, yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriet's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending. you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchill's in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims. for emma, it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage. for frank churchill, it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret. in the book, she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made. both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrow's is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsale's awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child-like, selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult. both versions are very good but i prefer this one.
