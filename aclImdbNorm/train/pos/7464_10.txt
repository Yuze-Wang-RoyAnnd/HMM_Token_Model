made me think about it for days after seeing it. that to me is the mark of a great movie. eyes wide shut had the same effect on me. i am tired of these people requiring these happy hollywood cookie-cutter endings. i am planning on going to see it again tonight to understand the plot a little better - but regardless, the emotional messages of the movie were totally felt.
