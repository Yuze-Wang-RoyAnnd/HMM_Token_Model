ever read jim thompson? he's hard-boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy i've ever encountered. there are rarely private detectives in his work - just losers, psychotics and small-time con artists. this film has thompson nailed - "if god made any real mistakes in this world, it was in giving us a will to live when we've got no excuse for it." every character in the film balances on a razor's edge between surreal and creepy realism. there's sleazy, conniving uncle bud, played by bruce dern and spookily well-intentioned doc goldman played by george dickerson. jason patric gives a wonderful, often heart-wrenching performance as kid collins, a none-too-bright, shy ex-fighter who's more scared of himself than of anyone else. rachel ward is fay, the sexy femme fatale who we can't quite figure out...it's not your standard film noir, nor is it intended to be. after dark my sweet, along with the grifters, are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers, jim thompson.
