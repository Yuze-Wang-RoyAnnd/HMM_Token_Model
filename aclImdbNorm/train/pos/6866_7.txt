**************possible spoilers********** there is only one reason why i saw this movie and that was because i have a massive crush on richard belzer.(i don't know that much about humor) there were some part that were funny like the barbie and ken spoof and the dealers and the president skit. mind you this is sometimes raunchy(dare, i say crude?) it was at times funny, but it could have been better. probably if they spent more time in the humor and less time getting women undress, the movie would had been funnier. some skits just make you want to gag, and cringe, others skits make you laugh and oddly enough think. sadly this movie is dated. if you have a mad crush on richard belzer(so worth it) it's worth checking it out and seeing chevy chase.
