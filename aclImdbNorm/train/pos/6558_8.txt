i disagree with previous comment about this movie. i think it was cute and fun and it carried a good message for young girls like my daughter. you don't have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool. you can be smart and pretty and classy all at once.<br /><br />i think the cast was good and the story was fine for the target audience. all-in-all my wife, daughter (10) and i each thought it was a good movie. i certainly recommend it. it also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original nancy drew mysteries which i am sure she will love much as i loved the hardy boys. <br /><br />it was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away. i can't think of a better outcome for that movie than rekindling interest in that classic series.
