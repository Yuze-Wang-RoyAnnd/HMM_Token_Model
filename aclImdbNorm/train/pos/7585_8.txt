this is a strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. if there is such a thing as "intellectual horror" cinema, this film is it. i started to get scared and wish there was someone else watching it with me, and it barely has a plot! i'm going to have to see this film again multiple times before i feel i really understand it. if you're the kind of person who likes "my dinner with andre" and films by godard, or if you do a lot of mind-altering drugs, you will probably enjoy this film. wow.
