the japanese "run lola run," his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone's face. fans of run lola run, tampopo, go!, and slacker will probably like this one. it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate, seemingly unrelated vignettes, all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways. catch it if you see it, otherwise wait for the rental.
