after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb, i was extremely pleased with the film. the film was dark, moving, the anger, the pain, the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon.<br /><br />i had initially expected to see many special effects, and like a lover's caress, it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it. brian, i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects. you will go a long way, my friend. i will definitely be the president of your fan club.<br /><br />eric etebari, the best actor award, was the number one choice. you made jr. lopez look like a child compared to kasadya. :) <br /><br />overall, the acting, story line, the high quality filming and awesome effects, it was fantastic. i just wish it were longer. i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations.
