the acting is pretty cheesy, but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now detroit area automotive engineers, this is a great movie. i even work with a japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny.<br /><br />jay leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show! he looks pretty young here...17 years ago. the opening scene, with the drag race on what appears to be woodward ave was great.<br /><br />leno also owns some bad a** cars now, it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection. i'm sure the blown vette in the opening scene was his own car.<br /><br />typical 80s movie. watch it and enjoy. no computer generated crap!
