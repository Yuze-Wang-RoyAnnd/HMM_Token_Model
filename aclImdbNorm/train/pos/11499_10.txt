since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed. this show was a 70s version of the poplular 90's tv series "x-files"- but with a bit more of a comedic/light hearted approach. but don't get me wrong, some of these episodes have full on horror themes, many in which have some pretty greuesome plots (left to the imagination of course- this was the early 70s television).<br /><br />some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting, but that is the charm and attraction to this series. whether you like mystery crime dramas, comedies, or sci-fi/horror themes, this series brought all that together. each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so (1 hour with commercials) and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more. a great classic show that is underrated in my book!
