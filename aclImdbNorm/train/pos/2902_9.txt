i sit through movies like "tiempo de valientes" and i want to talk about cinema for hours. the admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation, because i'm watching the scenes of the film and i search inside my thoughts for film-making ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than damian szifron's mind.<br /><br />looking the environment, so uncompromised, so simple, i'm thinking; this man is a genius. no wonder he created what is probably the best television show argentina ever witnessed, and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors haven't still achieved. "el fondo del mar" is the name and, it awakened (a few years ago), my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema.<br /><br />starting his journey from people's daily real lives, szifron goes where pablo trapero never could in "el bonaerense"; the federal police department's life. trapero's film was a journey into a man's mind and experiences, not into the places he saw. yes, there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations, but szifron in "in there", his is more of a detective story, like the ones we know and love, with the mysteries and the thrilling music.<br /><br />but there's a lot of humanity in his writing, and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters, alfredo d'iaz and mariano silverstein. there are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film, but these two actors are the ones the film can't do without. the first character (luis luque) is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him; and has to work on a case.<br /><br />the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective. he wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins d'iaz in his routines: "it's nothing, the usual stuff; no problem". but it is bigger than that, and it will unfold a part of the doctor's personality he didn't know.<br /><br />the relationship developed between the two leads can't be explained unless it is observed, because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like szifron that are trying, today, to leave a signature in our history. reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity, during a high pressure situation, d'iaz tells silverstein: "how do we continue our treatment?", and silverstein answers: "no, i'm not your doctor. you call me to have dinner; i'm your friend": we laugh because we can't help it.<br /><br />and we can't help laughing when d'iaz crashes a car in the street and doesn't gives importance to it, or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street, or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and silverstein can't believe it (but then smokes it too because he's screwed up); or when silverstein tries to be friendly with d'iaz's robber friends. magic from diego peretti is what we receive there. he, a psychiatrist himself, gives a performance in plan "locas de amor", but impresses with all his range. luis luque on the other hand, is back on track with a top-notch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is.<br /><br />there's a passion i have for this, and as i said, i could write about it for hours, but unfortunately that's not the way it works and i have to be precise and summarize. although i have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them, i could assure that "tiempo de valientes" is the comedy argentina had been waiting for and never got
