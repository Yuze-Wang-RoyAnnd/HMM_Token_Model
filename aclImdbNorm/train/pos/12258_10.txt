jane austen's emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen. kake beckinsale's emma is irreproachable. gwyneth paltrow, (with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography) is able to bring out the comedy effectively, she fails to make emma likeable. paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply 'wrong' for the part (and i believe the era) and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses. kate beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly (the most romantic of jane austen's heroes) actually sees in her. mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks, an appropriate age, chivalry, compassion and gentlemanly behaviour. emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful.
