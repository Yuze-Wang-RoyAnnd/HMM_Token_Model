if you r in mood for fun...and want to just relax and enjoy...bade miyan chote miyan is one of the movies to watch. amitabh started off pretty good...but it is govinda who steals the show from his hands... awesome timing for and good dialog delivery.....its inspired from bad boys... but it has indian masala to it... people think it might be confusing and stupid...but the fact that david dhavan is directing and govinda is acting... should not raise any questions....other recommended movies in the same genre(david dhavan/govinda combo)...are shola aur shabnam, aankhen, raja babu, saajan chale sasural, deewana mastana, collie no. 1, jodi no. 1, hero no.1, haseena manjayegi, ek aur ek gyarah.
