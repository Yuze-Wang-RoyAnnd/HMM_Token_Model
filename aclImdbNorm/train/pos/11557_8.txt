often laugh out loud, sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys -- lemmon a neurotic clean "house husband" and matthau a slob sportswriter -- who decide to live together to cut down on expenses. <br /><br />nicely photographed and directed. the script is very barbed -- that is, there's always more than one side to almost every line. particularly funny scene involves 2 british sisters (evans and shelley) who seem amused by everything anyone says, but when lemmon busts out his photos of kids and, yes, ex-wife-to-be, he has the girls sobbing along with him before matthau can show up with the promised drinks!<br /><br />very entertaining.
