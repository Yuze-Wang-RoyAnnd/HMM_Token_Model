on the basis of the preview i'd seen, i went to "shower" expecting a sweet little comedy; what i found was a profoundly touching drama of family life told in some of the most lush photographic images i've ever been privileged to see. in addition, later reflection made me appreciate the abrupt cuts to scenes from the past (in the arid countryside of northern china, and in the high plain of tibet): isn't this how memory often works? one moment i'm here, the next i'm in a landscape from the past, just like that....<br /><br />i would not only strongly recommend this film, i would place it among the two or three finest films i've seen in my 60 years.<br /><br />by the way, a couple of years ago another asian "comedy" was released in the united states as "shall we dance?" (japanese). just as with "shower," the preview gave not the slightest indication of the depth of that film, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (albeit chock full of funny moments). is there a fear, on the part of distributors, of making films appear too "important" or "deep" to appeal to u. s. viewers?
