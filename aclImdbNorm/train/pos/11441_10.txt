as a person who sought out an existence as a 'professional' person with income backed by a bs in chemistry and ms in business management, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic. my post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening.<br /><br />i also keep healthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to remote destinations in california and nearby states like utah, arizona, and nevada. jogging, walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds.<br /><br />within that background, i was obsessed with rivers and tides. i was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist andy goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of director/cinematographer thomas riedelsheimer. i actually could not separate the art of goldsworthy with camera path of riedelsheimer.<br /><br />wonderful. wonderful. wonderful.
