i always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old slovenian movies seemed to have in them... well, in time i wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia. or did that "feeling" decide to pack its bags and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history, and then never came back? or did it? because for me, it came back the first time i saw "ekspres, ekspres". and it was it's old self again.<br /><br />there are three qualities of this movie that makes it somewhat unique and as enjoying as it is to watch - the smooth flow of the story, the warmth of the colors and, what i appreciated the most - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (something many of other (not just) slovenian screenwriters should at least consider). there is no use for words, when you can understand each other just as well (yeah, or better) by other means in use. just watch bakovic and cerar. uh.<br /><br />so this, in only so many words, is why i would recommend "ekspres, ekspres" to all of you, as a must-see slovenian movie, regardless of what you may heard of slovenian films (if you ever even heard anything , that is...).<br /><br />oh, and that scene, where bakovic is dancing to vivaldi's music... a treat.<br /><br />treat yourself. watch it.
