very slight spoiler<br /><br /> this movie (despite being only on tv) is absolutely excellent. i didn`t really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents, so i can`t really comment on that. the acting in this was so good i had to pinch myself and say "remember, it`s only a movie, this didn`t really happen". as i sat and listened to harris and quinn talk, i knew that it was exactly what john and paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting. the offhanded comments and burns from john were right on with his character(especially in the restaurant!), as was his depression while paul was very easy going and laid back. both actors did and excellent job and i was thrilled to have seen this movie. it`s a wicked experience for any beatles fan. and prepare for a few surprises!
