it is an excellent thriller from turkey which can make sense.great job from gokbakar brothers.<br /><br />first of all,i want to point on screen play.generally screen play in most films from turkey is not enough,but gen has the best shots to be said "perfect".and also transition parts are really excellent.<br /><br />on the other hand,"gen" has a great topic that influence everyone.especially,a woman ,who wants to be a psyciatrist in a sanitarium ,has a mother that is a habitual insanity.principal causes and psychological consequences are given in gen.the only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints.<br /><br />there is an impressive aggression part doga rutkay and sahan gokbakar played.this performance may be more realistic than " irr'eversible(monica bellucci) ".<br /><br />the last thing i want to say is "watch this movie,you'll get confused"
