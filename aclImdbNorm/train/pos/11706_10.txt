to all the reviewers on this page, i would have to say this movie is worth seeing. so it was made in 1972, so what. the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time. people who didn't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball. compared to the modern series, `left behind,' (which is made for our time right now) it does look cheezy. however, the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion, which again was over 30 years in the past. but. the message that is sent in this film is very powerful, and carefully preserved. there is just so much to say, but i refuse to say it. (for fear of spoiling it) so go out and see this film! if you don't like the message that it sends, then you have issues, that need some attention!
