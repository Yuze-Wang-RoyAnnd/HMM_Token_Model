i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney. this movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and i have been looking for it. i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then,, this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once, i really hoped i would get to see it again. the story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory. to this day, i never did see it after that day back in the 70s, in fact, i never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me. i loved it and want my kids to see it.does anybody know where i can find it?
