as i have matured, my fascination with the academy awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement. as in a few other comments that i have written, the bizarre results of academy award voting are often difficult to explain. the omission of "in cold blood" in 1967 as one of the five best picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances, especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable "dr. dolittle." while only an insomniac or masochist would tune in to that rex harrison disaster, richard brook's powerful adaptation of truman capotes non-fiction novel retains its ability to capture the viewer's attention and leave him or her completely drained by the final fade out. while there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen, the film is definitely adult material. based on a nebraska multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place, "in cold blood" was filmed by master cinematographer conrad hall in stark black and white, and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio. together with quincy jones's unsettling score, hall's work should have been credited above the title with brook's screenplay as the three pillars on which this intense classic is built. the performances are fine as well. scott wilson is all cold charm and robert blake intense introversion as the two killers. (there is an inside joke at one point when blake speaks of bogart and "the treasure of the sierra madre" while the duo are driving to mexico. as a child star, blake sold the lottery ticket to bogart in that john huston film.) the film, like the book, is definitely slanted towards the killers and has an anti-capital punishment tilt, although the remorselessness of the murderers somewhat negates that sentiment despite the difficult-to-watch final scenes. some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals, their backgrounds, and lives, while the clutter family, which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night, come across as one-dimensional characters of little import. this lack of balance comes from the book as capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row. the clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth. however, whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment, "in cold blood" will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts. run a double bill with "dead man walking," and you may not speak for days.
