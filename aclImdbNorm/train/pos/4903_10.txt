inspired at least a little by ivy benson & her all girls orchestra, who performed throughout the war years at the covent garden opera house, this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly saxophone player to reform the (almost) all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the end of wwii. all too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music, and help to fill in the background to the band members, and in particular to the girls' relationships with the lone male member - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to dodge the call-up).<br /><br />ian holm ("lord of the rings", "cromwell and fairfax") and judi dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed elizabeth, and the conniving, womanizing patrick, the drummer. the late joan sims is perfect as the band's leader, now playing bar piano at the sea-side, and june whitfield glows as the salvation army trombone player. cameo appearances by other greats like cleo laine, leslie caron, olympia dukakis and billie whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. the movie is a romp down memory lane, with an all star cast of what ought, by all rights, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. all i can say is, i hope i look as good at their age! leslie caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years of age. she certainly still gets my pulse going! as i watched it, i was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age. afterwards, i looked these girls up, and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the london of 1944 (although this might be a bit of a stretch for judi dench).<br /><br />if you like swing bands, thrive on nostalgia, or just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her, don't miss this film.<br /><br />
