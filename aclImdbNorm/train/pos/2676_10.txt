everyday we can watch a great number of film, soap... on tv. sometimes a miracle happens. a great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realisator-director. for me there are two films that everyone needs to see : the first is the pacula ? "sophie 's choice" with meryl streep. the second is "journey of hope". as human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. we also have to struggle against racism and fascim. we must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love our earth companion. this wonderful film, helps us reaching john (lennon) his dream : imagine all the people living live in peace. these two films are difficult to see : watch these, but sure you will be hurt, but better. great film, great actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also better understanding of the others. enjoy it.
