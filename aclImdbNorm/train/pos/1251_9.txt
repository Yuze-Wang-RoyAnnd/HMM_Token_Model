this documentary explores a story covered in pilger's latest book "freedom next time", which was published in 2006. it reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of diego garcia, one of the chagos islands in the indian ocean.<br /><br />the islanders are technically british citizens, as diego garcia is a british colony, much like mauritius, the nearby island to where the natives were exiled, used to be. but the british government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the united states army, who have used it as a basis for the bombing of iraq and afghanistan.<br /><br />as usual, pilger's coverage is shocking, especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. his interviews all round are excellent, and his cornering of a parliament representative where he uses the government's own information to pin him down, ranks as one of his best.<br /><br />pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the british conspiracy to evict the natives. the weaving of this footage with the interviews, and the islanders music, really heightens the film's impact.<br /><br />it is not easy viewing, but "stealing a nation" is john pilger at his best. recommended.
