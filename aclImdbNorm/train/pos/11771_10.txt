great entertainment from start to the end. wonderful performances by belushi, beach, dalton & railsback. some twists and many action scenes. the movie was made for me! funny lines in the screenplay, good music. dalton as the tough sheriff and railsback as "redneck-villain". i must recommend this film to every action-adventure fan! 10/10
