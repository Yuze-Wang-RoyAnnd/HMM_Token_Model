i am a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates, i think the sets were representative of the location and the era, i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band. however, i think the photography was amazing! since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley's had low ceilings--perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a "smoke-filled bar" hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dancing, the low-level of light that actually was in the bar! what a feat! sure there was auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low-light shots. ray villalobos (the camera operator) was outstanding! he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film. thanks, ray--great work!
