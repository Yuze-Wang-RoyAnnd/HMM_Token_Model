we taped this when it aired on tv back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release, for it quickly became one of our family favorites. the kids are now teens and must have seen it a ba-zillion times, yet they still watch it religiously with friends. it's timeless appeal reaches across all ages groups--similar to "grease."<br /><br />vanessa williams is spectacular. jason alexander delightful and wonderfully light on his feet. i've noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him, but our family gives him top ratings. (we loved his 'giant step' number.) marc kudisch (as conrad) supplies us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers. and brigitta dau (as ursula) just flat steals the show. probably our favorite character in the entire movie.<br /><br />the one disappointment was chynna philip's performance of kim. part of that has to do with the writing. kim's role is completely one-dimensional. complicating that, philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable and just plain awful. the director should have seen that and corrected it. or never cast her to begin with.<br /><br />overall, though, the picture is delightful and i highly recommend it for families of all ages.
