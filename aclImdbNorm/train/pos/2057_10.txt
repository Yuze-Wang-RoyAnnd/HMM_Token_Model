there wasn't a day in 2002 where i wasn't chased by a scarecrow i felt that this film handled a serious issue well<br /><br />it brought back a lot of memories as it was so realistic<br /><br />even today i have nightmares about corn on the cob, and can't even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my life<br /><br />i have to admit though, at one point in the film i did have to turn it off as it hit too close to home<br /><br />for those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims <br /><br />this film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn, believe me, i've been there and i have the scars <br /><br />watch the film, its amazing and educational
