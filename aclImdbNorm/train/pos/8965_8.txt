made in the same year as "vertigo," this is an equally bewitching movie, though in a much lighter vein. it's set in an enchanted new york during the winter: kim novak is a witch who casts a spell over james stewart, but gets caught in it instead. the interesting sidelight is that novak's rival is played by janice rule, who originated the part of madge in "picnic" on broadway (the part that novak would make famous on film).
