i couldn't hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary. it was heart-breaking, disturbing, and inspiring all in one. i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives. or simply, something that will make you think. you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life. you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude. at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual. you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us. his life and struggles will make you cry, laugh, and find that life's a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time.
