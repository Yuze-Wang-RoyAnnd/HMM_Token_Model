'the italian' is among the great or near-great films of 1915 that are available today. the year was a turning point for the feature-length film, especially in america: lois weber's 'hypocrites', cecil b. demille's 'the cheat' and, of course, d.w. griffith's 'the birth of a nation' set new benchmarks for the art. additionally, that year, russian filmmaker yevgeni bauer made two of his best pictures, 'after death' and 'daydreams'. the french serial 'les vampires' also has its admirers today, although i disagree with them. the emergence of the feature-length film was led by europe, mainly denmark, france and italy, but dominance of this market and, to a degree, the art shifted to across the atlantic in 1915.<br /><br />the most overriding artistic achievement of 'the italian' is its stunning and often innovative cinematography. there are some picturesque sunsets, mobile framing, including a brief overhead angled shot of the italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car, and, in general, there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout. an especially amazing shot is a close-up of the italian enraged as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close-up, in reference to d.w. griffith's 'musketeers of pig alley' (1912). he's so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his anger.<br /><br />unfortunately, the cinematographer appears to be unknown. the director, although originally without credit in the film, is now known to have been reginald barker. five or so of his other films made for ince are also available today, but are rather unremarkable. 'civilization' (1916), which he worked on, was a large production, but a deeply flawed movie. by the way, i'd guess that one or more of the various cinematographers who worked on 'civilization' also photographed 'the italian'.<br /><br />moreover, the entire production is very advanced for then. venice and new york are well rendered despite the film being shot in los angeles (for romanticized venice) and san francisco (for the ethnic slums of new york). there are extensive flashbacks, although perhaps one or two too many. i especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor, george beban, who is also the lead in the inner, main narrative. the reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain drapes, `a la the theatre, which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the child's room, with the opening and closing of window curtains. parallel editing, in-camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly. additionally, beban and clara williams, as his wife, play their parts well.<br /><br />on the other hand, 'the italian' does have a few drawbacks. the film's early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama, although the environmental changes from romanticized italy to naturalistic new york works well
