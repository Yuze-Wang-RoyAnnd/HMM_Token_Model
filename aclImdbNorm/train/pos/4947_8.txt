one can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as morgan freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs help.<br /><br />it all comes down to loving people. as will rogers said, "i never met a man i didn't like." of course, if you meet paz vega, what's not to like? that smile of hers can melt diamonds. she is just so fantastic that i can watch anything she is in. the same goes for freeman. he is just magic on the screen.<br /><br />the two of them gave us a film that was funny from start to finish. from the mexican supermarket to lorraine & bobby to packy. it was tender, charming and just plain funny.<br /><br />you have to check this out.
