i don't know the stars, or modern chinese teenage music - but i do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when i see one.<br /><br />kung fu dunk is pure hollywood in its values - it's played for laughs, for love, and is a great blend of kung fu and basketball.<br /><br />everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making this - the production values are excellent - and modern china looks glossier than los angeles here.<br /><br />the plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play (and love and more etc;) is great - this is fresh, fun, and immensely entertaining.<br /><br />with great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy - for all ages - and for our money was one of the best family movies we're seen in a long time.<br /><br />please ignore the negative reviews and give dunk a chance - we were really glad we did - a good sports comedy movie.
