i very much enjoyed "the revolution will not be televised". it gave me, once again, a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be governed.<br /><br />it is unfortunate that in venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. however, when their coup failed; after the interim government dissolved the supreme court, and the constitution, and the ombudsman, and the electoral boards, and all civil rights, no one took the plotters out behind a barn somewhere and shot them. they haven't even gone to jail. the major plotters are living in florida, carrying on. and the protection that they had was the "bolivarian constitution" passed by a large majority of the venezuelan people. it is not only history that bites. democracy can give you one hell of a nip if you let it loose. and in venezuela it is loose.
