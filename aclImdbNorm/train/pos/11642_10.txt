'intervention' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery. i'm a middle-aged married father of two. i'm quite functional in my personal and professional life. still, i have pain from my past that i use addictions to soothe, and issues from which i am slowly recovering. when these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family.<br /><br />the show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do, as alice miller says, "the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood." the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. this digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. so much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self-interest, and now they can't stop. not so: addictions are about killing pain. i can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives. there are common themes, and surprising exceptions. many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. some kids simply respond badly to divorce. to those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, i would just say that different people respond differently. although some kids handle divorce well, others, like cristy in the show, "collapse in a heap on the floor" and have their lives forever changed by the event.<br /><br />for example, last night's counselor said that pretty young andrea seeks validation from men. she strips for cash for a 75-year old neighbor and lets men abuse her. sound familiar to anyone? the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives. often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest. as they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it's made your life miserable.<br /><br />to the producers: thank you for making the show, for digging into the past, for the follow-ups. also, the graphics, the format, and the theme music are brilliant.<br /><br />to the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. whether or not you have helped yourself, you have helped me.
