i guess when "beat street" made a national appearance, "flashdance" came at the same time. the problem with "flashdance" is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. that was one of the reasons why "beat street" was better. the only movie that could rival "beat street" seems to be "footloose", because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings.<br /><br />the break-dance scenes in "beat street" come just before the middle and at the end of the flick. and i loved all of them. almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes: the jackhammer, the flares, the head spins, the suicide sit, the crazy legs, the mortal, the forward flip, the figure four---almost everything.<br /><br />like "the warriors", "beat street" does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world...but in a much less violent way than the former. the only major fight scene in "beat street" was when graffiti artist ramon (which in the movie was abbreviated as "ramo") is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway tracks.....fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail. well, although that chase scene ended tragically, it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot.<br /><br />most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip-hop culture, and rap music. a lot of rap music appeared in the flick, because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life. even the theme song of the movie, which closed the curtain to the flick, was not just an homage to hip-hop culture--it also was an homage to the death of ramon.<br /><br />by the way, during the dance scene called 'tango, tango', i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress rae dawn chong was sheila e. making a cameo appearance.
