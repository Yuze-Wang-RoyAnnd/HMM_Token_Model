i resisted seeing this movie and i understand why it was not a big hit in theatres. "october sky" feels and looks oh so familiar. and it is. all plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films -- and possibly even better. but despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas hollywood, this movie is winning and likeable at every turn. <br /><br />sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul. just as the characters from steven sondheim's musical merrily we roll along stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation ("what do you call it? you call it a miracle."), sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale. while jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event, homer hickham sees sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines.<br /><br />masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy homer and his pals seem fresh and new. especially affecting are subplots concerning homer's ailing young school teacher. remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship. also remarkable is the father / son supblot that anchors the film. perfectly played all around. even homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion. her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking. "myrtle beach" says it all. <br /><br />a major video chain i despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money. for once, i agree with them. you'll never look at the october sky quite the same again.<br /><br />
