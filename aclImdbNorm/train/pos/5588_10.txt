the first time i had the window of opportunity to see this all but forgotten classic was back in the early 1980's,at one of our art houses as a revival. as i watched this fever dream of an exercise in 1930's sexuality, i thought yowza! they got away with murder in europe back in the day. unfortunately, this film was heavily cut in it's original u.s. release by the blue nosed hayes office (the staunch government censorship board,started by the "holier than thou" bible thumper, will hayes...a former post office official,if you can believe that),due to it's overall theme of human sexuality (heaven's forbid humans actually had sex in the 1930's). the plot of ecstasy concerns a young woman (played by hedy lamarr)who marries a much older man,and later regrets it. she (lamarr)meets a handsome younger man & has an affair with him, resulting in a divorce from previous husband (another no no in hollywood movies back then---divorce!). despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the director's first time working in the sound format (i.e. the film seems to possess techniques that were used mostly in silent films---i.e. 1920's expressionism's). it's still worth searching out for a window into early european talking pictures,along with luis bunuels l'age dor (1930),and karl gustav dryer's 'vampyre' (1931). not rated,but contains that infamous nude swimming scene & some thinly veiled sexual references, which would fare little more than a pg-13 by today's standards (but would have easily landed the dreaded 'x',back in the 30's,if it existed then)
