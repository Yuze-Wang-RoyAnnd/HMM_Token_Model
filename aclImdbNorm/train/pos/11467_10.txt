this is the best movie i've come across in a long while. not only is this the best movie of its kind(school shooting)the way ben coccio(the director) decided to film it was magnificent. he filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school. he filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film. also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary. it is almost artful.(if that is indeed a word)there are a few slip ups however, for example when cal calls brads(?) land rover a range rover(or vice versa, it's been awhile since i've seen it)
