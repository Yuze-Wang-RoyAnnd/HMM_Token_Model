the movie is very realistic. absolutely, it does not belong to the hollywood cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise. the actors playing the roles of the lovers do a great job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts - their everyday life adventures. overall, the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state. this is where the realism of the whole story is apparent. not everything happens the way we think it should happen. i can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note. we watch, we learn, we experience ourselves. that is probably the moral of this story.
