this is the second baby burlesk short to be released, and probably the most popular one, is a spoof of the 1926 silent film what price glory.<br /><br />i watched this and i do not understand the kiddie-porn that is being claimed. it is just a cute little film. i have seen family shows that i grew up watching in the '80's and '90's that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a 'mature manner'. it was more provocative because they weren't dressed in diapers. there's nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes. (just a joke) i read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this. that is sick. to me, if you watch this and are bothered by it, then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you. it is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film. all of the b.b. films were parodies, nothing more. the parodies/spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language. shouldn't those be more appalling? i can watch those without issue, but they sometimes take children's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies. that is what should get under your skin. not that they babified (not a word, i know) an adult movie from 1926, because we know how pornographic those silent films were, huh? not to mention those 'forbidden hollywood pre-code era films' so vile and filthy. they would never make such filth today? (note the sarcasm)
