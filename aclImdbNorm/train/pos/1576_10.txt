this was a wonderful film. how these women tried to save their husbands. i thought that the performances of the actors were great. i had to think about the film for a very long time. i think that every student should see this film so that they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. i liked the film because it told and showed me how strong love can be. i wish i could be so strong as a woman. i really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that is what i like to see in a movie. i think you can compare the film with der untergang, the pianist. if you put these three films together, you have a great sight of what happened during the war. we should remember something like the war forever.
