i just don't understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here. jeez. it is mindless, it isn't polished and it is (as i am reading) wasted on some. the cast of this movie plays their characters to the 't' (if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed). these are misunderstood, well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination. the problem is they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! this is 3 times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group, likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel. i just don't get it. the jokes work on more then one level; if you didn't get it i know what level you're at.
