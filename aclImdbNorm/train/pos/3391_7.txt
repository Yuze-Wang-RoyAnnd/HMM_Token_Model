as with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is . overpopulation means there`s too many people to feed ? i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies . stalin`s policy in the soviet union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was mao`s rural policy in china which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s . and let`s not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation . you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth , hong kong and macau , have never suffered a famine in modern times . likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn`t strictly down to overpopulation - it`s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside ( it`s a symptom of industrial progress - not of too many births ) so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughable<br /><br />but don`t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of the<br /><br />70s . it plays on the contempary audience`s knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit , brandy and fresh meat . thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky , puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line " if i could afford it i`d smoke two , maybe three of these a day " . but it`s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that`s memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals , flowers , running water and snow covered mountains , a world thorn`s generation has never known . this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film , combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth
