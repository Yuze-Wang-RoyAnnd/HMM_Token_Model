im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you. this movie is awesome. from beginning to end, it is filled with genuine thrills. the fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are enthralling, and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained, but that is only because everything that preceded it. damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor, daring you not to believe him in this role. he is this role. a welcome addition to the series in david straithrain (hope i spelled that close to right) as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne. this is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating. the ending is left open for sequels and i sure hope that they consider doing more of these, for none have been bad. excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.<br /><br />p.s. the shaky cam did not hurt any of the action, but i still think we could do without it. the good news is, you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action.
