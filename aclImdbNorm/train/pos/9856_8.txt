(spoilers??)<br /><br />i wasn't sure what to think of the movie. not too much of a kids film. definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying. but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it.<br /><br />i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had. (even less without the credits) and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature. but alas, they torture him. right until the end of the movie. those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars. but i do recommend the movie. even for a sequel.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />quality: 9/10 entertainment: 7/10 replayable:7/10
