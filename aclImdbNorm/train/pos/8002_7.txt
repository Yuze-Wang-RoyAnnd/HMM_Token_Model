i have seen maslin beach a couple of times - both on free to air tv in brisbane. i won't go into whether it is good, bad or otherwise as others have well and truly covered this.<br /><br />i will say that it is so australian. only in australia can we have a film about relationships among people spending the day as naked as the day they were born, and to view it on free commercial television.<br /><br />i have a friend from the us who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free tv compared to her home country. sex and the city and huff are just too examples.<br /><br />despite our government trying to turn us into the 51st us state, it is good to know at least some things remain truly aussie
