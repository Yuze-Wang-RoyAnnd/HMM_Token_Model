according to the book the last of the cowboy heroes which is about joel mccrea, audie murphy, and randolph scott, the author says that albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost. hadn't been seen in years.<br /><br />good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at paramount because a print was apparently found and now it's out on the open market. albuquerque is a pretty good western too with scott involved in a family feud with uncle george cleveland.<br /><br />george cleveland sends for his nephew randolph scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business, headquartered in the fast growing settlement of albuquerque. cleveland is more than just a business owner, he's the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair. he even has the sheriff in his pocket. <br /><br />randolph scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing. that includes not backing relatives up when they're villains. he goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister russell hayden and catherine craig.<br /><br />cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western mata hari in the person of barbara britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals. barbara's great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda.<br /><br />randolph scott's original home studio was paramount, it was where his first studio contract was with. albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for paramount and they gave him a good one.<br /><br />note also lon chaney, jr., who is george cleveland's chief henchman, a rather loathsome bully of a man and gabby hayes, who is just gabby hayes.<br /><br />albuquerque must have been loved by republicans across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair. a certain democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone. they had high hopes of winning the white house that year too, but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in albuquerque. i'm not sure why cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot. my guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to.<br /><br />still albuquerque must have had great appeal to the gop market.
