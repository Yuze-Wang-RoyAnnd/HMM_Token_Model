i would like to know why john amos left the show, and how did he die off the show again? i couldn't relate to everything, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing. by the way, did they ever make it out of the ghetto? i think the episode with the black jesus was my favorite. we got to see them experience a few good times. something they didn't have very often. i wish they would bring the show back. during the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch. i don't think a movie or a new show would work. especially without the original cast. they are really what made good times goodtimes. these are my questions and comments. thank you!!
