looking for quo vadis at my local video store, i found this 1985 version that looked interesting. wow! it was amazing! very much a ken russell kind of film -quirky, stylized, very artistic, and of course "different." nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate, but as a wacky, unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career. he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of "leading" an empire -it wasn't much fun, and fun is what he longed for. klause maria bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth. yes, nero persecuted the christians with a vengeance; one of many who did so. at one point one of his henchmen murmurs: "no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves." he got that right.
