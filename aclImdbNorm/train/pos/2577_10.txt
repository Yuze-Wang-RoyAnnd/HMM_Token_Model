my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie (passing them down in the family if you will), and i loved it.<br /><br />clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it's up to superman to stop this mayhem.<br /><br />it's just so wonderful and fun to view. the old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology. george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid, and i'm 16 now, it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.
