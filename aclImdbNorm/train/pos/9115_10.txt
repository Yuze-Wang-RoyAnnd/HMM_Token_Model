the idea ia a very short film with a lot of information. interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more. the producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that i have seen. i have rated this film at the highest possible rating. i also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment. what comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to, their voice is never heard. it is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward. i hope that the produced will produce a second part to this 'idea'. i look forward to viewing the sequence. once again congrats to halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.
