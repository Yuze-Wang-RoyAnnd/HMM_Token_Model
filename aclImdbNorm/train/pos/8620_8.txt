i just finished watching the 139 min version (widescreen) with some friends and we were blown away. i won't bother repeating what others have said. what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. the huge battle is exhausting. afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained.<br /><br />there is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music/songs. blues, country/folk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter. it's hideous. you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded.<br /><br />there are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. there are many uses of silence as well as slow-motion photography that work beautifully. i really wish i could erase the music but alas.<br /><br />seek this out. it's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing.
