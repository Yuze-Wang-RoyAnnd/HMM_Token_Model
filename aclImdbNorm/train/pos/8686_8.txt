the second official episode of the "columbo" series ("murder by the book," filmed later, hit the airwaves first). robert culp, who would match wits with peter falk's detective in several future installments, is terrific as the short-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a client's wife when she refuses to cave-in to his blackmail schemes. the two stars are well-matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series.
