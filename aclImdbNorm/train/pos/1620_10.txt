so wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so italian. the film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. a kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? take your pick -- they're both faultless. let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass.
