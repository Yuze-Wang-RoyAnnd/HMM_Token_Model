this was the first movie i ever saw ashley judd in and the first film of victor nunez' that i ever say, and boy am i glad i did. its' quiet tone, its' relaxed pace, its' realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life, its' fine depiction of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark in life, the decisions she makes based on real things, the people she meets - there is nothing wrong with this movie. it is as close to movie magic as i have ever seen outside of the " star wars " movies, and, given what those films are like, that means this film deserves a high rating indeed. ashley judds' acting, mr. nunez'writing, and its' great simple worthwhile story make this a fine coming-of-age story and a wonderful movie.
