linking story: another first-time viewing for me and, again, this is one of the most popular of the amicus anthologies - and it's easy to see why, though i realize how the film's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some; i certainly fancied director peter duffell's choice - death and the maiden (which, incidentally, is a classical piece by schubert that is heard in the film during the peter cushing episode) - a great deal more. though the linking device itself is not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget duffell had to work with. the latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and, frankly, it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre (though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him).<br /><br />now to the individual stories themselves: <br /><br />"method for murder": the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but, to make up for this, it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times (tom adams' 'fictitious' villain looking like the long-lost brother of boris karloff from the old dark house [1932]); also, it ends with a satisfactory diabolique-type twist, and features a fairly intense role for denholm elliott in the lead. that's all we need out of it, really.<br /><br />"waxworks": for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film; peter cushing and joss ackland are both excellent (as well as impeccably dressed) in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time, and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death; an ominous hallucination scene with peter cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand, and ackland's inexplicable inability - or unwillingness - to leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats of bunuel's the exterminating angel (1962).<br /><br />"sweets to the sweet": this is perhaps the finest episode of all - with his ambiguous role here, christopher lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding nyree dawn porter and the deceptive innocence of chloe franks (who appears as lee's daughter). the film's treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature, culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain'. trivia note: chloe franks appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc, and when i saw her i felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldn't quite put my finger on it. later, on reading her filmography, it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of agatha christie's "the mousetrap" in london's west end, which my brother and i were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the summer of 2002! needless to say, we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrayal in sheer evil, mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile!! <br /><br />"the cloak": a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre, while inventing some new ones!) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and, at one point, christopher lee himself!; jon pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work; ingrid pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings; geoffrey bayldon (made up to look like ernest thesiger) also has a memorably quirky bit; the 'silent-cinema' style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience, i suppose - and, while some of the humor comes off as heavy-handed a' la the fearless vampire killers (1967) or theatre of blood (1973), it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high (and highly unusual) note! <br /><br />video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory, considering i had no other version to compare it with; the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one's enjoyment of the film. as for the extras, beginning with the audio commentary: frankly, this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that i can remember listening to; jonathan rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director peter duffell to touch on every aspect of the production (whereas with some other films, you're left rather expecting there to be more!) and, as such, it's an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed. the featurette "a-rated horror film" is a worthwhile effort with peter duffell again at center-stage but this time backed up with valid, if all-too-brief, contributions from producer max j. rosenberg and stars chloe franks, ingrid pitt and geoffrey bayldon. we also get film notes, reviews, bios and a poster/stills gallery which, again, are wonderfully assembled (with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty - and a welcome one at that).
