this movie is bufoonery! and i loved it! the "dragon lord" (jacky chan) and his buddy, "cowboy", totally made the movie fun, meaningful, and just plain silly. the movie is a rare blend of a good vs. evil fight and (somehow) the wonders and fun that is growing up. long shao ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragon lord" (so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy", which include implementing clever, elaborate ways to escape studying (with the help of the entire household, including the tutor), competing in rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to gain the affection of a local girl, competing in "soccer" (you will see what i mean) and the list goes on. somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people.<br /><br />the movie has its serious moments. but they do not depress, but rather inspire. the playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange, but is actually employed against evil. what i really loved about this movie is how it ends. not the typical confrontation (which in itself was awesome), but well, you'll see. let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie.<br /><br />silly, witty, meaningful, and nostalgic. great movie.
