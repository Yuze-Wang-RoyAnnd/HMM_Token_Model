this movie was excellent, a bit scary, but excellent at that. for those of you that have heard of columbine and know the story, it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did. in the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff, but you never realize just how bad it is, and this movie makes you realize. it's seriously that good. it also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone that's for sure. i read a book on the columbine massacre and it made me think, this movie makes me worry and scares me to death. on the downside it's like a how to kill someone guide for serial killers. i recently received a threat, and i blew it off thinking nothing of it, but after this movie i think you should take everything seriously. some people are crazy and you never truly know which they are, so take it seriously and don't under estimate someone.
