if you have seen dogtown and z-boys or have any interest in seeing the real, non-caricature, "real american" side of america then riding giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before.<br /><br />this film is "unreal", a facile term if ever there was one, but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100% factual documentary, but with all the drama of an opera, and the completely apparent sense of love, expert and knowing instilled by stacy peralta's direction and narration, this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeing.<br /><br />this film is a symphony, crafted as well as beethovens 9th, beginning beautifully with its prelude in hawaii, tugging deeply on human emotion in santa cruz and finishing with uproar, triumph and crescendo in laird hamiltons feats, again in hawaii.<br /><br />like classical music; like beethoven's 9th, ride of the valkyries or barbers adagio for strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. trust me.
