i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york. it was a pretty creepy movie, though not as good as horror hotel. i just bought this movie on dvd, and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french and/or italian and no subtitles are provided. then the other actors respond in english to what was being said. kind of weird. also on the dvd box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdb.<br /><br />aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth (barbara steele) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resists. that scene existed in the tv version, but it was very edited. i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. where are the master tapes and all the unused footage? <br /><br />aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. there aren't too many special effects (but herbert's face after julia clubs him is a good one). the creepy atmosphere and the strange, exotic, and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be. i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film, it would be a big zero. she makes the movie a ten!
