i've watched it plenty of times and i'm planning on buying the full feature. i love all of jason steele's comedy. it's very different and unique and is very enjoyable. i love indie films and this one is just great. the plot is strange but very funny. this short film is about a talking spatula named edward. the order of the events are a bit jumbled, making this film very interesting to watch. at first you see edward fighting the spoons, but then the focus changes to earlier in his life. this is a silly movie, but of course, it's still great. i highly recommend that you watch this film at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. it's very funny. the humour may not match everybody's taste but watch anyway. it'll only take 16 minutes of your time, and it's free. go watch spatula madness!
