a brilliant movie about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal, and love. macy is such a great actor. it was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with campbell, who looks the part of a neurotic sex object but doesn't have the chops to work with him on the level the script called for. but he's such a good actor that he played down to her level to make the scenes work. i highly applaud the casting of tracey ullman as the neglected wife. who knew? sutherland is also very good. the way he moves makes his character look taller (and even younger in some scenes). almost everyone knew what they were doing.<br /><br />macy's portrayal of the only situation in which his character is not able to be careful is nothing short of complete mastery.
