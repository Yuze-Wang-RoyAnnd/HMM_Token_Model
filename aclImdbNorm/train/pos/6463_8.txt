this is one of those movies that you keep thinking about when you wake up the next morning. it will give you that warm, fuzzy feeling and leave you with a smile on your face.<br /><br />sure, we get fed the typical stereotype characters and stories, but it does do the trick: entertain.<br /><br />being from sweden and living in the us for quite sometime, it is funny how we react. "the deadbeat husband is going to kill him", "she (gabriella) is going to die and then there will be a heartbreaking larger-than-life ending". we know how these things work, everything comes together at the end. and it did. the characters were somewhat simple, they were so elaborate that you didn't really think twice about it, nothing was really left for your own imagination. the closest would probably be siv, she makes you ask yourself if she indeed was in love with daniel, but that's about it.<br /><br />but the movie is beautiful, set in rural norrland, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are lovable. michael nyqvist is truly genius, with his crazy unique look and frida hallberg is charming and approachable. maybe a little too nice.<br /><br />but most of all this movie makes you feel, and that is the most important thing. you cry, you laugh, you hate and you identify. i don't know about you guys, but that does not happen that often.
