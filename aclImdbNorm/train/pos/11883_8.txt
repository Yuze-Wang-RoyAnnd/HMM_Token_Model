i saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it. i was very moved by this movie. i found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault. as in real life though sometimes people disappoint, as was the case with leo, who even though i liked his character i could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his hiv status. i was also disappointed with leo for rejecting the medicine available to him, and the awful way he treated marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train. i think this movie showed in a very real way why hiv numbers are up in young gay men. this is in no way meant to bash gays (i am gay) and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others. the only part of the movie i couldn't understand was why the (gay friendly) family was unwilling to include marcel in leo's illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral.<br /><br />i think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is do not have unprotected sex!
