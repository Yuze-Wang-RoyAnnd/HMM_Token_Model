1928 is in many ways a "lost year" in motion pictures. just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre, sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology.<br /><br />"show people" is one of the great silent era comedies. the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him, learns his lesson, and then redeems himself by winning the football game, the polo game, etc. this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane. she had excellent comic instincts and timing. this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies-like adventure of peggy pepper (marion davies) and her father, general marmaduke oldfish pepper, fresh from the old south. general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress. while at the studio commissary, the peppers run into billy boone (william haines), a slapstick comedian. he gets peggy an acting job. she's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick, but she perseveres. eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles. soon the new-found fame goes to her head, and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man, whom she doesn't really love, unless fate somehow intervenes.<br /><br />one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at mgm circa 1930. this film is one of those, as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy's autograph, an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself, and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot. peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her. truly a delight from start to finish, this is a silent that is definitely worth your while. this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible.
