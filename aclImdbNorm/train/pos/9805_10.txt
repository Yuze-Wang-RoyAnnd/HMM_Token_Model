'capital city' fans rejoice! this first season of this series is now available from network dvd and i've recently got my copy! although very much an ensemble piece of key 'maverick' trading floor characters 'capital city' does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line. the cultural mix (english, irish, american, german, polish) of head trader wendy foley's (played by joanna phillips-lane) group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms, interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and, to most people, seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast. in fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old-fashioned senior management of shane longman as represented by lee wolf (richard le parmentier) and james farrell (denys hawthorne). i suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by wendy's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive 'free spirit' peter longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy, relaxed modern way of business become a reality. to a certain degree wendy's (i am led to believe) immediate supervisor leonard ansen (john bowe) follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for wendy rather sees him occupying the 'middle ground' on most occasions. the main interest in the series, i believe, stems from the simmering romantic attraction between douglas hodge's declan and the cool self-assured blonde haired german trader michelle hauptmann (played by trevyn mcdowell) which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship/fondness that they undoubted have.<br /><br />looking forward to browsing through this title, and hopefully the second season of thirteen won't be too far away!
