i was entranced by this touching and hilarious film, not to mention surprised. i was also surprised to find that the voice of paulie was performed by jay mohr. the performance was so finely nuanced, neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the new jersey swagger, that i thought that this must be some unsung old pro, not the baby-faced mr. mohr. a very impressive performance, indeed, and it's gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky, indie films.
