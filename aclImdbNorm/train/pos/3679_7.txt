i just viewed the film two days ago, and i was filled with anticipation, being that paris is my second favorite city in europe and i spent a very romantic 18 months there in the '80's. i was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes, while original and artistically done, did not capture the "light" and beauty of the city very well.nor enough of the romance! we saw none of the tree-lined boulevards... there was too much darkness, not only literally but figuratively. some of the plots manipulated the viewer it seemed, and let him/her down "flat "(the marais sequence, the coiffure salesman sequence, to give two examples). the uplifting, good ones: the mime sequence, the cemetery, the montmartre (though it left too much to the viewer to comprehend), the "cowboy" vignette ,and the sacre coeur-- seemed few and far between, and i would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor as orlando bloom be in something that would have showcased his originality more.
