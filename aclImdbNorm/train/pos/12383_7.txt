christina raines plays a lovely model in new york who seeks out a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and herself slowly building up to quite a climax by film's end. this film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the roman catholic church vs. the devil, to the gateway to hell, to bizarre rituals, to a growing conspiracy, and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film. we get ava gardner, burgess meredith, chris sarandon, jerry orbach, deborah raffin, arthur kennedy, jose ferrer, slyvia miles, beverly deangelo, eli wallach, martin balsam, christopher walkin, william hickey, tom berenger, jeff goldblum, and who can forget john carradine as the old priest. many of these actors ham it up - particularly burgess meredith giving a fine comic/demented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat. meredith is memorable as is balsam and chris sarandon. some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like jose ferrer in a thankless role even if it is nothing more than a cameo. the sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes. the end scene is repulsive and yet chilling. i do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film, particularly that whole scene with deangelo and miles. was that really necessary? i think not. also, the father/daughter stuff was a bit much as well, but overall the film works and has a winning pace. director michael winner does a workmanlike job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments. the scenes with carradine are particularly effective.
