bill paxton, of aliens, near dark, and terminator fame, surprises me with his debut as director for frailty. he hits on all cylinders, but there is one implausibility near the end that involves the fbi agent (powers booth) which deducts a point from this otherwise chilling and thought provoking thriller. other than that, this movie was just fine.<br /><br />bill paxton plays dad. he's never given a first name, but that is not a weakness of the film. it in fact strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of some kind. he has a vision one day which he says was sent from god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons fenton meiks(matt oleary) and adam meiks (jeremy sumpter) must fine the demons and kill them. the demons look like normal people which they kill, and this makes the viewer wonder if dad has just lost his mind, or is he really doing god's work. there are scenes that reflect both points which adds to the confusion and gives the film more suspense.<br /><br />the story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up (matthew mcconaughey) and is speaking with fbi agent wesley doyle (powers booth) who is very skeptical and rightfully so. after all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.<br /><br />the film has many twists, and bill paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest. the acting is incredible. the two young leads and paxton work great together, looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder. like i said there is the one implausibility involving powers booth's character, but it really isn't a big thing. this was an extremely well made film involving faith and family.
