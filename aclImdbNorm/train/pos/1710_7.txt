this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan which was aired at least 15 years ago. the series was known as "gubbarre" meaning balloons. each episode was a new short story. the story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and "convincing" abhay doel does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a "normal" and "third class" guys(as he calls himself in the movie). in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the abhays role but shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off.<br /><br />i would suggest watching the series if it is available. it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction. the acting of the tv actors was much better than these "stars".<br /><br />the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour(or 45 minutes) story to 2+ hours. so it has to get draggy. even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up.<br /><br />this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original tv serial. the script and the ending of the serial was much better<br /><br />#####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him. he is aware and tell her that he doesn't want to be "repayed" and never helped with that intention. the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film. the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement. the deliver just wasn't right.<br /><br />but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy. no credit should be given to the director/scriptwriter. the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of premchand munshi. i am not sure if this is premchand munshi's story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi's and other great hindi writers stories.
