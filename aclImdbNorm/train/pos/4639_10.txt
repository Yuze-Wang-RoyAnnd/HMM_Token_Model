i got this one a few weeks ago and love it! it's modern, light but filled with true complexities of life. it questions and answers, just like other eytan fox movies. this is my favorite, along with jossi & jagger. this pictures a lot more, universally, than only the bubbles we may live in. you don't need to be jewish or homosexual to enjoy this - i'm not, but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies. at first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further. relationships we have to live with are superficial, meaningful, deep, fatal, you name it. you don't know what's coming, and you definitely don't know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time. it is worth seeing several times. fox movies include great bonus material - here a great music video and "the making of" (including explanation of the title, interviewing lior ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and arabs with doubts about the israeli life styles).
