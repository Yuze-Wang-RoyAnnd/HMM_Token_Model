some people loved "the aristocrats" and others hated it, frequently walking out in the middle. reactions to eddie izzard aren't likely to be that extreme -- if you can handle a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that makes, shall we say, enough use of the "f" word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television. many of izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances. on the other hand, i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzard's chest but also more often than not funny and, in spots, absolutely hilarious. he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines. he's not a story teller. he's not a joke maker. he's not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams. he plays around with ideas, some of which work and some of which -- a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz, for instance -- are completely unfunny. he has a way, however, of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect. i gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8. but a 10? no way.
