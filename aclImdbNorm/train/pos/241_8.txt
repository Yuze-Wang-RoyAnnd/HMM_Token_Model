i'm tired of people judging films on their "historical accuracy". it's a movie people!! the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story! there are a number of movies out there that aren't entirely accurate with the history....braveheart, wyatt earp, gangs of new york, geronimo: an american legend, the last of the mohicans....all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically. if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best, then i suggest you see this film and don't worry about the accuracy of the facts. just enjoy the quality of the film, the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time.
