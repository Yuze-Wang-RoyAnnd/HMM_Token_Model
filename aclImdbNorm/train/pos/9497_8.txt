absolutely fantastic trash....this one has it all: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosions etc. it also stars the wonderful belinda mayne as ingrid - not olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although olga turns into ingrid later on in the film (you'll have to watch it to see what i mean).<br /><br />i won't bother to go into the story as it's far too long winded and not very interesting. the relationship between ingrid and her brother bo (robert ginty) is interesting - watch the towel stealing scene to see what i mean.<br /><br />the fight scenes were at once quite good and then spoilt by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were done by the team who did city of the walking dead (i.e. strange coloured blood gushing out of neck wounds).<br /><br />i'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy - its pretty rare though and i couldn't ever see anyone bothering to re-release it so it'll become all the rarer in a few years.<br /><br />anyway i'd recommend it solely for belinda mayne's great nude scenes! that lady's a fox!
