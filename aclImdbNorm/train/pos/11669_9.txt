being the prototype of the classical errol flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in maureen o'hara (what an exquisite beauty!) and anthony quinn, i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure.<br /><br />hollywood at its best!
