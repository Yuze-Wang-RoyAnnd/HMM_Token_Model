this would have been so much fun to see in a theater, back in 1996. there is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies.<br /><br />"the dentist" is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters. maybe the ada launched a campaign against it, since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for "the marathon man" (which only has one scene comparable to the many in "the dentist").<br /><br />it's amazing to note that according to the trivia page, the movie was shot in 21 days. of course, post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for "the dentist" is picture perfect. the quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist "takes care" of his wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening. the rest is left to our very fertile imaginations! corbin bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically "off" characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist.<br /><br />for me the pacing of the movie was just right. the film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way. all of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office. there's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival. meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown! unlike so many movies of this genre, the script is very very tight. all the victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways. two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end.<br /><br />definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental-phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.
