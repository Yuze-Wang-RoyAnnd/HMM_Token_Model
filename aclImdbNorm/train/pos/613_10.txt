please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie!<br /><br />never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen. bold, because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided - a step to something new, creative and daring. just when you think 'oh, i've seen this before' or 'i am sure this is what will happen now' - stardust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story.<br /><br />the actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie. robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in. michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star', yvaine. other big names make outstanding roles. i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie. but once again, the story by neil gaiman, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply outstanding.<br /><br />i watched this movie at a pre-screening today, a day before the official release, and do hope it will have huge success. there is so much humor, but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes. the look in the eyes of yvaine, the 'frivolities' of captain shakespeare, the passion of lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettable<br /><br />for me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007, watch it and enjoy it<br /><br />11/10 - outstanding<br /><br />peace and love
