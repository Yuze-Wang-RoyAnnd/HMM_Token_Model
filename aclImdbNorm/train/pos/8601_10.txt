my observations: vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. jeanette wore it well, and got even with naive nelson. boat crashing into his balcony served him right. costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. 1942 costume designer did great job. main song theme just lovely.<br /><br />caution to negative posters: 1942 was time of ww ii; pearl harbor happened year before. u.s. just coming out of great depression; needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing, dance and yes, fantastic fantasy. despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in rl, snuffing out freedoms. thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend. movie going was a privileged treat, in those depressing times. when you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have room to talk and criticize. jeanette's and nelson's movies stand the test of time.<br /><br />angel wings wonderful, on the real angel. rl wings at costume party not so hot, but great on jeanette considering the sl.<br /><br />beautiful singing by jeanette and nelson, as always. jeanette dancing was a pure delight.<br /><br />15/10
