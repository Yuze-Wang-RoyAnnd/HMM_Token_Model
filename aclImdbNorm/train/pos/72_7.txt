i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies. price portrays don gallico, a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor). even though price is a murderer, i actually found myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him.<br /><br />although this movie doesn't have the "horror" factor of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite, "house of wax") it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest. <br /><br />this is a must for vincent price fans.
