i don't think i need to tell you the story. for it has been told for years and years. so i will just share my feelings. i first saw cinderella was when i was five years old. from then on i was a disney child in a good way. the animation now seems childish and old fashioned, but that is part of its charm now. now, in the age of high school musical and computer generated images, it seems like people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early disney movies. thankfully i was born before that so i was introduced to this classic. and it seems no matter how old i get, i turn back into that five year old watching it on vhs. which is the true magic of disney.
