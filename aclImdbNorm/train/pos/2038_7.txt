this film exceeded my expectations. i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish, so i wasn't expecting much. however, i was pleasantly surprised. at first i didn't take well to the lead girl and didn't really care if she lived or died. after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character. it's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason. there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film, but explains a lot. i would recommend this film to everyone. if you're not sure just watch it anyway, it's only an hour and a half of your life. you're going to live for 80 years anyway.
