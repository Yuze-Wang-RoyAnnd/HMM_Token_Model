it's hard for me to assign the "fair" number of stars to this film, but i settled on 8 because of its high production values and what was, in 1968, an innovative approach to the war film. remember too that i haven't seen it since 1969. but it did make a strong impression.<br /><br />the long day's dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made. it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern europe in 1944-45. no film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail, and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves. there is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios.<br /><br />unfortunately, there's no subtlety either. partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters come across as flat, familiar clich'e's. as "entertainment," the film doesn't make it, though it was clearly not intended to "entertain." it was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of world war ii and modern war in general. this was twenty years before platoon and thirty before saving private ryan, both of which are far more "watchable" films. here the flat and generally disagreeable characters, the lack of an actual plot, and the realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first on-screen vomit in theatrical history) make the film hard to sit through, though it is only 95 minutes.<br /><br />so, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when it's over, a bonus star for having its heart in the right place. average: 8.<br /><br />like carl foreman's underrated "the victors," an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought-provoking film, the long day's dying seems not to be on dvd. why not? both films have been on cable a number of times.
