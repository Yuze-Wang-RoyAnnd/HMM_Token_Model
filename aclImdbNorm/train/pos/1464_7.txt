more like psychological analysis of movies, but psycho does sound better as a header. the man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you will) does depict movies here in his own way. most of them are classics, but all of them are listed here at imdb and i'd strongly advise you to see them (especially the hitchcock movies, solyaris, conversation & and the lynch movies), because slavoj zizek will reference them! <br /><br />or in other words, he might spoil them for you. i don't remember if he spoiled more than those i've listed (i think the chaplin movies too), but as i wrote it'd be best if you watch them all beforehand! in the imdb listing there is a movie missing, that i did report to them, so it might get up there pretty soon. it's a meg ryan movie, but it's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways.<br /><br />zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to, if you're open minded to see things through another perspective (even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you ... it doesn't mean it will do that, but it could)!
