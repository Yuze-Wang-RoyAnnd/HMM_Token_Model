i have seen this movie many times and each time i watch it i can't help but be entertained by it. gunga din is one of those classic movies made in hollywoods golden years when the actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man made "monsters" to carry a scene. the onscreen charisma and comraderie demonstrated by cary grant, victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr. is suberb and very entertaining to watch. the tongue and cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works beutifully and flawlessly. some might consider it "corny" but i consider it "classic" filmaking and acting at its best. one must remember when watching this film that europe was involved in a war with germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always conquer over evil. gunga din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing escapades. in short, its a classic film that doesnt take itself too seriously and doesnt want the audience to either.
