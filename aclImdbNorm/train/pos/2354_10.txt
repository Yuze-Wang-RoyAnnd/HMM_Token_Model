it was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh, innovative, and original show. this makes every show i've ever watched look plain boring. the moment the first episode aired i was entranced and i became attached to all the characters so easy (which usually never happens because i always hate a few characters). it is a pity this show won't have a third season, because it has to be one of the best shows i have ever seen and that isn't exaggerating my feelings for the show at all. nothing can ever replace pushing daisies, because what could abc possibly find to replace this show? this is easily the best show on television. <br /><br />i came for kristin chenoweth and i stayed because i fell in love with the entire show.
