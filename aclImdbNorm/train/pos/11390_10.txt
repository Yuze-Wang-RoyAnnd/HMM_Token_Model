the story and music (george gershwin!) are wonderful, as are levant, guetary, foch, and, of course, kelly. one thing's missing, and that thing is a good leading lady. i'm sorry, leslie caron bothers me. anyway, despite her, the plot moves along nicely with the famous (and deservedly so) ballet. oh the colours, the dazzling reds, blues, greens, and yellows. musn't forget the beiges as well. ; ) i just adore the contrast between the beaux arts ball (completely black and white costumes) and the ever-so-brilliant ballet.<br /><br />so i suppose what i'm trying to say is this: please, by all means see it, and enjoy it, because though it isn't the best, it is marvelous. but be sure not to forget that other gene kelly musical with the 20 year old girl that was catapulted to stardom just afterward.
