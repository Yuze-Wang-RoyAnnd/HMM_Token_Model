i am amazed at how this movie(and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on imdb. the fanboy mentality strikes again. when this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. years later i sat down to watch this movie and i found myself enjoying. even laughing quite a bit. this and the replacement killers are the movies that had people labeling the director antoine fuqua as the black michael bay. i don't see how since most of fuqua's movies are smarter than anything michael bay has came up with. at any rate...<br /><br />story: alvin sanders(jamie foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense treasury agent edgar(david morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named bristol(doug hutchinson). alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. while these agents are after bristol, bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.<br /><br />jamie foxx is funny as well as great as alvin sanders. alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. doug hutchinson is okay as bristol. he can be over-the-top sometimes in his john malkovitchesque demeanor. he was better here than he was as looney bin jim in punisher: war zone. david morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. even mike epps is funny as alvin's brother stevie. both him and jamie had some funny moments on screen.<br /><br />the only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. the scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but i couldn't look away. the director went all out there so he gets points for that. plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.<br /><br />all in all bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. its never boring, its always funny and i wasn't checking my watch every minute. that should count for something. bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.<br /><br />ps: to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent.... how long have you been living under a rock? i'm pretty sure you've seen the die hard series and every movie by quentin tarantino. but those movies aren't violent right? weirdo.
