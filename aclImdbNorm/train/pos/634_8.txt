i was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film.<br /><br />stardust follows tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her. the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between england and a magical kingdom known as stormhold.<br /><br />this film was just a joy to watch, it has something in it for everyone, all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny. if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride, a classic.<br /><br />all the performances are outstanding, the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as larnia...but the performance to talk about is robert de niro...in every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show...<br /><br />if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film. guys don't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with claire danes and michelle pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout. the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film...nothing about the film seems forced.
