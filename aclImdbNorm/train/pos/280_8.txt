undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups. it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena. the game is set in ireland after world war one so don't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers.all the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on.our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time: he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left.so you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game! the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power p.c..level design is also cool and atmospheric. mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress. thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot (something very rare for a first person shooter) and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent. but the game has two main flaws. first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration.secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry. as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced. most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult. overall undying is a great game. definitely one of the best fps out there.
