the film belongs to inventor - underdog genre. jake gyllenhaal, laura dern and chris cooper bring a little acting verve to story with several standard elements. well filmed, well edited, with plenty of well acted secondary roles.<br /><br />some have declared this movie to be classic american hokey. it is that and more. i agree with those who say "the movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration." <br /><br />the film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots.<br /><br />
