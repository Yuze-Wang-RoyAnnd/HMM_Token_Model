as most off you might off seen star wars: return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m|might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one (live tv) when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi-wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader (real name: anakin skywalker) when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground
