the great and underrated marion davies shows her stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines. davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines. they appear in cheap comedies until marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star. a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretentions. davies & haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin, douglas fairbanks, william s. hart, john gilbert, elinor glynn, and marion davies (you have to see it) are a hoot. a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies!
