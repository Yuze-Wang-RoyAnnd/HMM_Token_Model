i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing. pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because, unlike thoroughbred jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /><br />yes, the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie, but it's also a very different movie. april love is light and easy to watch, a feel good movie. (disappointing though that pat boone's religious/moral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl! quite a change from today's standard fare.) home in indiana with walter brennan (filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song) captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment.
