take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. this was the premise of the show, simple yet outrageous & funny. leave it to fox to throw morality out the window & let the debauchery flow. it was like a real-life version of melrose place. the good thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving & manipulating each other for a cash prize. it was about lust & temptation, pure and simple & the ultimate test for a relationship.<br /><br />people either loved the show or hated it. it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident. you know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help but look. drama aside, there was a lot of eye candy.
