this movie stars jay leno as a detroit cop, tony costas and pat morita as a tokyo cop sent to detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor. a japanese man traveled to detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named derrick jarryd. unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. an angry derek jarryd tries to distance himself from phillip madras who led the men. but madras(played by chris sarandon) has none of it and threatens jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership. meanwhile in the same junk yard where the japanese man had been killed, a friend of tony costas was also killed by the same men. tony's friend had been watching the junk yard.<br /><br />tony sets out to find the killer against his superior's order. tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case. while tony is investigating the crime he runs into the japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him. eventually they end up working together on the case. they make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as pat morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking madras in the head. but it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie, at least in my opinion. jay leno is no actor, but he is likable in the role and pat morita is good as well. still, they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film. if you liked buddy cop films, cheesy 80's movies or you want to see jay leno as an actor then i recommend this movie.
