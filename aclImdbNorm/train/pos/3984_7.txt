as part of the celebration of the release of casino royale, this film with the new bond starring in it was shown, from director roger michell (notting hill). i almost turned it off for being a bit boring, but i'm glad i stuck with it. basically may (anne reid) is a single mother of helen (anna wilson-jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years. her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend, darren (daniel craig, of course). after knowing each other only a few days, may and darren have a secret affair. and at her age, with a 30-something, and the new bond?! anyway, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but may has regrets and wonders if helen will find out. when she does, darren gets less hassle than may. in fact, helen asks her permission to hit her. also starring peter vaughan as toots, danira govich as au pair, harry michell as harry, rosie michell as rosie and johnny english's oliver ford davies as bruce. very good!
