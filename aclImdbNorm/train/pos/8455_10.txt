while being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series, upon re-watching the series, i have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the gundam design, character design, and character depth are masterfully executed. while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts, the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art, with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters. consequently, it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character. personally, i liked heero because of his stoic personality. while i may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, i can objectively say that gundam wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we obtain peace?) while providing action packed battles in large robot suits, which, to say the least, is excellent.
