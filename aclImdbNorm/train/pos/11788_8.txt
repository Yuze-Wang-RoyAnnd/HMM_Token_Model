i really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one. first of all, i find this short-film very entertaining and interesting. i just take it for what it is. i think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher. one other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story, just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on. no-one else could have done that better than lynch. this is the essence of lynchianism at its best. sure, i will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer's side, will find themselves disappointed. and in good right. lynch is not about that. at least this side of lynch is not. the one that helped make lost highway/mulholland dr. is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else, will just not get what this is all about. my opinion is that darkened room is all about messing with your animal-core, your instinctual self, by giving you the means (image, sound, situation) by which you instinctively react. it's not about pleasure of any kind, it's about getting the desired reaction out of you. and, that, my friend, is pure art.
