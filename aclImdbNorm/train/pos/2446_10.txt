from the beginning of the show carmen was there. she was one of the best characters. why did they get rid of her?! the show not the same as before. its way worse.<br /><br />the best episodes were with carmen in them. you can't replace someone from the beginning! that is like south park without kyle or child's play without chucky! it's not right! the niece who replaced her is just, ugh! awful. she doesn't fit into the storyline at all. she was one of the main characters, and the niece can't replace her. she was an awesome actress. way better than the niece. get her back, or you'll lose a ton of viewers.
