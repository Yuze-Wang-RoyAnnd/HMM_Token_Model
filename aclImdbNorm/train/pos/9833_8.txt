a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon, and in the process of trying to escape, he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised. soldiers are able to retrieve the case, but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out. they eventually make it to where he's hiding, and "cleanse" the hotel and its occupants. unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation, and if you've seen return of the living dead, you know what happens next.<br /><br />zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike, as a complete mess of a movie. while that's a fair assessment, it's not without it's high points. for one thing, it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore-hounds happy. there's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible. they're in the water, the rafters of houses, hiding in trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush, only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape. there's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator. you have to see it to believe it, as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo. it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting, especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors i've seen, but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn't require anything more than your time and an open mind. zombi 3 fits that bill, and then some. it's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers, and watch it with some like minded friends. i give it an 8/10, just because of sheer enjoyment.
