for the longest time, i liked this movie better than the original care bears movie. well last summer, i watched them both together and decided i was wrong. the first one is a better care bears movie (as you may have guessed if you read my review for it). this one isn't a bad movie, it's just... very strange.<br /><br />well first of all, as a few people have mentioned, it completely disavows any knowledge of the first movie. i can't think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly (especially with the genders of some characters and how they all met). when i was little and watching this, i was quite a bit confused and distraught. i felt the same way watching it as an adult!<br /><br />on to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good (if you disassociate it from the first movie). i can't think of another movie for little kids with a demon as it's villan! now i am not for a minute suggesting that evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and care bears are good, i just find it cool that there's a supremely evil being in a movie for little kids! it's like that bizzare "santa clause vs. satan" movie from mexico you hear about sometimes. <br /><br />anyhow, the demon's name is darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the care bears in return for him giving her special powers. very dark for a kiddy flick eh? and did i mention that darkheart appears to the girl most often as a whiney voiced 10 year old boy??? freaky! meanwhile some other kids are in care-a-lot looking after baby care bears! oh, man! demons and baby care bears in the same movie!!!!!<br /><br />needless to say, everything gets cleared up in the end (but not before we get to see darkheart trap the care bears' souls in this scary chandelere thing in one [surprisingly] deeply disturbing scene). but i am left with the question of wether this movie has found the cult audience it so richly deserves. i might just watch it again myself.
