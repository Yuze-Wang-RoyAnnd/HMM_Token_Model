cecil b. demille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western comes across as the real mccoy, engrossing, entertaining, spectacular; in no way outdated.<br /><br />as a real fan of tv's deadwood, i'll tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor as calamity jane are far more on-target.<br /><br />we don't have any giants in hollywood anymore. plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade: released, re-issued, re-issued all over again. filmmakers like today's spielberg, jackson, bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox. none of today's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years.
