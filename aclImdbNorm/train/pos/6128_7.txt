yes this a b- grade horror. but at least the producers, directors, and cast does not pretend this flick is manna from heaven. the plot is corny, a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is splashed with genetic acid turning him into a snow man. the snowman a.k.a. jack frost then goes on a murdering rampage to find the small town sheriff that finally arrested him. with a limited budget the crew had to make do with limited special effects, most of the money appears to spent on the snowman's costume. particullary difficult shots are managed by cartoons or pan away shots (shots where the camera moves away to disguise the details). <br /><br /> this is no kid's movie and should not be confused with disney movie of the same title. if you do not let your children watch pg-13 movies alone than parents should not let their kids watch this movie. this movie has two claims to fame. 1. the beatiful shannon elizabeth (american pie)did her first major movie role. the scene where jack frost attacks shannon elizabeth is worth watching a few times. 2. this movie has the worst snowman joke ever. the joke is so bad that the directors credit the joke teller in the credit list.
