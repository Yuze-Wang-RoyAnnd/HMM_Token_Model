this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen: i glowed inside throughout the whole film. the music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen. the slow pace was set by the mode of travel (a riding lawn mower with a big trailer) and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow-paced lives of the other characters.<br /><br />the story actually happened; alvin straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. there was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters. sissy spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead, always wanting to do the right thing. richard farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became alvin straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across iowa to visit his estranged brother, lyle, who has had a stroke. alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way.<br /><br />the film underscores the importance of family to this man and, hopefully, to all of us. i eagerly anticipate seeing it again, and again. directed by david lynch, this films proves his directorial skill. farnsworth was nominated for an academy award for best actor; at 79, he was the oldest nominee ever for that award.
