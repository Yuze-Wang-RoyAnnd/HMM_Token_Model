no strings attached features carlos mencia doing stand-up that makes us both laugh and think. not only does he poke fun at racial issues (like many haters claim), but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country...what women mean when they say they want to be treated equally...why americans are crazier than arab terrorists...why nobody needs to pray for the pope - and what he hopes he's doing in heaven...a theory of how easter (aka big ups to jesus day) traditions got started...his viewing of the movie passion of the christ - and his sub-sequential argument with a woman about whether or not he's affected by jesus...how society should treat the physically handicapped...and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not.<br /><br />also, he never stops reminding us that each of us has a voice. so we should use it to speak the truth, say what we think, and not be afraid if others are offended.<br /><br />carlos is the bomb.
