"the mother" is a weird low-budget movie, touching at least two uncomfortable themes not usually explored in the cinema: denial of love of mother for their own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third age.<br /><br />the characters are awful: may is a disgusting old lady and i believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her. she confesses that she did not love her son and her daughter. she cheated her husband twice with an intellectual. she steals the beloved man of her daughter, not to protect her from a guy without moral, that does not love her, but just because she feel horny with him. she is trying to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter delusions. paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser, who accepts her life the way it is. her brother bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife, who insists in having her shop, a terrible business indeed. darren is an amoral addicted jerk who does not like anybody, even himself.<br /><br />the acting and direction are excellent: the actresses and actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very precise. i liked this movie, but i recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences. my vote is seven.<br /><br />title (brazil): "recomecar" ("re-start")
