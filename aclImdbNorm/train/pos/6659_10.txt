it takes guts to make a movie on gandhi in india ,in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong.this movie shows how a mahatma failed to be a decent father(at least in the eyes of his son). <br /><br />the performances are terrific ,the cinematography fantastic, the direction fabulous,but the film drags.if the intention was to make this movie without any box-office expectations,which i assume is the case here,then its a brilliant attempt,but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success,then the film's fate was doomed the day they chose this subject..<br /><br />20 yrs from now,this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of harilal by akshaye khanna.he deserves an oscar nomination for this one..and honestly,his is not the only performance worth applauding, shefali chhaya is terrific too..<br /><br />watch the scene where harilal hears about his father's death.no dialogues,no screaming,but a speechless shot by khanna.its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of cinema<br /><br />gandhi,my father is not at all exciting cinema but yes,its excellent cinema and a must watch.brilliant attempt..
