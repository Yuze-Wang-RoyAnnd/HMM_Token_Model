i loved october sky. the thing i loved most had to be the music. it worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. this is done by playing songs from the late fifties. in the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. the music now fits the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />i did not only enjoy the music, i also quite enjoyed the cast. jake gyllenhaal as homer hickam was especially a surprise for me. he gave off a first-class performance, as did chris owen (quentin) and chris cooper (john hickam).<br /><br />i've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times i thoroughly enjoyed myself.
