although i was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school (1996) when i saw it i became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them.<br /><br />their hair, clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar! i remember thinking how real it was and how i wished that they would make movies like that still.<br /><br />in fact i saw this movie the night after i had been at a crazy party (not so unlike the one in jay's house) which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd. a world class bs'er and "responsible" mother figure type i identified immediately with jeanie (i was also the one with a car) although i had a little bit of madge's insecurities floating around in there too. my best friend was a deidre and her good friend from childhood was our annie.<br /><br />watching the scene when jeanie is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations i had personally had.<br /><br />now at the age of 27 i recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth (though none of my friends died). i think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up.
