i saw his movie in dallas, texas when it came out in 1986. i remember them giving out prizes for showing up to see the movie. after seeing the movie i can see why. the movie was not bad, nor was it great. the problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story. they created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap it around the masters saga. my biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of robotech masters attacking the earth. they even used the same scenes from the master saga but with different dialogue. as a kid, i loved the movie. but unfortunately i haven't seen it as an adult and can't give a better review. looking back i was disappointed but now i would love to see the movie and re-evaluate my stance on it. that being said, will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge? i love robotech and can't wait for the shadows chronicles.
