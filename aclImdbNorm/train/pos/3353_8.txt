this film makes a strong comment about the italian people of the time. the use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and i can't not mention the beauty and magnificence of sophia loren and mastroianni. i love them both. their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you may question whether or not the camera is actually there. the husband, in his brief role, is also excellently portrayed as the fascist italian who commands his wife and children but, in his own way, a loving father. the beginning scenes with hitler at piazza venezia with all the italians is incredible and really places the film historically. i loved the film and i also agree that it is funny it isn't more renowned.
