war drama that takes place in louisiana in 1971. it follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then tigerland--an accurate portrayal of vietnam on american soil, before they're shipped over. it focuses on two men--booz (colin farrell) and paxton (matthew davis)...how they meet, become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader (clifton collins jr.) and a borderline psycho (shea wingham).<br /><br />a surprisingly non-commercial film directed by joel schumacher. he uses a hand-held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes. it works very well--the film looks gritty (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic.<br /><br />farrell successfully covers up his irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing southern accent. his performance is just superb--he's an extremely talented young man. davis, unfortunately, is not that good. he's tall, muscular, very handsome--and very bland. the rest of the cast however is just great.<br /><br />this film was thrown away by its studio. it had no stars in it, a familar story and was considered "just another war film". it only played a week in boston! it's well worth catching on video or dvd.<br /><br />also, farrell and davis have a lengthy nude scene.
