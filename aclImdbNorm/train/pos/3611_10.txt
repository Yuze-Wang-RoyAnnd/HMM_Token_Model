i saw this movie after i saw blue crush and other of michelle's movies, i thought she had a bleak future in this business.i was extremely wrong after watching her performance in "girlfight" i was amazed in the way she captures the emotion of one a fighter, but also a warrior.in this movie the way she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother, the way she conveys anger when getting hit.her characters learning curve in the movie of she cant always put up a wall and hide from love, or that just because she has power she wont win.i believe this role was fit perfectly for michelle even though she had no prior experience, the director saw talent, i criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her.
