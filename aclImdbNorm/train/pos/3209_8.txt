interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to. however, i'll try. this was a very good action film with some great set pieces. you'll note i specified the genre. i didn't snipe about the lack of characterisation, and i didn't berate the acting. enjoy if for what it is people, a well above average action film. i could go on but i've made my comment.
