hidden frontier is notable for being the longest running internet-based star trek fan series. while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like starship exeter, or new voyages, hidden frontier concentrates largely on story, and in that regard it does very well indeed.<br /><br />hidden frontier has no physical sets; instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen, and the backgrounds inserted digitally. one of hidden frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced. one of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming, instead of in post-production. while this does save a great deal of time, it's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production, though it still serves its purpose. <br /><br />while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, hidden frontier is well worth a shot, though you might be best to start off watching the third season, since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride.
