panic is a sneaky little gem of a film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great pleasure, that henry bromell is a much better writer/director than that. <br /><br />the film builds slowly, with one quietly devastating scene after another, all enacted perfectly by william h. macy, donald sutherland, neve campbell, tracey ullman, john ritter, and the most remarkable child actor i've seen in a long time, david dorfman, as macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind. rich and rewarding, this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
