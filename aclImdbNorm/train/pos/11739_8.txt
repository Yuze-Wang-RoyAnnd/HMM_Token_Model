"elvira, mistress of the dark" is a sort of "harper valley p.t.a." with touches of the supernatural. elvira (cassandra peterson) walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new station's owner gets fresh with her. she's now relying on a las vegas show to carry her through, but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started. things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunt's death, which then takes elvira to massachusetts for the reading of the will. a house in need of repairs, a dog, and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt, and again it seems elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the las vegas show. the adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for elvira. only the local hunk (daniel greene), and a group of teenagers will befriend her. elvira's uncle "vinnie" (w. morgan sheppard), presses to make a deal with elvira for the cookbook, but elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting, and a couple very effective casseroles. elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power. elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town's old charge of witchcraft, and the showdown between her and her uncle. the plot is pretty simple, but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace. "elvira, mistress of the dark" is full of cute, gross, bawdy, and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags, puns, props, songs, and parodies. the film's touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. it is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers; including edie mcclurg, and jeff conaway (of "grease.") there are also nice special effects. many people (including myself) wondered if the elvira character could carry a feature film, and the answer is delightfully, yes!
