i loved this film. i thought it would be easy to watch, and easy to forget. i ran out after watching this to buy the dvd, obv not easily forgotten!<br /><br />the script is brilliant, and the casting couldn't be more perfect. each character has their moment, and i laughed hard throughout this film, comedic timing was spot-on.<br /><br />
