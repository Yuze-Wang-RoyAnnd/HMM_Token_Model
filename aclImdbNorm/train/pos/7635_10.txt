i have seen this movie plenty of times and i gotta tell ya, i've enjoyed it every single time. this is belushi's pinnacle movie in my opinion. belushi and lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you can't help but get involved once you start watching. the movie has a wonderful cast of stars, some already were big, and others were just getting started. it's billed as a feel good movie, and that's exactly what it is. this movie teaches you that life isn't always so bad after all. sometimes you've just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. when you're done watching, you'll appreciate the things you have a lot more and you'll also be smiling. you can't ask for much more from a movie in my opinion, not to mention it's a hilarious movie and you'll never lose interest. very very underrated movie here folks.<br /><br />rating from me: 10 i am out!!!
