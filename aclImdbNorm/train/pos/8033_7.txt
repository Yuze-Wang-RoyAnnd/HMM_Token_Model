zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. i don't typically go for military/war movies, but this was worth my time.<br /><br />it was serious, but it was also humorous. beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest. no matter what, you know that he's got your back.<br /><br />zane's character developed throughout the film. he wasn't just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun.<br /><br />the ending through me a little though. it didn't really go with the action throughout the film, but i'm glad that i saw it, nonetheless.<br /><br />it's worth checking out.
