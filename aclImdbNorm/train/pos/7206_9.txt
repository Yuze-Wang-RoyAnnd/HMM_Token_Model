excellent plot within a plot within a plot. shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog. must be my upbringing:)<br /><br />very well acted by all. you never quite know who's going to out-do who. the last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just deserts.<br /><br />recommend to all. a harmless, tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably michael caine's over-use of the word "bloody", but that's his signature, isn't it.<br /><br />9/10
