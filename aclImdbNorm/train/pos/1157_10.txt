this is one of the best comedy ever ! the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast, well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great. if you're a kevin kline fan, he does (as always) an fantastic performance, and robert downey jr is perfect. if you don't laugh while seen this movie, you don't have any sense of humor.
