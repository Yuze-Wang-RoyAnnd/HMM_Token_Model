henri verneuil represented the commercial cinema in france from 1960-1980. always strong at the box-office, and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies, mafia score-settling and world war ii battles, verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on saturday night. he worked with the cream of the male actors of his day: gabin, belmondo, fernandel, delon, sharif, anthony quinn. i... comme icare is the only time he directed yves montand. it's an oddly static film, taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms, containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence.<br /><br />montand gives a good performance, if somewhat dry, and he is well supported by the other actors. i couldn't help wondering what costa-gavras could have done with this story, on the basis of z (the lambrakis assassination) and l'aveu (the torture of artur london in czechoslovakia by stalinists).
