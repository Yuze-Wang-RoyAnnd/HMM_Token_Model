the town of royston vasey is a weird, but wonderful place. the characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works, and it works very well. most people will know others with a touch of some characters, but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as tubbs and edward, the stranger-hating owners of the local shop, or the pen-obsessed pauline who treats "dole scum" with much contempt.that was only a few of the strange inhabitants. the tv works consists of 3 series and a christmas special. there are references to many horror films, such as the wicker man. a more recent addition to the range of works is a film, the league of gentlemens apocalypse, of which i will not say much but highly recommend. all in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters. i would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it!
