magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish, thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars. alan arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades. like any really fine film, it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming. i can't believe this film is so difficult to find -- i'd buy it on dvd in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet.
