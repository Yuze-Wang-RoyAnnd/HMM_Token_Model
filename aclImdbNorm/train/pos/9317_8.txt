i've seen this film criticized with the statement, "if you can get past the moralizing..." that misses the point. moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder, as it were. this is a decent film with a standard murder mystery, but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through. the resolution leaves the viewer wondering, "what would i have done in this position?" and i have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker intended. to that end, and to the end of entertaining the audience, the film succeeds. i also like the way that the violence is never on stage, but just off camera. we know what has just happened; it's just not served up in front of us, then rubbed in our faces, as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing. besides, the violence is not the point. the point is the protagonist's moral dilemma, which is cleverly, albeit disturbingly, resolved.
