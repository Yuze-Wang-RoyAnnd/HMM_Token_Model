in the old commercial for blank audio cassettes, the tag line was "is it real or is it memorex?" the same might be said for the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of "the cage," the first pilot of star trek. mr. spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet talos iv in order to allow capt. christopher pike, his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed, to return there. why the finagling? because to have any contact at all with talos iv invites a death sentence. why this is so is never explained - that bothered me tremendously - but, if nothing else, it adds to the story. after he has gotten the ship to travel to talos iv, mr. spock turns himself in to dr. mccoy (the senior-most officer present; capt. kirk was off the ship) for arrest and says, "the charge is mutiny, dr.; i never received orders to take over the ship." what follows is a court martial in which - thanks to the talosians - we learn why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) for capt. pike to get to talos iv even at risk of mr. spock's death. the illusions the talosians create, the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic. and meg wyllie as the keeper (the head talosian) is wonderful. call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect! the talosians, having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can't really tell if they're male or female and it really doesn't matter. this episode, more than almost any other in the series, makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced! what a neat thing if this were so! this is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times i've seen it (i even have it on video), it never fails to fascinate me. meg wyllie looks like an alien and i do not mean that unkindly.
