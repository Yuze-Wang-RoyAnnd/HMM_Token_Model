sunday would not be sunday without an action movie, and when you want intense combat, you turn to tom berenger (platoon).<br /><br />here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords. life's a bitch, so he gets a green office type (billy zane) to help on the mission.<br /><br />the film is in the hands of luis llosa, who stunk up anaconda. he doesn't do much better here, but berenger makes the movie worthwhile.<br /><br />sure, it may be a little long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but is is good, tense action when the time is right.
