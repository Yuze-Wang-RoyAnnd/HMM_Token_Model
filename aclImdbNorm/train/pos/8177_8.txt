i'm surprised no-one has thought of doing a movie like this before. horror is often most effective when it uses real life unpleasantness as a theme. and nobody (except for steve martin in the little shop of horrors) likes going to the dentist. tooth torture has been done before (see the marathan man for example), but this brings the terror into suburbia.<br /><br />the plot revolves around a dentist, dr. alan feinstone (corbin bernsen), who descends into madness. now our dear doctor wasn't playing with a full deck to begin with, but driven by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder he begins to reek havoc on those around him. the doctors spiraling mental condition is kinda close to what we see in micheal douglas's character in falling down, but with a horror edge.<br /><br />written and directed by horror stalwarts stuart gordon and brian yuzna, its witty and has a great flow. also featured playing a cop, is the ever welcome ken foree.<br /><br />now i believe this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance from corbin bernsen. having really only seen him in la law before, i was blown away by his acting.<br /><br />the sequel the dentist 2 is also worth watching, but slightly under par compared to the original.<br /><br />ttkk's bottomline - a fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe, capped (pun intended) by a great performance from bernsen
