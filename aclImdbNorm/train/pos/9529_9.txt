this is one of the best made movies from 2002. maybe it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by sam mendes, who debuted with 'american beauty'.<br /><br />it tells the story of a gangster named michael sullivan (tom hanks) who is seen by his son (tyler hoechlin) on one of his jobs. michael's boss, john rooney (paul newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son connor rooney (daniel craig) sets both his father and michael up, leading to the death of michael's wife (jennifer jason leigh) and second son. michael thinks rooney is responsible and rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man harlen maguire (jude law) to finish the job. since michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss frank nitti (stanley tucci).<br /><br />in a way 'road to perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. this movie is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. all these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. that hoechlin is not a annoying kid and hanks, law and newman know how to act helps, of course.<br /><br />based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre. sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. the scenes between the adult hanks and the child hoechlin help in that area. see this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.
