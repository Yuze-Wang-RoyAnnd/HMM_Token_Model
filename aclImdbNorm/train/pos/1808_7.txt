all dog's go to heaven is an animated kid's movie like no other. gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all prominent in the plot, and though kids will get very little of it, adults will be scratching their heads as to why this movie was made to feel like some sort of gangster movie. the actual movie isn't explicit in any way, it's just an odd combination to make a kid's movie on.<br /><br />charlie barkin (burt reynolds) is a player dog, who owns half a casino with his partner carface (vic tayback). after getting drunk (a dog....getting drunk...in a kid's movie. it just sounds weird.), charlie is tricked and murdered by carfax. when in heaven, he finds a way to come back to earth, but he will no longer be allowed in heaven. he still goes back to earth and meets up with his old friend itchy (dom deluise), and plans payback on carfax. meanwhile, carfax has a little orphan girl anne marie held captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals, which helps predict races. charlie and itchy free her, and try to help her find a family, while learning a lot about themselves.<br /><br />this movie is one of the few non-disney that will appeal to both kids and adults. kids will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation, while adults will enjoy the nice, sweet plot, and the more than normal developed characters. one thing that keeps this down, is that it's a musical. normally, that's a good thing, but the music here is honestly terrible. they tend to jump around, almost sounding ad libbed, with next to no instrumental backing. in fact, these are probably the worst songs i've ever heard in an animated movie, but luckily, the rest of the film is strong enough to not fall apart because of some bad notes.<br /><br />the ending of this movie works, but i honestly hate it. it's sad, but happy, but more sad than happy, and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel. considering how bad the sequel made to this was, i wish the ending wouldn't have warranted a sequel and it would've wrapped up into a nice, super happy ending. this is one of the few movies i feel this way about, but i do.<br /><br />overall, this is a nice family film, with odd themes thrown in, but nonetheless, good entertainment.<br /><br />my rating: *** out of ****. 85 mins. g.
