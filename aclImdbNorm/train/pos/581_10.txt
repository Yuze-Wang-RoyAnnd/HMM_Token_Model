a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated. the acting is wonderful and understated, with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning. brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father. the movie moves like a river, you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows, but it is well worth it in the end.
