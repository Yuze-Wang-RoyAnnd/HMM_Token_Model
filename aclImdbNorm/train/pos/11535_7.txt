bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' movie certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts. the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons; - a sin that's virtually unacceptable in most post-halloween genre pieces. but there's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect. just as wally koz's surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family, mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director. looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature. but despite fairly good distribution across the globe, the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market. nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down
