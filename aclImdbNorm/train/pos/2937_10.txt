i know it's crude, and i know that it isn't at all pc, but it's so funny. if you can put it into perspective that it's from the early 80's and it carries all the stereotypes of the time--and the movie still makes you almost pass out with laughter--than it is truly a good comedy. going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the subject matter of this film is exagerated. if you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half, just to have an all-out laugh, than please watch this.<br /><br />p.s. would someone please put this out on dvd, it's so hard to find on vhs anymore.
