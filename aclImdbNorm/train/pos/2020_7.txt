contains spoilers!<br /><br />i saw an advert for this on a video.then my sister discovered that we had the book so i read it.i rented the video on the same day i finished the book.i thought it was very memorable as was the book. the cast was brilliant.tara fitzgerald was excellent as helen and rupert graves was hateful as arthur.the costumes,music and settings are stunningly beautiful.<br /><br />warning!don`t read any more if you haven`t watched this<br /><br />on the downside there are some sex scenes that have been added in and some violence.this is why the video is rated 15. there are some other things that have been thrown in.after the first part,i felt that the accuracy went downhill. while the book is better than this,i am glad i have seen it and would reccomend it to people who have read the book,are fans of bronte or like costume dramas(i am all 3!)as long as you fastforward through the sex scenes. the book is rather underated.anne brontes books don`t seem to be that widely read or well known as jane erye or wuthering heights which have made it into television and film several times. another thing.when i read the book ,i was surprised at how much religion ther was in it,but here they had axed that all out!<br /><br />7\10
