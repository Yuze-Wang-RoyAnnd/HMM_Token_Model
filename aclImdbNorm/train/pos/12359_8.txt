notable because of it's notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous maruschka detmers takes her young lover's penis from his trousers and into her mouth. even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride. detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged, insatiable delight, wandering about her flat nude. dressed, partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. for me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fianc'e is released whilst fellow terrorists are released, she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps, beautifully of course!
