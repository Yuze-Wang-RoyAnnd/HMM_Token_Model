i saw this at a screening last night too. i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected. not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion.<br /><br />i won't bother rehashing the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better. but i will say that adam sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. he was funny, and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies. don cheadle was believable as always.<br /><br />this movie isn't funny like borat or billy madison but it has a good pace about it. i'd say 90% of the audience laughed for most of the film. midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together.<br /><br />i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend/white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.
