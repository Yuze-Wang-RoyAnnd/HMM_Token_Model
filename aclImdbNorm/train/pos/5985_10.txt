god i love this movie. if you grew up in the 80's and love heavy metal, this is the movie for you. they really don't get much better than this. the fastway soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever. i put on the record when it first came out and spent the next month learning every song on guitar note for note. the plot outline is your standard heavy metal horror movie. kid's favorite singer dies. kid plays record backwards. hero comes back in demonic form and rocks the town. what more could you ask for?<br /><br />if you haven't seen it yet, rush out and buy it. you will not be disappointed. metal rules...
