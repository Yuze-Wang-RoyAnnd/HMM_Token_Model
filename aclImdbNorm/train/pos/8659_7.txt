in a way, this film reminded me of "jumping jack flash". remember whoopi goldberg at the shredding machine? whoopi zonked out tranquilizers? whoopi as blind lemon and imitating mick jagger? great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks, right? that's how i feel about "rich in love". a man hears his wife sing for the first time. post-coital teenagers talk about the nature of love. albert finney eats ice cream out of bucket and, in another scene, has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife. alfre woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe. but there's only the whisper of a plot here and you can't wait for it to get moving. only when ex-go-gos' charlotte caffey's the graces revs up a great pop song does the picture wake up...and then it's over!<br /><br />this picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer's day in the deep american south.
