la teta y la luna is a symbolic spain film. everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning. it is totally different to the usual movie that one has access.<br /><br />this film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the film's tale. i must advice that this is not a sample film.<br /><br />please enjoy!!!
