the unflappable william powell. he is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world. he always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him. the murders are projects, barely human beings. i have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit. other than an occasional weeping widow, the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists. nothing more. there are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and powell is a master at this. there is a lot of political incorrectness, especially as it relates to the asian performers. this is a little hard to take. the cast is great, and curtiz's direction is also a consistent asset.
