i can't believe it's been ten years since this show first aired on tv and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror. this is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern british humor: dr. terrible's house of horrible; garth marenghi's darkplace; the mighty boosh; snuff box. many have imitated this show's style, and i don't deny some have surpassed its quality. but jermy dyson deserves being remembered for having started the trend, with actors mark gatiss, steve pemberton, and reece shearsmith.<br /><br />together they created royston vasey, a sinister small town in england's idyllic countryside, where unsuspecting tourists and passers-by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers; where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center; where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows; where a vet kills all the animals he tries to cure; where a gypsy circus kidnaps people; and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people on.<br /><br />this is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in the league of gentlemen. by themselves, the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters. the make up and prosthetics are so good i actually thought i watching a lot more actors on the show than there were. but it's also great acting: the way they change their voices and their body movement, the really become other people.<br /><br />most of the jokes start with something ordinary, from real life, and then blows up into something unsettling, sometimes gut-wrenching. sometimes it's pure horror without a set up, like in papa lazarou's character. just imagine a creepy circus owner on make-up barging into someone's house and kidnapping women to be his wives. no explanation given. it's that creepy. then there are the numerous references to horror movies: se7en, the silence of the lambs, nosferatu, the exorcist, etc.<br /><br />fans of horror will love it, fans of comedy will love it. as any traveler entering knows, there's a sign there that says 'welcome to royston vasey: you'll never leave.' any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree. once you discover the league of gentlemen, you'll never want anything else, you'll never forget it.
