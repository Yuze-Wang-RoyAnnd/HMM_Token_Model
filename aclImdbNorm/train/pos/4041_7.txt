tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. when he survives electrocution the government officials give him a choice to either be electrocute at a greater degree or agree to some experiments. he chooses the experimentation and is placed in a large metallic cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the electrocution. they can have whatever the want in the room (within reason), but they can't leave. after a few days there meals are cut down to one per day and the room temp is set up too 100. after some more alarms are sounded at intervals so they can't sleep. one day a 'witch' come into their cell (albeit a glassed off portion) what happens next i'll let you find out. i may be in the minority here but i liked the build up, it was intriguing to me. now if the payoff was half as good as the build up was i would have rated this so much higher.<br /><br />my grade: c+ <br /><br />media blaster's 2 dvd set extras: disc 1) director's cut; trailers for "versus", "aragami", "attack the gas station", and "deadly outlaw rekka" disc 2) theatrical cut; commentary with hideo sakaki, ryuhei kitamura, sakaguchi takuand tsutomu takahashi; cast and crew interview; making of; original trailer; and promo teasers
