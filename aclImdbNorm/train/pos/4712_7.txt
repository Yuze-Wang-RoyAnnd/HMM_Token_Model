the jokes are obvious, the gags are corny, and the characters are walking characatures - but i couldn't stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie. no matter how many times i see it, i still get a kick out of this one, and i recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment. it contains many quotable moments, and some of the best sight-gags i've seen to this day. if you've had a bad week and you need a chuckle, rent this one on your way home friday night to give your weekend a good start.
