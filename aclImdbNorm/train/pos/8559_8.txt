there is a certain genius behind this movie. i was laughing throughout. the scene in the phone sex office, discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius/humor. execution is poor, but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent. the doppelganger split at the end was like... "ok, wasn't quite expecting that but let's see what the movie has to say". certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way.<br /><br />is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level? i'm easily bored by many movies, but this one kept my interest throughout.<br /><br />i think the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. horribly bad, but good. i'm looking for other movies this person may have done (with more experience).
