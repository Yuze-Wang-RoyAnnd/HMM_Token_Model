i love sabrina! its one of my fave shows!! my favourite episodes are; the one where she turns libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series. i do think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones but they were better than the last series which was awful. valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than jenny, but jenny was in some brilliant episodes. hilda and zelda were amazing, and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went! libby was a good character too. i never liked morgan or roxy, they just weren't as good as her other friends.
