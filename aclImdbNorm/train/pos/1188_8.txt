i was initially dubious about this movie (merely because of the subject), but the richly drawn characters, the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt, and the dramatic conclusion make it well-worth watching. i initially had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters but as the movie progressed they increasingly distinguished themselves. i am still haunted by the final scene.
