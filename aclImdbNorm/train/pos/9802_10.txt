for starters i have always been a fan of the batman cartoons because the theme is so universal, 'that everyone alive has an alter-ego'. this is true in the mystery of batwoman. while the overall story is good i'm disappointed that they haven't really done much for the franchise with this.<br /><br />throughout the movie, you are trying to find out who the identity of batwoman is, unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website (so if you haven't seen it already don't go there). i was sort of disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer. 75 minutes is way too short for any movie. the secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie, sort of midway, and becomes anti-climatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as batwoman will disappear after the movie is over.<br /><br />i'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie. i love the sleek new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for. some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away diverting your attention away from the storyline. i also didn't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes, it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is batman. similarly we should've gotten to know more about batwoman's personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with bruce wayne. also i think the fight with bane should have been done better. in typical children's fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by tripping, falling, getting electricuted or doing something dumb that works against them. come to think of it there wasn't even one drop of blood spilled in this movie either.<br /><br />bottom line, its a good entertaining flick and i recommend anyone who's a batman fan to watch it. it has good storyline, universal appeal and even great acting to top it off. i just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making batwoman stay to make things more interesting. not just introduce her and then kick her off once she's done. i'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally. to have some other than batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details.<br /><br />i hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the breakup between bruce wayne and barbra gordan. he's been stringing her along forever and doesn't even like her and i can't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older. i also want to see the time when tim drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man. in short i want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in batman beyond. otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story.<br /><br />
