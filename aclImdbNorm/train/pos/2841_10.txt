as a fan of paris je'taime, i went to see new york, i love you with very high expectations. i gladly walked out with all my expectations met. it was funny, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. the film starts out with two cab hoppers (bradley cooper & justin bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. that was funny, and then the film goes into some of the best skits i have ever seen anywhere. there were four amazing ones out of all the good ones. those four i will start talking about. one features shia labeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. the next one features orlando bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by christina ricci. another one features anton yelchin and olivia thirbly as two people going to prom, thirbly's character being handicapped. the best one features eli wallach and cloris leachman as a bickering old couple. i will bring to your attention that nataile portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and ethan hawke and maggie q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker. new york, i love you is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 paris je'taime. the skits are well-paced, and the film shows how indie films should really be. the film, however, does not have as many famous directors as paris je'taime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. if you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be entertained then definitely go see new york, i love you.
