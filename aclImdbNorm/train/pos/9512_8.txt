this is a film that can make you want to see it again. i especially, liked the way it ended. i did not see the end coming, but when laws was not blown away the first time, one suspects he will be back again.<br /><br />the story is gripping and could have been more psychological, but i understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that.<br /><br />hard to believe michael jr. could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away. but, i can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell.<br /><br />some have complained about hanks as a gangster. i believe that isn't justified. if his character had been any harder, he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not.<br /><br />eight stars for this one. although it was released in 2002, i just saw it for the first time yesterday on dvd.
