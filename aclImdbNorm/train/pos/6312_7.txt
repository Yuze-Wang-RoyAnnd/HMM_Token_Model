before george clooney directed sam rockwell in his directorial debut "confessions of a dangerous mind", they starred together in this movie. george clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer, along with steven soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. in potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project, that is in the same line with movie-remakes such as "ocean's eleven" and "the italian job" but somehow this movie is only halve successful, or at least it isn't as good as it could had been.<br /><br />the movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop. even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters, they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie. the fact that they are being played doesn't change much to this, even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying, or anything like that at all.<br /><br />it's of course due to the writing that the characters aren't used to their full potential. i can only assume that the original italian movie "i soliti ignoti" works out much better than this movie does. the movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling.<br /><br />nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity. it's an harmless little caper movie, in which you simply shouldn't to worry much about the story. in that regard "welcome to collinwood" is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well.<br /><br />it's a movie that you won't regret watching once you've finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing.<br /><br />7/10
