the visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films. it also seems a lot more erotically charged than i remember the other films being. if you're a big fan of flying prehensile hair and tongues that can reach all the way down into your stomach, you'll like this film.
