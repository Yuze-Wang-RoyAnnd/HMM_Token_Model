a glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001: a space odyssey. miles apart in vision, but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless. a magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn. you've probably seen this scene in the trailer, but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and, results, an avalanche. the horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible. <br /><br />the movie traces two characters, a mammoth named manfred (ray romano) and a buck-toothed sloth (john leguizamo) as they try to migrate south. they find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them. they are joined by a saber tiger named diego (denis leary) whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan, by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap. diego's meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all, but diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end. <br /><br />there are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip, including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in shrek. characters contemplate on why they're in the ice age, while they could have called it the big chill or the nippy era. some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming. another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends: `all the great guys are never around. the sensitive ones get eaten.' throwaway lines galore, whimsical comedy and light-fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch. also, food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as `good eating.' <br /><br />the vocal talents of romano, leguizamo and leary make good on their personas, while the children will delight in their antics, the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents. there is some mild violence and intense content, but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age-old battle of good versus evil, and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties. the animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic.<br /><br />
