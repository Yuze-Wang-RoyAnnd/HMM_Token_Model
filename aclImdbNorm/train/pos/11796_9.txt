just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2-part 1980 made-for-tv film attention. but the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the rev. jim jones, who built a church into a virtual empire, and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which a congressman and his entourage were assassinated, and 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking kool-aid doused with cyanide.<br /><br />done very tastefully but horrifying enough, unlike the excruciatingly sadistic cult of the damned, guyana tragedy features an all-star cast, including ned beatty (as rep. leo ryan), meg foster, randy quaid, brad dourif, brenda vaccaro, levar burton, and madge sinclair. but it is powers boothe (in his first big role) that really stands out as jim jones. he actually becomes the man, and his performance is riveting and chilling. thus, it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
