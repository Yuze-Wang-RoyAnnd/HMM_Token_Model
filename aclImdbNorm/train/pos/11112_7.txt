take a pinch of goodfellas, mix it with the godfather, add some roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy, and you have the sopranos, about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey. it's almost as entertaining as pro wrestling. i am not the biggest fan of this show, but i do admire james gandolfini's very complicated tony soprano, a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience. i also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel-voiced dom chianese as the bewildered but murderous uncle junior, silver-haired tony sirico as the perpetually perplexed paulie and the very beautiful edie falco as the duplicitous, tough-as-nails carmela soprano. the violence is sudden and graphic, the body count steadily climbs each season, but it is often the small moments that matter most here. watch paulie and tony's nephew christopher (michael imperioli late of law & order) as they get lost in the pine barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck, both convinced they've had it.
