kristine watts (molie weeks) is broken apart, missing her lover; she is not able to overcome her love for him that is lost in the past. she hires a stranger (douglas davis) and gives a list of her mistakes to him with things to fix. but time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end.<br /><br />the first point that impresses in "the cure" is the stylish cinematography that alternates black and white with color. the concise and sharp screenplay is capable to develop a tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minutes. the soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a little loud and associated to the fact that english is not my native language, in some moments i needed to repeat some words whispered by the narrator. the unknown lead actress has magnificent performance and is extremely gorgeous. i hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen. last but not the least, the debut of the director and writer ryan jafri could not be better. my vote is nine.<br /><br />title (brazil): not available
