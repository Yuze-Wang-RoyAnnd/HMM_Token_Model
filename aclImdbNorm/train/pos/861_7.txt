what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters? the major point is we believe in those characters and once they've met each other we want them to stay together. it's simple and really efficient. the background story is less important. why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller? it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french film-jerkers like to make. not too much ambition, right: sur mes l`evres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization.<br /><br />for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy. it goes quite as easy as in rear window (an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film) but with a less compelling context. where i am amazed it's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. he brings very little to the story; when he appears alone we wonder if we've not missed a part before. jacques audiard is not a new-comer yet. strange and weird.
