this movie is funny and suitable for any age. it is definitely family-type entertainment. the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid-western town of big bean, illinois. where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp from the interstate. the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians. but these martians are totally inept, despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons... including one set on eradicating the martians, too! the martians dead-pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them... leave earth. j. j. anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines. watch this movie for laugher and entertainment; thought-provoking it isn't. but subtle and enjoyable it is.
