saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. i'm a student of screen writing and i loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something pivotal/climatic happened in a scene. <br /><br />i thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking - at one particular point barbara stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter's boyfriend; and rekindling some passion in her husband whom she hasn't seen in ten years; and with the gunshot signal 'two shots and then one' she hooks up with her old shag mate dutch (the reason she left town in the first place!) all at the same time! the moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the 50's.<br /><br />love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue - just to watch barbara stanwyck and co doing the 'bunny hug' is good enough reason to rent this film on dvd.<br /><br />one of the best films from that period i've seen in a long time.
