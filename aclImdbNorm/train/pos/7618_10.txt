hi:<br /><br />i heard about lost from a co-worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment, he loved it. well i watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so i tuned it out. after a few years i stumbled upon lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. wow was i surprised. can you say gravity well, damn i got sucked in. the pace and scripting are very good, some of the flash forward/backs are so so with the lamer characters, but over all good. my favorite characters are ben, locke, jacob, richard alpert, sayid jarrah, sawyer, hurley, daniel faraday, jin & wife, walt, charlie, desmond, and jack's dad. jack and michael definitely are immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. kate 1 step above them, juliet was way more classy than kate. mr. eko way under-rated and on the level of charlie if not more, too bad they both died. the guy dressed in black talking to jacob (way back) is a genuine curiosity. as a whole great, very layered series: looking for more.<br /><br />regards
