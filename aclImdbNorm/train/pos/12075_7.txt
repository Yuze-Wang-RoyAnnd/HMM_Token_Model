nina foch insists that "my name is julia ross" in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready. it's short, and because it is, the film suffers. it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer.<br /><br />when i was growing up, foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles. here, she's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role. julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs. hughes and her son ralph. little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />it's a live-in situation; once julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's mrs. hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />the acting is very good. low budget but still entertaining - some things, particularly at the end, happen way too quickly, which is why i said the movie is too short. nevertheless, i recommend it.
