i liked this movies. its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen, all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice... another rule of yash raj's film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent. think back to all of those films.. mpk suman didn't have mom, hmapk salman didn't have parents, and final rule is that you are 90% likely to see alock nath crying...<br /><br />the film is good too. its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough. the little kid (hero's nephew) is well placed and deliver very good one liners. the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't get that in real life. this film doesn't have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films. there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film. there isn't a strong message from this film but its a good watch. if you are married (arranged marriage)the film will remind you of what you went through. and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you ...<br /><br />overall a very good looking film. no big plots or twists but a very gentle film, very much like bollywood classic.
