viggo mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden (played well by lane smith) has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence. lincoln kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life. when i think prison movies, i always think action movies starring stallone or van damme or high caliber dramas such as shawshank redemption or the green mile. however i didn't expect a ghost story more along the lines of exorcist iii. prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of renny harlin's career. the movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of (at the time) unknowns. lane smith comes off the best because his warden isn't the usual clich'e of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations.<br /><br />*** out of 4-(good)
