i absolutely love this movie and would really like to have it someday. it's just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a turquoise necklace, i loved it and would like to see it again! i don't remember too much about it, but that a native american boy lives in a nice village with his family, and i don't remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone. his sister packs him some food and he goes. while he's out there, some other indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. the legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, it is the boy. i was always fascinated with legends, particularly native american legends and i would love to see this released someday to a dvd, please release it, whoever's concerned!
