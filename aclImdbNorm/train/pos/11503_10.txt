kolchak is sheer entertainment. great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down. darren mcgavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him. simon oakland, jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having. some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes - erik estrada in legacy of terror, phil silvers in horror in the heights, antonio fargas in the zombie. it's easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files. darren - rip. simon - rip. ruth - rip.
