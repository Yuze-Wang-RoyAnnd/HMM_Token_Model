first off, i hadn't seen "the blob" since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience. pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today. and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s "fear of teenagers". but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be.<br /><br />sure, it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world. but "the blob" packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults don't believe them. in fact, there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy-colored world. and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him.<br /><br />to sum up, if you can take off your postmodern irony filter, there's a lot more to love here than meets the eye.
