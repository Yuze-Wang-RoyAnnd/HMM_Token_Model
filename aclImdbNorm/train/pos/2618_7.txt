possible spoilers: not sure<br /><br />while watching the lion king 1 1/2, i couldn't help but have mixed feelings about the whole film. it is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. but there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that the lion king did. the story, for those who haven't read the other reviews, is about how timon and pumbaa meet, and how they affect events in the original lion king.<br /><br />there are actually some very funny jokes in the movie. my favorite part is when they show the pair raising simba. however, for me the worst parts have to be when they show timon and pumbaa directly interfering with the events of the original. i can never look at the "circle of life" or "can you feel the love tonight" sequences the same way again (i'm okay with the "i just can't wait to be king" sequence).<br /><br />the voice talents are excellent. nathan lane and ernie sabella do a wonderful job, as do matthew broderick, the guy who does rafiki, and the hyenas. even the actor who does young simba sounded enough like jonathon taylor thomas for me. but why did they even include a voice actor for zazu? he literally had only 2 lines, and neither were very necessary. the additions of julie kavner and jerry stiller only add to the talent, although you still can't hear timon's mom's voice and not think of marge simpson.<br /><br />there are some scenes that seem to not fit in with the original, the one coming to mind being when they are pride rock at the end. how did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the hyenas?<br /><br />as for the dvd itself, you can't help but feel that for a 2 disc set, the special features are especially lacking. they could have easily fit a commentary, or another aspect ratio on the 1st disc. i enjoyed the "who wants to be king of the jungle" game, even if it is the most shameful example of cross promotion i've ever seen. some of the questions are actually difficult.<br /><br />overall, a good movie, though not nearly as good as tlk or even tlk2.
