yet again, madhur bhandarkar takes you on a ride to the wild side. and a remarkable one it is, literally and figuratively.<br /><br />mumbai hi-society -- stars and starlets, glam dolls and witch doctors, business tycoons and broker types, yep the whole stinking lot -- are in sharp focus here. in typical tabloid fashion, their worlds unfold, with every colorful story a clever sub-plot in itself.<br /><br />a struggling starlet dumped by the producer after getting her pregnant, the stewardess and her high-profile husband, the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, the reporters and the police captain; all shades on display and countless hues in between.<br /><br />bhandarkar does a swell job of digging up the dirt on the drama kings, the dancing queens and the living dead. atul kulkarni packs a punch, as does boman irani and sandhya mrudul. konkona sen sharma is effective as the ex-crime beat reporter, but she could have been dolled up a little in keeping with the job change and the party circuit.<br /><br />highly focused (running time 140 min) and refreshingly different film, well worth the money.
