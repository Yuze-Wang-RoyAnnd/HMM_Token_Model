i saw this movie by luck, just because i was going through a phase where i had a new found admiration for bill pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank god i did! this movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites! the story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom.<br /><br />alice and darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story. the struggle they go through as they are arrested in thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense. the acting is amazing, the images extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful. i actually can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time i watch it. i know some people haven't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but i swear, this one, you have to see!!! i promise it will stick with you!
