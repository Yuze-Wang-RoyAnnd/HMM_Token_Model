my room-mate ordered this one off of the web a while back and i finally got around to watching it. it is gross. it is cheezy. it is pretty dumb... but it is also a lot of fun. i mean, this was the most fun we have had watching a movie like this since "city of the walking dead" ages ago. it was like being at the old drive-in theater again! you could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies. this one has all the cliches and tricks from those films rolled into one, and it's neat because it is suppose to be like that. the cheeze factor is high, the gore flows and the laughs roll! the effects go from sloppy to good, with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart shoved through his chest both being excellent! the acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good. there is not much plot, just lots and lots of gore. this one is patterned after the zombie movies from italy and spain i think, because they linger on the gross scenes forever, like this movie. if you like troma movies, cheezy b-grade stuff, then you can do no wrong watching this one. a nice way to waste a friday night!
