i was waiting to see this movie from a long time. it's promos gave a fair idea about the content and when i finally saw it, i really find it was quite well made. most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life. this is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple fardeen and esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon. the acting is really spell binding though i think esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself. the story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate. the editing and direction were also good, meghna gulzar really did a good job here. to summarize i would say it is a good drama cum romance, a true combination of what bollywood can offer a clean entertainer.
