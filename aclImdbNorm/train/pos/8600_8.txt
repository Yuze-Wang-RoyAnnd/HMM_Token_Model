there was some hesitation from my part about what this movie had to offer. for starters, the casting didn't seem right. kiefer sutherland had already done very well in "24" and the preview didn't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience. eva longoria appeared out of place, and the rest didn't seem very interesting.<br /><br />when the film finally ended, i was not completely displeased for i had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better, had the responsible parties taken a little more care to watch for the narrative gaps and given a little more care to character development. we have seen threats of this type before, and that made the main conflict much more challenging to the writers. as an audience, we don't want to sit through the same old story again. we want to see something different, be thrilled and entertained.<br /><br />there is nothing wrong with the casting. from kim basinger's delicious first lady. she carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable. michael douglas has been and done that before. unfortunately, the president is much of a non entity to even care about his fate. sutherland rehashes his "24" tough guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and eva does a passable job, as the newcomer.<br /><br />don't expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ("north by northwest" and "the fugitive" come to mind). leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be. it's o.k.
