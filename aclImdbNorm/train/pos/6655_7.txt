it is one of the better indian movies i have seen lately, instead of crappy song and dance or slum dog movies. all the actors have showed the right emotions at the right intensity with right timing. it is the hallmark of a good movie, that it make the viewer go back and research the subject, which exactly what i did checking on harilal. i always enjoy akshay khanna's subtle style of acting and interestingly he had rather a complicated relationship with his own father vinod khanna, albeit not as dramatic as gandhis and wonder how it helped him essay this character. i was impressed by the direction and 2 thumbs up for anil kapoor for producing such a classy movie.
