okay, first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free! first - this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d. it is for the most part, but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d! what!!?!?! it's not that hard to film in a car!!! second - the story isn't very good. there are a lot of things wrong with it.<br /><br />third - why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film! it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed!!! watch it for a good laugh , but don't waste your time buying it. just download it or something for cheap.
