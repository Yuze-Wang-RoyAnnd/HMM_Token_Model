ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for "jean de florrette". hello! this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form. i would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point. this film is clearly made for people who don't appreciate the so called "american humour" which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap. the point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off.<br /><br />thankyou
