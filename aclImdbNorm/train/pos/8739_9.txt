this is a funny film. it has all the usual disney components (music, great range of characters, story, appeal), entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say "antz" and "price of egypt".<br /><br />the characters work really well, and have a strong appeal, and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers. the movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the cinema experience.<br /><br />call me crazy, but i have seen the film three times, and i intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend. many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed. i work in a multiplex, and i can honestly say that no-one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />see it, and don't be put off because it is animated. you are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits! the bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the film, which is packed with laughs throughout.
