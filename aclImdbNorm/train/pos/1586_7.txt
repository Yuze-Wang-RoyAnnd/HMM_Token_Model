rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions, which could have kept away many film goers looking for a pianist similar plot. fortunately, von trotta, a good screenwriter, opts for a feminist peep to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary aryan german rather from a jewish standpoint. rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they emerge as victims. the pace of the film is introspective, poignantly slow, meditative. besides, the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passing of time has been deftly crafted. rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative flaws are well discerned. another fault lies on a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama lived by the characters. nevertheless, this film is worth seeing. finally, rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in german films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past,trend that includes such excellent films as nowhere in africa, and recently, the controversial downfall. i would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images.
