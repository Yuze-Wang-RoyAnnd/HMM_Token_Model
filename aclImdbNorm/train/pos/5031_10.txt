this movie is beautifully designed! there are no flaws. not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. the script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple mission.<br /><br />paxton is at his best in this role. his mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue. each shot meticulously done! surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour. this may not be the best picture of the year, but it's a gem that has been very well polished. it's not for the simple mind.
