the usual cat and mouse antics abound until jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink. he gets the bright idea of torturing tom without him knowing. the cat gets wise and tries to do stuff to make him 'see' jerry even if it's not fool-proof. of course jerry gets butch aka killer aka spike the dog into the act (even if it's late in the short, and his contribution is minimal indeed) brilliant animated short which kind of reminded me of the one with the white mouse who scares tom so badly. most of the gags work and all violent as any good tom and jerry short should truly be. this hilarious cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of "tom & jerry" <br /><br />my grade: b+
