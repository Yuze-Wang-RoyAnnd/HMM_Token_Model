a very high-standard columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long-running series but was originally transmitted second (after "murder by the book").<br /><br />robert culp makes his first of three appearances as the guest murderer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency, who blackmails the wife (patricia crowley) of a rich, highly influential businessman (played very sympathetically by ray milland) after he falsifies a report, in her favour, after it is discovered she was having an affair. the wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage....<br /><br />a very satisfying episode in many respects, particularly as the plot is so strongly set-up and subsequently developed and also because of the rare columbo ingredient that the crime is an unpremeditated killing. the whole thing is further enhanced when the widowed husband uses the murderer to assist columbo in his investigations: a feature that facilitates numerous good quality scenes, particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and columbo's crucially deceptive qualities are wonderfully in evidence.<br /><br />directed with flair by bernard l. kowalski and acted to an appropriately high level, this really set the tone for whole series (since "murder by the book" was let down by a poor ending). the script by columbo creators richard levinson and william link is precise, well-structured and well-thought-out and is underpinned by a steady, productive pace and meaningful sequences which really exhibit the unpredictability of the story. ultimately, the finale fittingly epitomises that columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer.<br /><br />overall, this is a very fine piece of detective work for columbo, and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and constructively to render a polished columbo story.
