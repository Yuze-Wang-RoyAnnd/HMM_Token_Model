this is a real eye candy. a world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities. huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is hurling cathedrals at their opponents... who can resist that? an ancient prophecy, a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero... sounds familiar...? yes we heard that song before. but you will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery.<br /><br />this movie is fun to watch while it lasts. but after leaving the cinema you'll be longing for a little bit more story.<br /><br />what is behind the 30-years-circle? what drove the knight crazy? who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities... and why are they falling apart? and apart from that one bunch of farmers, where are the people? really, this picture looks so intriguing, but it's no lord of the rings.
