i kind of liked the lonely lady. give pia a break. she looks great and she has really nice eyes. what's not to like? the scene where she gets raped by ray liotta with a garden hose was kind of gross and cruel. actually, a lot of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel. but its a trashy movie. a lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad. i liked this better than valley of the dolls, which was not only trashy but boring as well. at least this wasn't boring.<br /><br />pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer. watching her talk about pushkin and byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable. i'm sure pia's a nice person in real life, she just doesn't project the writer vibe. she looked much happier when she was working as a hostess for that guy from saturday night fever and wearing a glittery disco dress.<br /><br />a couple of the scenes are funny. the one where she tells the two-timing actor that she's pregnant and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to "stop hanging around!", all the while he's practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces by.<br /><br />pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. it was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it (the vortex of floating faces and freeze-frame scream - whoa!) and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdone.<br /><br />the acceptance speech is a hoot, though. i want to see someone do that speech in a drama class.<br /><br />but, again, this is trash we're talking about. you could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties.
