i was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the maryland film festival. i've always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the gimmicks of william castle, so this was definitely a must-see for me.<br /><br />this is about the life and work of william castle, who in my opinion was an underrated director. true, he made some cheap budget schlocky horror films, but he added something to these films: real live theater gimmicks that you don't see anymore. for example, he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack at his movies and put vibrators at the bottoms of chairs in the tingler.<br /><br />this is truly a well-made documentary and brings this rather shadowed director into the light, and celebrated his contributions to horror cinema. it also paints castle as a larger than life character, who was very well-liked and had a smile on his face.<br /><br />unlike most film documentaries that mostly show testaments from film historians, spine tingler! shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work, such as john waters, john landis, and joe dante. a must see for classic horror and sci-fi fans.
