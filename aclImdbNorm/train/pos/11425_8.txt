the story is about a little girl growing up in colonial africa, but it is so much more than that.<br /><br />anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things. a longing for another, one of a different race, that cannot be consummated. even a glance is forbidden. there are no words needed. their facial expressions say everything.<br /><br />it is the story of a black servant, prot'ee (isaach de bankol'e) and a white woman, aim'ee (giulia boschi). their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other.<br /><br />the little girl, france (c'ecile ducasse) is lonely and spends all her time with prot'ee. she really can't see this dance.<br /><br />one of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials. they cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves. there world is about to end; they just don't know it yet. their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence.<br /><br />i think i would like to visit this africa. it seems so quiet; especially at night when you only hear the animals.
