****spoilers**** the film "sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos "gunny" hathcock. the unassuming soft-spoken mister rogers look-alike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed vietcong and north vietnamese military kills during his two tours in "nam".which shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is.<br /><br />tom berenger is cool clam and deadly as sgt.thomas beckett who's at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless. since there's nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hit-man. backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country.<br /><br />the story of the film "sniper" is focused on sgt.beckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and us government agent richard miller, billy zane, being sent deep inside the panamanian jungle. the two snipers are to take out rebel general miguel alveraze, frederick miraglittoa, and colombian drug king-pin raul ochoa, carlos alveraze, who's supporting him in a planned a military take-over of the country. <br /><br />we see earlier in the movie sgt. beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in "sniper". for it shows step by step how sgt. beckett with the help of his spotter cpt. papich, aden young, does his job. there's also a sub-plot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper desilva, eward wiley, who was stalking beckett and who later killed papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter. you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but sgt. beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching desilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as bait.<br /><br />what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambo-like ending with sgt. beckett and agent miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fog.<br /><br />"sniper" is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies: a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy.
