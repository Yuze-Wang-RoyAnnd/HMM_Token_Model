any film in the early days of orson welles is a triumph all the way to the third man with joseph cotton. he is also wonderful in a touch of evil. please see them all! he tends to get pompous and self serving in films like f is for fake, really stupid waste of film.don't waste your time watching it. it is really ignorant. orson welles is a film icon and anyone studying film should see everything he has filmed. all his leading ladies are tremendous but in the end welles became a fat drunk, like his character in a touch of evil! for some reason orson welles had a way with women, i see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not like gary cooper or joseph cotton, or cary grant,john wayne, i could go on and on but i digress... and because i am a woman,i can see the attraction to him. he (orson welles) is one of the last true film makers and unless you count the film-makers of today: tarantino, scorscese, spike lee, most of the film makers just don't measure up to the film makers of the forties! i know there are many more great film makers of today but in such a short amount of time i can't name them all. no offense to any of the great film makers of this millennium! august 21,2006. please remind me of some current up and coming film makers, i don't want to be stuck in the past! i love some of the films out now, but rarely are there any that i would put on a "100 best" list.. "hustle and flow" was great, so was "fargo", and "oh, brother, where art thou," from a line in sullivan's travels; another fine film from the forties! can anyone give me a best list for the 90's and on up to 2006? i would like to know who to watch! thank you! also props to this website! where else can you plug a film or boo it! i love the ranting and raving from regular folks like me who can say what i want and i promise not to spoil any film for someone who hasn't seen it yet!
