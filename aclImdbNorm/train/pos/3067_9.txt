what a surprising treat to come across on late television. had i only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie, i would have passed. the idea of a movie about a hit-man-seeing-a shrink-wanting-to leave-the-business-and-falling-in-love....sounds trite. but the film works. from the start of the movie, it's clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders, before he even says a word. the look and feel of the film is perfect. dark, but not obnoxiously so.<br /><br />aside from the hit-man family aspect which provides a touch of surrealism, macy's character grapples with his marriage, and his father's control. macy shows a repressed sadness, and his bedtime talks with his young son are amazing. the young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years, and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural, personal and loving.<br /><br />this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while, and i can't believe i came across it by accident on late night television.
