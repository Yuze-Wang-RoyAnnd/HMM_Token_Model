in lizzie borden's "love crimes" (1992), sean young plays a gritty d.a. in atlanta. she's a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man (patrick bergin) who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes compromising photos of them, then leaves them.<br /><br />naturally, this tough loner decides to enter the phony shutterbug's life by posing as his prey, intending to bring him to justice. they meet, they make love, then the next thing she knows, she is over his lap, getting spanked. (note: the spanking scene is only in the "unrated" version of this film. the r-rated version omits it and several other scenes that would make the plot more lucid.) this psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images, such as bergin chasing one of his victims around the room, flailing at her with a riding crop.<br /><br />as a thriller, "love crimes" is at its best when sean young is playing her cat-and-mouse game with bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. it's unfortunate that the film doesn't end, it just stops. that's true. director lizzie borden may have just run out of story to tell, but after 92 minutes the credits roll, and we are left with a puzzling "what just happened?" bewilderment.<br /><br />the unfolding of young's plan is played out in engaging style, but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn-off for some viewers.<br /><br />dan (daneldorado@yahoo.com)
