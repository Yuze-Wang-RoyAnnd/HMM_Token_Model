entertaining musical where nathan detroit needs $1,000.00 to get up a floating crap game so he entices sky masterson to try and get salvation army girl, played by jean simmons, to go with masterson to havana.<br /><br />5 years later, simmons would be in the missionary again in the fabulous "elmer gantry." there she was sister sharon and here she is sister sarah. same temperament, different story.<br /><br />frank sinatra is that devilish nathan detroit. he has been engaged to vivian blaine for 14 years and she loathes his gambling habit.<br /><br />in a real change of pace, sky masterson was played by marlon brando who actually did his own singing here!<br /><br />the film is saved by superlative choreography. those dance and singing routines are fabulous. they are especially realized by stubby kaye as nicely nicely (johnson).<br /><br />all in all, it's a very nice production.
