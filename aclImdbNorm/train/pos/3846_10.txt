basically, i like verhoeven film because in his film, i enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that i have seen before in "basic instinct".it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much.so it is obviously for me to watch this another verhoeven movie.<br /><br />well, it is his previous direction before his block buster hit "basic instinct" and for that i was very much curious to watch that movie and yeah, the movie has fulfilled my hope and expectation.<br /><br />this movie "the fourth man" is a brilliant pscychosexual drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences. the story of this movie is about a gay writer named "reve"(krabbe), an alcoholic person who is lives by his own moral values and sees many visions that may warn him from a future accident.after the end of his lecture, he introduce a seductive woman named "christine", who has a mysterious past she doesn't want to reveal.reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy.next morning, he watch her sexy, macho boyfriend's picture on her table, the person he met at the station.he is curious to meet him and tell christine to invite him to her house.<br /><br />that's it. i don't want to reveal the entire story because it is a verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising!<br /><br />especially, i like the character "reve" which is brilliantly played by "krabbe".i basically like his acting because as a gay person i am purely identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face.<br /><br />i would like thanks mr.verhoeven to make such a black comedy.<br /><br />i rate this movie: 10 out of 10.
