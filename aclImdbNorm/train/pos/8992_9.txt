a really cool flick. a must for any music snob. you don't really have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie. before the movie, i only heard only two songs from the dandy warhols. the only thing is required is an open mind. <br /><br />the movie centers around the brian jonestown massacre. the dandy warhols have a role in the film, as the 'rival band,' but they are second fiddle to the bjm. the dandy warhols don't play as big of a role in the film as i originally guessed, but then again, they didn't have the element of excitement and unpredictability of the bjm.you can't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic front man, anton newcombe. by itself, it's an insightful film and study on the music industry. just watch this film and enjoy.
