the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved. i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. i love all six of the stooges (curly, shemp, moe, larry, joe, and curly joe)! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team! <br /><br />this is a good three stooges short. it funny and its cast includes christine mcintyre,symona boniface, gino corrado, fred kelsey, sam flint, chester conklin, theodore lorch, lynton brent, judy malcolm, vernon dent, john tyrrell, heinie conklin, and bess flowers. the stooges performed very well in this short! i recommend this one!
