the scottish artist andy goldsworthy fashions natural materials into ephemeral artworks, assembling rocks into egg-shaped cairns, filling riverside rock-pools with fiery flowers and stitching thorns and twigs into intricate web patterns. an original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of southampton art gallery (near where i live), but although i found these pieces intriguing, i only realised the wonder of goldsworthy's work when i was lucky enough to catch a re-screening of rivers and tides.<br /><br />thomas reidelsheimer's film, accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by fred frith, brings goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work. the opening scene captures him fusing icicle fragments into a snake-like thread set atop a tree-stump. working with his teeth and bare hands, goldsworthy crafts a beautiful, ephemeral work. before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant nova scotian sunlight. this scene is among the most beautiful in the film, but the breadth and inventiveness of goldsworthy's work is remarkable. reidelsheimer shows both the successes and the failures, capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine, even if for just a few hours, minutes or seconds.<br /><br />goldsworthy himself provides the narration, speaking slowly but thoughtfully about the themes in his work. he makes plain his need to work with nature, to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural materials, even when they seem to be working against him. at times he is down-to-earth and humorous; at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose
