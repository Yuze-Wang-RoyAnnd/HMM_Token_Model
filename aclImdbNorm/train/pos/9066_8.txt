~~i was able to see this movie yesterday morning on a early viewing pass~~<br /><br />i am a mom of 2 children, who range from 11 down to 6. so i'm sure plenty of parents can relate to having to see many many "kids" movies. this was refreshing for me. i haven't read this particular book, so i don't know if it stayed true to the book or not. but it sure took the grossness factor to a high level. this is the story of the "new" kid in town and it just so happens that there are a group of boys who have formed a club of sorts and love to pick on kids ....sound familiar? haven't we all suffered this one time or another. he has the little brother who he cant stand and parents that he is embarrassed about. what i enjoyed most of all was seeing how each character was totally different from another they all stood out. the bully (why do they always make the bully a red head? my daughter has red hair! and she is no bully!..lol) is well a great bully, who finds himself being yelled at by his own big brother. it took twists and turns and well you fall in love with all of them and really find yourself routing for all the characters! even the parents, great connection between father and son. all around enjoyable, sweet,funny, gross etc......take your kids!!! you will enjoy it as much as they do!
