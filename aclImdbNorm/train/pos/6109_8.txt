my tutor friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to my sassy girl.. there's no kissing/sex scenes. hollywood should learn more from korean productions. sex is not always required in a good romantic movie.<br /><br />the movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon cg scenes blended into the movie. i like the part when ji-hoon almost kissed su-wan. the funniest moment is when ji-hoon punched su-wan's first love because he dumped su-wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon. how he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings smiles to the audience.<br /><br />mao points: 8/10
