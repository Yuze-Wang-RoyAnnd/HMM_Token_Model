i was pleasantly surprised by the film. let's face it; the premise doesn't sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a the night's flick, but it had an easygoing nature that wins one over. there were no moments that i found uproarious, and i doubt any that i'll remember the next day, but this doesn't fail as a nice diversion. what i found funny was watching it here in peking with my chinese girlfriend who never understands anything i like. i told her there was a plot- three guys have to bring back some weed to london. hardly satisfying for her. there is no mugging going on here for the camera which i'd been expecting after reading a number of the comments. i do take exception however to comparisons with withnail and i; not in the same league, and i doubt was it intended to. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
