this is the best piece of film ever created its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye. ill never forget my experience watching it. i don't understand why people don't think as i do the dinosaur turns in a performance reminiscent of de niro in raging bull, pacino in scarface, and crowe in gladiator combined. this should be released on dvd in superbit format so i can fully enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it. whoppi goldberg truly turns in the performance of a lifetime as a tough, gritty cop who is against her will teamed with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner then the hi-jinx ensues to say the least. by the way i'm saying the complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage.
