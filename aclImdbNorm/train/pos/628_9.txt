this movie is a lot of fun. the actors really make the movie go the distance though. without giving away the plot, i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time. you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie! (worth the price of admission just for that!) all the elements are there from adventure to romance, and well placed comedy.<br /><br />people of all ages will enjoy it. (my parents even did!) good special effects, may be scary for the little ones. good date movie. great for some escapism.<br /><br />deserves an a. (hope it does well at the box office)
