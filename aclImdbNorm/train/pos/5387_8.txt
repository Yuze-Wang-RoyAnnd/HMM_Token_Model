even in the 21st century, child-bearing is dangerous: women have miscarriages, and give birth prematurely. seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. that is the theme of "life begins": a look at the "difficult cases" ward of a maternity hospital. loretta young plays the lead, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed is not germane to the plot) to give birth; she's conflicted about the fact she's going to have to give her baby up after birth. she's in a ward with several other women, who share their joys and pain with each other.<br /><br />although loretta young is the lead, the outstanding performance, as usual, is put in by glenda farrell. farrell was one of warner's "b" women in the 1930s, showing up quite a bit in supporting roles, and sometimes getting the lead in b movies (farrell played torchy blane in several installments of the "torchy" b-movie series.) here, farrell plays an expectant mother who doesn't want her children, since they'll only get in the way. she does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses, including smuggling liquor into the ward (this of course during the prohibition days), and drinking like a fish -- apparently they'd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s.<br /><br />interestingly, unlike most movie of the early 1930s, it's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men -- that situation is reversed, with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly. (watch for veteran character actor frank mchugh as one of the expectant fathers.) "life begins", being an early talkie, treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama, to be sure, but it's quite a charming little movie. turner classic show it, albeit infrequently; i've only seen it show up on a few days honoring loretta young. but it's highly recommended viewing when it does show up.
