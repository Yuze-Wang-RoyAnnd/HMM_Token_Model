this is probably one of brian de palma's best known movies but it isn't his best. body double, the fury and carrie are better movies but this movie is better than blow out and obsession. de palma is very influenced by hitchcock and this movie is a take off on psycho. angie dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair and after her psychiatrist, played by michael caine, turns down an offer, dickinson meets a man in a art gallery and she winds up sleeping with him. after this point it's best you don't know what happens but there is a murder and nancy allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer. dennis franz is the detective on the case who really doesn't trust allen and she has to find the killer herself. it's a pretty good movie but isn't one of de palma's best.
