a long film about a very important character from south africa, stephen biko. he is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died a long time before their normal time. the already old film though does not show how important biko was, what he really represented. his life and his teaching is reduced to little, at best a few witty remarks. the film being from 1987, the objective was to push south africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation. so the film aims at showing how irrational the south african supporters of apartheid are, in 1987. to show this the film has to look beyond biko's death, hence to center its discourse not on biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living. his escape is made necessary because of the victimization he is the victim of, along with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book on biko, after his death, and that can only happen in england. the film shows a way to escape south africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. so do not expect this way to be realistic and true. it could not be. but the film has tremendously aged because it does not show south africa with any historical distantiation, the very distantiation that has taken place under nelson mandela's presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out. the film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the indians. panegyric books or films all have that defect: they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view. that explains why the film has aged so much, seems to be coming from so long ago, as if nothing had changed at all. a remake is necessary.<br /><br />dr jacques coulardeau, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne, university versailles saint quentin en yvelines, cegid
