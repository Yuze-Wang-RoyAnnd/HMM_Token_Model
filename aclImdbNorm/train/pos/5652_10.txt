i love the series! many of the stereotypes portraying southerrners as hicks are very apparent, but such people do exist all too frequently. the portrayal of southern government rings all too true as well, but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the south as well. some things never change, and we see the "good old boys" every day! there is a lucas buck in every southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen, and the storybook "po' white trash" are all too familiar. aside from the supernatural elements, everything else could very well happen in the modern south! i somehow think trinity, sc must have been in barnwell county!
