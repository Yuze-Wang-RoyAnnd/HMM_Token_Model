i really dislike both shrek films. (since their both "pg" and have words in them i would never say myself, so i disliked them.)<br /><br />but when it comes to "spirit: stallion of the cimarron," which i just barely watched for the first time last month, i became a fan of animated films, other than pixar. ***spoilers ahead*** in "spirit: stallion of the cimarron," a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard. one night, he sees a strange light in the distance, and he sets off toward it. this action eventually leads to his capture, and several more things. throughout the movie, we hear a narration. it's through the thoughts of spirit, though the horses never talk. this is what makes the movie so goo. they (the movie makers) recored real horses to do the sounds the horses made; none of those sounds were made by humans.<br /><br />spirit meets rain, a beautiful mare, and little creek, a native-american, who owns rain. little creek later frees spirit and rain, they go running home.<br /><br />i have never been a big fan of brian adams, but i intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future. <br /><br />watch this film, and you won't regret it. my score: 10/10
