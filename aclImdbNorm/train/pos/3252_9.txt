the story of "a woman from nowhere" is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a eastwood spaghetti western: a mysterious stranger comes into a lawless town run by a kingpin and starts shooting up the place. even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel: sergio leone and ennio morricone would be proud. the really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (!) woman, saki (ryoko yonekura) on a harley, and the location is in a town somewhere in japan.<br /><br />in this actioner, there's a considerable amount of gunplay, some of it good, some predictable, and other spots somewhat hokey, but it's a whole lot of fun. ryoko handles her guns with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due. it wasn't much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge, but she handled things very well. she shows her acting skills much more as otsu in the nhk drama, "musashi."<br /><br />i'd highly recommend film if you're a ryoko yonekura fan (which i adoringly am) and/or a "girls with guns" movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings. to me, there's something eminently and inexplicably appealing about "girls with guns" movies like "la femme nikita" and "the long kiss goodnight." and to have a gorgeous gal like ryoko starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake.
