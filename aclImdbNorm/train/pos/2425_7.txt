i caught this movie on ifc and i enjoyed it, although i felt like the editing job was a little rough, though it may have been deliberate. i had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a pulp fiction-style non-linear plot presentation. it seemed a little forced, though. i certainly think that the movie is worth watching, but i think it could have used a little cleaning up. some scenes just don't seem to make sense after others. <br /><br />i'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is. it's not outstanding, but it doesn't have any really serious problems. i gave it a 7/10. the movie did show at least that laurence fishburne can act when he wants to. they must have just told him not to in the matrix movies.
