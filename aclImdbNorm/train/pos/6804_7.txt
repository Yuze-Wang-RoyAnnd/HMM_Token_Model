don't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic. this movie was shot in a lower budget ,probably against the will of ernest marishka, so he had to make due.for example england is portrayed as bordering on germany.by a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alone.they arrived their too quick. this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented, for the movie, was austrian. when she's told that she's queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her, where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen? why isbn't she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects ?low budget!where the audience back then aware of these imperfection? i wonder how the critics felt?durring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbn't excited about it. durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like " my old kentucky home" , and "old black joe". what? civil war songs in the 1830's? is romy schneider being portrayed as scarlet?where's mammy? is magna shnieder playing her too? is adrian hoven rhett or ashley? what was in marishka mind?well this add to the camp.it's unintentionally satirizing queen victoria'a story. this is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction germany and england are connected
