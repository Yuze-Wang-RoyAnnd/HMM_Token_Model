there is one detail, which is not very common for jackie chan movies, but which is present here. it has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too. jackie is menacing and psychotic here. he is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back (in a usual laid-back pattern), but he is the one who can go and start the tumult. his manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing. every time it goes "crack!". i also especially enjoy the scene when jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend. it's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen. besides, the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall (it also looks like a poster of "rabochiy" from our soviet era) and some lines in russian on the left (i noticed that quite accidentally). that looks terrific (and nostalgic for russian people). i also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies. here there's a lot of this stuff. it's quite amazing watching the characters falling/jumping/running/driving through all manner of panes.<br /><br />all three movies are great. i had been preparing myself to see the down-slide of the quality but i saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts (and not only jackie chan's character appears in all three movies - that's also excellent and keeps continuity up).<br /><br />i would like to describe each movie just in a few words: no.1 - great (in all aspects - it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous); no.2 - raging (jackie is really *beep* off here) and painful (jackie gets tortured); no.3 - unbelievable (the woman that fights alongside with jackie is incredible) and bombastic (should i mention a lot of guns and explosions?).<br /><br />as to the rest - much has been mentioned by the others.<br /><br />it's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again (at least by me). its place is in top 10 among action/comedy jewels. finally it's been released in russia on dvd (the 2nd film has the best options - the chinese/russian soundtracks and english/russian subtitles).<br /><br />solid 10 out of 10. thank you for attention.
