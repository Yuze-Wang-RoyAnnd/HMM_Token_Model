this movie is really special. it's a very beautiful movie. which starts with three orphans, sho, his brother shinji and their friend toshi, they're poor children's, living on the street, but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money, and then their able to live on, to buy a house, and their life seems to become much better. they're making new friend, life-friends. but something went wrong and they're becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each other.<br /><br />i was negative about this movie in the beginning, because when singers (gackt - solo, ex-singer in malice mizer, hyde - solo, singer in l'arc~en~ciel, both very famous in japan and wang lee-hom - taiwanese singer) trying to become actors, but this isn't like the other singers-going-actors-movies. they're doing a great job, and with no earlier experience in movies (except for lee-hom, who had been in two movies before).<br /><br />this is absolutely one of my favorite movies. maybe that's a little because i'm a very big fan of hyde, but - it was this movie who made me discover him.<br /><br />well, gackt (playing the main character - the orphan sho) was a part of the group who wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that hyde should play sho's friend, the vampire kei. at that time they didn't know each other, at least not like friends. but after the movie they became really good friend, and that shows us too that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperation.<br /><br />the movie have many different feelings running trough the story, love, hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. i think the first hour are the best, it's so beautiful. after that people are dying, kei's leaving and it all changes so much. but still it's a great movie, it's the only movie who has ever made me cry, it ends up so sad, but still beautiful.<br /><br />so if you haven't seen this movie, you really should. because it's wonderful, but sad. you won't regret it. ^^
