unlike other commentaries, i found this film fascinating, even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors.<br /><br />being a technologist, i found that the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic. although the reading of people minds via computer sounds fantastic, experiments are being conducted now to do just this. i will note that this experiments are in a very early stage, with results so far not favorable.<br /><br />the characters in the movie are well cast. the girl, although overacting a bit, looks suitable dumb. the truck driver is a a ringer for real truck drivers. the minister conveys doubt at first, (the principal investigator tells the minister that him (the minister), is not sure whether he believes that god created man or that man created god. but the minute when the chips are down, he falls back on his faith. only the phd plays the zombie. the secrets that they harbor are suitably appropriate for their characters. in the face of death they react as real human beings would.<br /><br />the movie is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by government. as strictly a thriller, the movie does not have enough thrills. as a scientific exercise with philosophical underpinnings it is fascinating.
