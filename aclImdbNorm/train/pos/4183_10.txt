i had seen this movie long time back, but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me.<br /><br />a wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of australian commandos who tried to sink some japanese ships at the singapore harbor during the height of ww2.<br /><br />these commandos are caught in plain-clothes and they are considered to be spies by the japanese captors. but something happens that hasn't been explored much in any hollywood ww2 movie that i have seen.<br /><br />a close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives. they begin to respect each other, while the captain of the captured australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior japanese prison guard. this is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really tugs your heart.<br /><br />soon, one day as the two friends are conversing, the aussie captain learns that some other captives are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the jap ships in the singapore harbor.<br /><br />he mentions that it was his team and not some other's that had sunk the ships to his japanese friend, and upon hearing this the japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed. but the captain remains adamant on confessing this to the japanese authorities.<br /><br />finally, the japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way that is according to their rules. this is the highest honor accorded to the captured warriors in japan.<br /><br />this is the most awesome part of the film where the aussie soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his aussie friend confess being guilty.<br /><br />i won't give away the ending here. but it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears.<br /><br />all in all, an excellent underrated movie that possibly didn't get the recognition that it deserved internationally. get one copy today and be mesmerized.
