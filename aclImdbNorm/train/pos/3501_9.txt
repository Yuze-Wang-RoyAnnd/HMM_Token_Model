one of the best films i have seen in the past five years! the cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the lower east side of new york city with the two leads being superstars in the making. funny, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts larry clark's often-nauseating shtick in the gutter where it belongs... although i have to admit that bully was a cut above his normal fare. raising victor vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing... so don't miss it!
