as i watched this movie, and i began to see its' characters develop i could feel this would be an excellent picture. when you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare. i had that very feeling throughout this movie. robert deniro and cuba gooding junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both oscar worthy. the supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the picture to grow on. i can say without any hesitation at all, see this movie it will not disappoint.
