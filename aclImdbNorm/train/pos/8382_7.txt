if you like mech war games it's pretty good. some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing. i've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and $350 to spare steel battalion. the movie is worth seeing at least once. there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there. less remakes and more original works. <br /><br />enjoy
