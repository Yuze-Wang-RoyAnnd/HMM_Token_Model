the quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time. pam dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue-chip prospects and make this work of art a must-see. academy award winners brenda fricker (home alone: lost in new york, a time to kill), ben johnson (the last picture show, red dawn), and adrien brody (the pianist, the village) amplify the atmosphere of the movie, drawing in an anxious audience. however, the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster jay o. sanders (jfk, the day after tomorrow).<br /><br />the story is centralized around a foster child, up-and-coming actor joseph gordon-levitt (brick, the lookout). sidekick milton davis jr. delivers a tear-jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents. the two don't have much, but what they do have: angels' baseball, and what they are seeking: identity. that's when 4-time emmy nominee danny glover (lethal weapon, predator 2) comes in to save the day as frustrated angels manager, george knox. in relation, all characters in the story seem to have the same mission: search within themselves to find out who they really are.<br /><br />depressed over the fact that roger (jgl) is separated from his father, he wishes to god for reunification if the angels can take the pennant. odds are astronomical, but 3-time emmy winner christopher lloyd (back to the future, my favorite martian) comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic (pun). before you know it, al (lloyd) is sitting with roger in the stands, snacking on cracker jacks, and causing some of baseball's biggest boners! dorothy kingsley and george wells' (dk oscar nominee gw oscar winner) 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind william dear (nominated in directors guild of america). he includes a touching side story centered around pitcher mel clark, played by tony danza (4-time golden globe nominee, emmy nominee), who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused anaheim. clark has been dubbed a wash-up, a once big-name in cinci, but he has something to prove to manager knox.<br /><br />spoiling this nail-biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century. this one is a diamond in the rough, and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace. did i mention a cameo by matthew mcconaughey (a time to kill, we are marshall) for all you ladies out there?
