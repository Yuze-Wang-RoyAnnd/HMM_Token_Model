i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it. it's beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time. it's difficult to believe this was made in 1946, as the tale is still fresh today, and really makes one think. i'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made. in addition, the acting is superb, and the use of english and american actors quite astounding. i recently purchased the dvd so now i'm able to watch whenever i wish. i highly recommend anyone interested in post-war british films to watch this.
