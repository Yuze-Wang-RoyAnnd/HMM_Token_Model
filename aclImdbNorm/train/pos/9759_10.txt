i believe i received this film when i was a young buck. i remembered watching it as a child, but i could never find the film. i remembered good ol rageddy ann, andy, babette, the greedy, king koo koo. i searched high and low for this movie and still no luck. but one day when i was moving out of my childhood home i had found it. we were reunited. i am 17 years old now. i still watch it. all the time actually. it's one of the funniest and touching movies i have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. and personally i think they should make a sequel. mmm, yes a sequel indeed. now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body!
