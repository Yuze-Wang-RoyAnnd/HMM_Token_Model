i really liked this movie because i have a husband just like the guy in this movie. this movie is about lindsey who meets ben in the middle of winter when baseball season isn't in. she falls in love but when spring comes along, she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal that ben has put her on.<br /><br />it's a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that ben has. he can't part from what he loves the most, that's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to lindsey in real life. also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he is.<br /><br />it's a funny movie and you won't strike out if you rent this one.
