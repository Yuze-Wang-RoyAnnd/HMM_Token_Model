well let me go say this because i love history and i know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and julia stiles became my #1 favorite actress after seeing her in "the '60s" and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history!!!!
