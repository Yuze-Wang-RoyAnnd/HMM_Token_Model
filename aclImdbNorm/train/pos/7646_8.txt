this movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices i have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different. it plays right into the " multiple universe " theory.<br /><br />the only thing that doesn't ring true is how larry burrows ( james belushi)has such a hard time understanding what is going on, that everything has changed.<br /><br />
