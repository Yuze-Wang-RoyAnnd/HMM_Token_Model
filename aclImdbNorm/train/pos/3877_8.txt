being from canada, i cannot say whether this film is original in the context of danish cinema - unfortunately, we, here, do not get to see many danish films in a year! i also cannot comment on clausen's acting in the context of his other roles - i personally found him quite believable - a touching monstrosity of a man, this jorgen! as for the actor who played kenneth - why would his participation in a tv show rule him out as an actor - aren't we over such elitist attitudes? international viewers unaware of his big brother participation will find him a fair actor.<br /><br />in spite of the movie's faults (the writing could have been subtler in some instances), i do subscribe to what one could call the 'message' of the film - namely art's essential role in everyday life, art as healing force. art, as nietzsche said, sanctifies the lie ('kunst heiligt die luege') - it is a holy lie: the wedding scene is fabulous in this sense - a theatrical, not religious, wedding, celebrating love and life as play...
