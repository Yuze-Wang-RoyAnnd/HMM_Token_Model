prof. janos rukh (boris karloff) discovers radium x--a powerful force to be used for atomic power. unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the dark--and his touch causes instant death. dr. felix benet (bela lugosi) develops an antidote--but rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him.<br /><br />the plot is silly and the "effects" that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable, but this is still a fun little chiller. it moves quickly, has some great atmosphere (notice rukh's "house" and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and karloff and lugosi (as always) give great performances. there is also good acting by franic drake (as rukh's wife) and violet kemble cooper (as his mother). so it's ok but just a notch below all the other karloff/lugosi movies. the plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow. still i did like this. i give it a 7.
