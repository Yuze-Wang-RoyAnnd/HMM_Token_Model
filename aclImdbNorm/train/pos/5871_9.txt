i cherish each and every frame of this beautiful movie. it is about regular people, people we all know, who suffer a little in their life and have some baggage to carry around. just like all of us. robert deniro, ed harris and kathy baker breathe life into their portrayals and are all excellent, but harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real. you would swear he really is a trucker who drinks so he won't have to feel anything. baker as his put-upon sister also has some delicate moments - when deniro gives her flowers in one scene, it seems like she was never given flowers before and probably wasn't. very worthwhile.
