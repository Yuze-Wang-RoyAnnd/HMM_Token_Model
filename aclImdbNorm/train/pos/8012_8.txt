as far as the muppet line goes, however, this is not the best, nor the second best. this was marketed towards the kiddies, but has some dark, and emotionally upsetting adult moments, to which parents may not wish to expose their children. one of which showcases miss piggy going "postal" in a jealous rage, which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work.<br /><br />beyond that, however, the story is progressive, and highly entertaining. one scene in which joan rivers and miss piggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious! and there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and fun.<br /><br />i like this very much, and enjoy it still today.<br /><br />it rates a 7.6/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
