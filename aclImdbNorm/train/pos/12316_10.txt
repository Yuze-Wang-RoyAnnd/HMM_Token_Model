ching siu tung's and tsui hark's a chinese ghost story, aside from being one of the greatest wuxia pian films ever made, is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressively choreographed martial arts film that should belong in every film lover's collection. the sorely missed hong kong superstar leslie cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night at a haunted temple. while staying at the temple, he meets a colorful cast of characters that include the swordsmen yin (wu ma) and hsiao hou, the tree devil, and the beautiful ghost lit sin seen, played by the lovely joey wong.<br /><br />to free her from the clutches of the evil tree devil, he must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon.<br /><br />enough good things can't be said about this film. the pacing is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverishly paced finale should leave you with little chance to breathe. the chemistry between the wonderfully tragic joey wong and leslie cheung (whose legendary career ended much too soon) really allows the viewer to feel for both of them. indeed the acting on the whole is so vivacious and full of life, i would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences i've ever had. much of the credit goes to wu ma in his portrayal of the mysterious swordsman yin. his over-the-top persona of a disillusioned swordsman hell bent on vanquishing evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional hk drama. a wonderful score, lush cinematography with eye popping colors, and frenetic action pieces courtesy of ching siu tung round out this wonderful film. find a copy anywhere you can. 10/10
