the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening... was there a lot of symbolism?... the 2 goldfishes - do they mean something in thai culture? there's not much plot, not much happens and it just meanders along. no real start, no real middle and no real end. rather unsatisfying really.<br /><br />it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them...it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real. the move felt chaotic and disjointed. i don't know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve. maybe if i were thai it would make more sense...
