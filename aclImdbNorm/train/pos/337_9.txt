documenting a documenter. that's one way to describe keep the river on your right: a modern cannibal tale. this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to west papua and then peru. tobias is a full-bodied character: a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for. author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru, tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become. yet tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch. one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves.<br /><br />tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed. this film challenges the notions of morality and "naturalness"- e.g. nudity, homosexuality, cannibalism. (watch for the graphic circumcision scene). when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce, his non-judgmental nature asks: "why not?" who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong? this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national geographic types, but also those interested in the art of documentary making. this film shows what can be done shot on video. the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias' life that leaves you watching in fascination. at times, he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back, especially considering his age and physical frailty. we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself, perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one's place in the world. the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance, presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings (of homosexuality in this case) based on his personal interests. that said, you can't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle. move over river queen, this is the best river ride i've taken in a while.
