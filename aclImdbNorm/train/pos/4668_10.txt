this movie is now appearing on digital tv at least once a month, i've watched it a dozen or more times, and it never ceases to delight me. if it was on tomorrow i'd watch it again. such is the artistry that peter ustinov and maggie smith, two great magicians of the acting profession can create, helped in no small way by the superb supporting trio of karl malden, bob newhart and robert morley. not forgetting others in minor roles.<br /><br />it is a simple tale, simply told, of an ex-con, a lovable embezzler, battling and succeeding with the then "new age technology" i.e computers, and finding affection in the process. even if it is a tad (tongue in cheek) implausible, even unbelievable, the characters are not. there is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and best of all no awful method acting which is so prevalent today. a real lesson to modern movie-makers on how to make a great show from, and with, virtually nothing...except outstanding talent.
