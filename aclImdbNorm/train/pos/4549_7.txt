"my left foot" is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of christy brown, an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot, the only limb in his body he had control over. daniel day-lewis won his first oscar as best actor for this film, which i'm not absolutely certain was deserved, but is still noteworthy. day-lewis give brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch. brenda fricker, as brown's devoted mother, also won an oscar for a believable and touching role. my problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times. when brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot, the film can be difficult to watch. this gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time. however, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome. those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film, because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same thing. well made, occasionally enjoyable, but difficult to watch. may not be for everyone, but not bad at all.<br /><br />*** out of ****
