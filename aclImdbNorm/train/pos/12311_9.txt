"chinese ghost story" is one of the most amazing hong kong films i have ever seen.it's a brilliant mix of fantasy,comedy,romance,horror and martial arts.the film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights.i love especially the fight scene between wu ma and the tree demon tongue.truly original and refreshing film and another embalmer's fine recommendation.
