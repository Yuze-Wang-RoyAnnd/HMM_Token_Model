this movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get 2 get the hot chick. baseketball becomes a nationwide sport. joe cooper (trey parker) is the beloved captain, but is hated when he loses the nba to some other rival team. he meets the girl of his dreams yasmine bleeth, and in the end they kiss. the first time i saw this movie i wet my pants it was so funny. a definite must see for all comedy fans. if you love south park you'll love this! maybe don't watch with kids it is bit inappropriate for little dudes. some duds give it 6 1/2 out of ten, i give it 11 out of ten. i like coop he rocks i gotta go bye bye thanks for reading this
