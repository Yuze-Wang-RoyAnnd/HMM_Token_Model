i first saw this film when i was about 13. it blew me away then and in many respects it still does now. but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now. there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it. what we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side, beko and woods in 3d panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil.<br /><br />this all makes for a great film story, but it worries me that people see the portrayal as 'accurate'.
