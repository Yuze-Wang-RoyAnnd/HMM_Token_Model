a bunch of american students and their tutor decide to visit the ugliest part of ireland in order to study ancient religious practices. despite being repeatedly warned about the dangers of straying off the beaten path (by the local creepy irish guy, natch), they do just that, and wind up with their insides on the outside courtesy of a family of inbred cannibals (the descendants of the infamous sawney bean clan, who according to the film's silly plot, upped sticks from scotland and settled on the emerald isle).<br /><br />if you think that porn stars plus low budget horror automatically equals tons of nudity and terrible acting, then think again: evil breed is bristling with adult stars, but in fact, there's not nearly as much nudity as one might expect given the 'talent' involved, and the acting, although far from oscar worthy, ain't all that bad (with the exception of ginger lynn allen, who we know can do marvellous 'french', but whose irish is lousy).<br /><br />evil breed opens in superb style with the brutal slaughter of a couple of amorous campers: after some brief under-canvas sex, the silicone enhanced hottie is dragged from the tent and torn in half; the guy has his arms and legs cut off and is roasted on a spit. it's a very gory start, and bodes well for the rest of the film.<br /><br />unfortunately, after this promising beginning, things start to go seriously downhill: we are introduced to the main characters, an annoying bunch of twenty-somethings just begging to become cannibal chow, and are subjected to a fair amount of time wasting in the form of some terrible false scares, a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local irish weirdo gary (simon peacock), and worst of all, some sub-scream, post-modernistic conversation about the conventions of horror films (how clever!).<br /><br />then, just as it looks as though the film is never going to get any better, director christian viel decides to get serious: a guy gets a knife rammed through his head and there's a gratuitous sex-in-the-shower scene featuring lovely blonde gillian leigh (not a porn star, but i'm sure there's a career there waiting if she wants it). after that, things improve rapidly as the cannibals kick into top flesh-eating gear, and the film is transformed into a veritable bloodbath: gary has a machete rammed up his ass (about time!), and is strangled with his intestines; ginger lynn kick-boxes a mutant; jenna jameson is torn open, eviscerated and has her silicone breast implant gnawed on by confused cannibal; a guy gets decapitated by cheese wire; and taylor hayes is seen bloody, bruised and naked with a dead foetus between her legs (apparantly, she's been captured and used as breeding stock).<br /><br />all of this is so outrageously gory that it makes sitting through the less interesting stuff worthwhile, and earns evil breed a final rating of 7/10.<br /><br />nb. a very troubled production and studio meddling resulted in christian viel eventually abandoning the project. re-shoots were done and the gore was heavily trimmed for a us release. the good news is that although the film doesn't flow as well as it might have, and is cursed with a terrible ending, the uk dvd (the version i watched) seems to have been left relatively intact as far as the splatter is concerned (only 13s were cut from the film in total).
