saxophonist ronnie bowers (dick powell) wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood. he stays at hollywwod hotel (of course). at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall (lola lane) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture. in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia (rosemary lane) to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it's not marshall. naturally they fall in love. you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself.<br /><br />the plot is old (to put it nicely) but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices. the score is good (highlighted by "hooray for hollywood") and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive-in musical sequence (with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn). also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie.<br /><br />still the movie isn't that good. the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny. lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy. also there is racism--a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there's some truly appalling racist "humor" at one point. that's probably what keeps this off tv most of the time. i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today.<br /><br />all in all a so-so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs. i give it a 7.
