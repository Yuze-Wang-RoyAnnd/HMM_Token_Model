out of the first five episodes of hammer's short-running "hammer house of horror" series, this fifth episode with the wonderful title "the house that bled to death" is arguably the creepiest one. as a great fan of the hammer studios' gothic horror films for many years, i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently. so far, i've only seen the first five episodes, and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are, i will be satisfied. whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor, this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror. the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations. years later, william (nicholas ball) and emma peters (rachel davies) move in the house with their little daughter sophie (emma ridley). soon after moving in, however, the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house, which is seemingly haunted... the second episode directed by francis megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry, "growing pains" (episode 4), and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances. the film is also well-made in terms of effects, cinematography and score. "the house that bled to death" is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer-fans should like to see in a short horror tale. the film delivers a creepy atmosphere, genuine scare moments and intelligent twists, and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end. overall, this is highly recommendable to hammer fans.
