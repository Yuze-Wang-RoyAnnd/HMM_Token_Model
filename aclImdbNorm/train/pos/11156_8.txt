i typically don't like reality shows, particularly the ones that are profiting off of "american idol"'s success. but this one i can live with.<br /><br />comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts, and if they like them, those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience. then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do "survivor" style competitions using comedic tactics. then one will be determined as "last comic standing." i do like stand up comedy, so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests. there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through. it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden, ralphie may, and josh blue.<br /><br />my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama. at first they lived together in a house like "big brother," but now they've done away with that, thank god.<br /><br />and there are a lot of comedians i felt, were only chosen not because they're funny, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc. when other comics clearly should've beaten them out. but overall, it's a well-made reality show, which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron.
