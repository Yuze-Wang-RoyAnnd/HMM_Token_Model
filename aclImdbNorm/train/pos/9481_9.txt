xiao chen zhi chun is a great movie, not only in the year it was shot but also now. it's an art movie which is not outdated even in 21st century. the director maintained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth!<br /><br />the movie reminds me of the later french new wave movie: francois truffaut's "femme d'a cote" which is of the similar topic.
