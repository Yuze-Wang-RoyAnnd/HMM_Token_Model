eglimata (= crimes) is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disaster.one of the smartest greek series ever!actors like ketty konstadinou and maria kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible 'guilty' laughing.every viewer seemed to recognise the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had. actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in greek audience's heart.my personal favourites (apart the first two i mentioned)are vassilis haralambopoulos, athinodoros prousalis and stavros nikolaidis but so many amazing actors passed by some episodes from time to time. whoever around the world understands greek should find a way to watch this series,even though it's been more than 5 years that it was on tv.in greece they keep repeating the series (ant1) in every chance there is like summertime or early afternoon zones.we'll never forget eglimata or any of the casting crew!
