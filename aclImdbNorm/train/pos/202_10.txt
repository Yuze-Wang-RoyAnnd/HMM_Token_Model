a give this movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. two of the best actors of their time-walter matthau & george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film + director herbert ross, and all of that makes this stage adaption come true. the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70's. i love the type of humor in this film, it just makes me laugh so hard.<br /><br />i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago (yes, vhs because it was cheaper-only $3). i watched it as soon as i got home, but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time. the second time i watched it, it felt a lot better, and i laughed a lot harder. i'm definitely going to re-get this on dvd because i have to see the special features.<br /><br />it's very funny how that happens. two people work together as entertainers/actors/performers. they get along well on stage, but really argue off stage, they can't survive another minute with each other, then some 15 years later, you want to reunite them for a tv special. you can find that in this film. matthau & burns were terrific in this film. it's a damn shame they died. george burns deserved that oscar. he gave a strong comic performance. he was also 78 when this movie was filmed. so far, he's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age. jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. richard benjamin was also fantastic in this. he won a golden globe for best supporting actor. he deserved that golden globe. although many people might disagree with what i am about to say, everybody in this film gave a strong performance. this comedy is an instant classic. i highly recommend it. one more thing: whoever hates this film is a "putz"
