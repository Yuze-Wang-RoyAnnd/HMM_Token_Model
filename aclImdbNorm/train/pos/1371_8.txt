this film is a delightful, light hearted look at both sides of where the "club kid" rave scene blends with the new york art, music and performance art worlds (with a cameo by the omnipresent miss bunny). this is "torch song trilogy" for the perky-post-teen girls. "that girl" for our disaffected, affected millennium times.<br /><br />the dialogue is fast and funny, and parker posey's costumer deserves - if not an academy award, at least - a stadium "wave" of kudos.<br /><br />of course, this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of miss posey, and she is perfectly cast. like a lot of her acting work, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referential and, well, posey... but it all works. she is a talented comedienne, an incredible entertainer, and this film entertains, she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap, and never lets it drop to the floor.<br /><br />mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn't above stealing designer clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend. on a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care-less in every sense of the word, including about other people; and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life. <br /><br />the script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt, in a role that was much too one-dimensional and heavy handed; a more nuanced performance from her, would have deepened the relationship between the two... but... hey... this is comedy. a surprisingly deep role, that gives this film some substance and world vision, is the fallafel selling boyfriend. we should all be so lucky... is he the one for mary? or the one that gets away? <br /><br />i rate this as a 8 because it isn't a great moment of film history, it is not a classic, and it is not great art (all of which get deeper and richer on re-viewing). like "desperately seeking susan" it represents something very true about it's time period, but may become irrelevant with time. still, it has everything an entertaining film needs, and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone!
