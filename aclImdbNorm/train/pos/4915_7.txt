and a rather unexpected plot line too-for the era: there is plague in the city of new orleans-and only richard widmark can stop it! elia kazan's trademark subjects: waterfronts, working men, crowds, fugitives, blue collar folk, violence on a backstreet-are all showcased here.<br /><br />jack palance is quite effective as the ice-cold mobster out for a big score, zero mostel as dom delouise somewhat miscast but certainly watchable as his go-fer. i enjoyed barbara bel geddes as the stalwart, cool wife-i thought she and widmark were a believable couple.<br /><br />he himself always reminds me somewhat of sinatra-in the face and in the intense quiet manner-and that is meant as a compliment if anything. i'd never even heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire widmark's performance. i also enjoyed paul douglas-he seemed to play this role many times, they make an unlikely but effective team.<br /><br />the plague itself is a mcguffin-and you gotta know it's not exactly done the way it would have been in real life-rather small-scale at the least no?-but i found it carried the plot along nicely.<br /><br />check this out. it's good. *** outta ****
