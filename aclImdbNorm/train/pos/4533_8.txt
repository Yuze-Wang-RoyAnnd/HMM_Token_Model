first time of seeing buster keaton's first feature film and i have to admit i liked it a lot and only wish i'd stumbled across it years ago. the rohauer blurb at the start warns that the three ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion, and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated. so, it's rocky viewing in places, but i've seen and survived much worse.<br /><br />it would have been ok as the 3 short films but as a take on intolerance it's inventive and funny from the start to the finish: in the stone age with baddie wallace beery riding an elephant and goodie buster riding a pet brontosaurus; in the roman age buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging, no parking signs in latin; in this technological age of speed need and greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump. both him and beery are after the girl through the ages, a never ending tussle. favourite bit: as the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera - an amazing second or two!<br /><br />great stuff, reaffirming my love of silent film comedy.
