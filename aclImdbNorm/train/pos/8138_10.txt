cb4 was awful, but it may have given cundieff the idea to it better. more like spinal tap than anything else, the film is clever from the start. surprising anyone who saw it back in the mid nineties. the performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters, more like marx brothers. these guys are real and slightly diverse. they react to situations like any of us might. well, we may not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late to the gig, or pull guns and beat down a record company exec, but you get the picture. n(n***as) w(with) h(hats) takes itself seriously enough to reel you in, then you're hooked. rent or get this at all costs, even if you're not really into rap music, this will still leave you gassing out loud. comparing this to cb4 is like comparing george lucas' star wars to gil gerards'buck rogers' i think you see my point
