another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peaks, also aptly. yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non-critically and black comedy, also well worth consideration.<br /><br />watch the whole thing, all three series. at the end, all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel. the detail and intricacies are staggering. thoroughly post-modern. wickedly funny, and startlingly tragic. not for kids. not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity. thought-provoking. at once literal, figurative, and surreal in disturbing ways. the blackest comedy i can recall.<br /><br />and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see.
