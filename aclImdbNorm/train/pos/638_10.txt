to anyone who might think this show isn't for them, please give it a try. network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people. this show is a return to family oriented tv where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons, learning what real friends and family are about, and maybe even learning a little bit about our national pastime. jeremy sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today, and he is perfectly cast as the young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictional new york empires (great name!). dean cain, christopher lloyd, mare winningham, and kirsten storms round out the main cast, and they are all exceptional. this show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen. hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch pete young (sumpter's character) learn and grow.
