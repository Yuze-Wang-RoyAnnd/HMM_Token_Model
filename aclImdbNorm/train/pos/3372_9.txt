its time to pay tribute to the great charton heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one. his other films of a past generation were ben hur, the ten commandents, omega man and planet of the apes were his better works.<br /><br />this film made in 1973 attempts to prophesies a future earth , in 2022, that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called "soylent green" which is manufactured with human flesh. this bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes india's population which would be about 2 billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing it.<br /><br />charlton heston's character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalism.<br /><br />unfortunately for the producers of this film the green message they deliver is not the greens party of today's ethos thank god. cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in new zealand , fiji and borneo up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization.<br /><br />another silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made.<br /><br />the film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great edward g. robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons.<br /><br />this is a dud of a film and i wouldn't even recommend it to baby boomers or charlton heston fans. all the other reviews of this film i have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the usa in which an ecological disaster has occurred.<br /><br />the only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation.
