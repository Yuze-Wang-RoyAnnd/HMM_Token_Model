this animated movie is a masterpiece! the narration, music, animation, and storyline where all remarkable. my girlfriend and i saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it. we invited a couple friends to see spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot. when i asked them to come along to see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but afterwards they realized it was more than that. i liked esperanza, spirit, rain, and lil' creek, who reminds me of nathan chasing horse who is smiles a lot in dances with wolves. spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that i found to be empowering and inspirational.<br /><br />i saw spirit for a third time and i want to go see it again. i enjoyed "spirit" tremendously because its portrayal of american indians is realistic, dignified, and non-stereotypical unlike the movie "the road to el dorado", which was a total farce because it portrayed american indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way. but dreamworks has redeemed themselves by making spirit a great movie that i found to be acceptable! i hope they continue to make more animated movies like spirit, and i would like to see sequels or spinoffs to spirit if its done respectfully and without stereotyping american indians.<br /><br />i highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see spirit: stallion of the cimarron.
