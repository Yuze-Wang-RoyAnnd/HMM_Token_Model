i really really love this show! i have always liked the 1990's shows of space ghost! this show was hilarious and i can't believe why cartoon network's adult swim would take such a funny show like this off the air. i hope they put this show on dvd or something. the show is about brak (from the space ghost cartoons, sgcc and cartoon planet) who lives his every day life with his mom and dad and his best friend who likes to drop in a lot, zorak! my favorite episodes were the one where zorak gets this really good singing voice and then his voice doesn't give him any money that zorak made from singing at all. another episode i like is the one where brak and zorak didn't finish their homework and then they go back from sunday to friday and they just goof off and then they go back to the day homework was invented and then when they go back to the present homework didn't exist! another episode i like is the one where brak's dad and their next door neighbor, thundercleese the robot keep getting into this agrument and then they get eaten by a giant worm. another episode i liked was the one where zorak makes a bully stand and then some new guy took over his stand. i also like a lot of the other episodes! one thing that never fails to make me laugh is when zorak is getting beaten up, blasted and zapped!
