this movie is simply incredible! i had expected something quite different form the film that i actually saw. however, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior. let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual, for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high-brow sort of pornography. it even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape.<br /><br />meanwhile, i strongly suggest seeing this rare work of "sexual art". every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies, by the way. one should not forget how times have changed!<br /><br />go see it! it's worth your money and time!
