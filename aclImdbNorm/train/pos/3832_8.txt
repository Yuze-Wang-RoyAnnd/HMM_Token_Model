late one night on a desolate road, in an empty saloon martin sheen spins a yarn for robert carradine of hopalong cassidy and friends tracking a group of murderous cattle rustlers, who've killed a few men and kidnapped cassidy's girl.<br /><br />writer/director christopher coppola may have incurred the wrath of william boyd purists by daring to make a modern low budget film featuring their beloved hoppy, but i'm glad he did it! no character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again!<br /><br />i thought it was good fun and an interesting updating of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. though guilty of some bad acting, this is earnest enough and unpretentious, making it hard for me to dislike.<br /><br />the whole production is a bit odd though, but i really enjoyed the scenes between sheen and carridine. the fact that we're watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable.
