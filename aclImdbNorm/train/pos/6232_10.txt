one of the best of the fred astaire and giner rogers films. great music by irving berlin. solid support from randolph scott, harriet nelson, lucille ball, betty grable, frank jenks, and astrid allwyn.<br /><br />terrific songs include "let yourself go," "let's face the music," and "putting all my eggs in one basket." the last song is introduced by astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with rogers. rogers also sings "let yourself go" with grable among the backup singers.<br /><br />harriet nelson (then hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays rogers' mousy sister. "get thee behind me" is a song that sticks with you for days. she also sings "but where are you?" snappy and fast paced, this entry in the astaire-rogers series is one of the better ones. the classic and amazing beautiful finale, "let's face the music and dance" is among the best-known of their numbers. rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history.... a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances (weighted hem) and is also slightly see through. just gorgeous. this is the number that steve martin and bernadette peters re-created in pennies from heaven.<br /><br />randolph scott seems an odd choice as astaire's pal but he also appeared in their roberta with irene dunne. luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance. it seems that grable and ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact. allwyn has the bigger role but is only ok.<br /><br />rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with "let yourself go".... jazzy and thumping, it's a great song.<br /><br />fun all the way, although i got tired of "we joined the navy" after the third time....
