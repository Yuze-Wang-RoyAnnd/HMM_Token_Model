although this was not without its faults, this drama was a fitting one to be shown around easter time. it reminded us of our spiritual selves and showed that behind our facades, we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences. there was so much to enjoy in the drama, not least the rapping teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background. the acting was excellent and timothy spall was once again superb. the climax was very satisfying, if rather simplistic. timothy spall's "letting go" of his long-dead wife's suicide was credible and mirrored well the feelings of despair that were present in the teenage girl who self-harmed. the resolution between the graffiti boy and the muslim was gratifying but less believable. a wonderful drama which left myself and my husband felling that the evening had been well spent. congratulations!
