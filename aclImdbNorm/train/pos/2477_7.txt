grand epic as it is, kenneth branagh's monumental rendering of what is perhaps william shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power. two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making. while i absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such, i must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance, his rhetoric (and he sends himself up so well) and his many flourishes. thus "hamlet" loses its impact as it loses its grip.<br /><br />from patrick doyle's music to alex thomson's cinematography to tim harvey's exquisite sets, the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights, which compliments a fine cast. branagh has taken on three huge mantels, adapting, directing and playing. his adaptation is superb, his direction strong, but by the time he got to the role of hamlet, the strain seemed to be showing; yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role. derek jacobi gobbles up the sinister claudius with glee, and julie christie is most dramatic as his queen, gertrude. richard briers is marvellous as polonius, and charlton heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player king. many others drop by, including jack lemmon (superb in a very small role), billy crystal, dame judi dench, sir john mills, sir john gielgud, sir richard attenborough and gerard depardieu. the acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years, kate winslet. hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair, ophelia.<br /><br />to finish (before this review goes on longer than the film), i must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie. branagh has directed with purpose, giving many important, impacting scenes. too many of them outstay their welcome. watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it. "neither a lender nor a borrower be" or "be true to thyself". and of course: "to be or not to be".<br /><br />the opening two hours does take some perseverance, but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward.<br /><br />monday, june 8, 1998 - hoyts croydon
