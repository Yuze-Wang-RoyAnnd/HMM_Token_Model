in an era of such awful cartoons, i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies.<br /><br />this movie does contradict the first. i won't deny that. however, when i was in the target age group for this movie, i didn't even notice, nor would it have mattered if i did. the people who made it may have used "new generation" to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began. perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began.<br /><br />this was my favorite movie at age 3-6, and it did not scare me or confuse me at all.<br /><br />
