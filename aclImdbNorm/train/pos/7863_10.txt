this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars. it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to. plus the bomb blast scene is very real.<br /><br />what you read and are taught just does not happen!!!<br /><br />can raise your bp level by 10%<br /><br />all actors played their role very well.<br /><br />some scenes may / could have been avoided to include teenagers.<br /><br />this movie is quite adult in nature.<br /><br />not a movie that can be seen with family.<br /><br />casting is great!!!
