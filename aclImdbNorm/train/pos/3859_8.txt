paul verhoeven's de vierde man (the fourth man) is one of the most compelling thrillers i have ever seen. it really was a pleasant surprise. the story concerns bi-sexual writer gerard (jeroen krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser christine (ren'ee soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of gerard there could be more to the story. verhoeven and cinematographer jan de bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery, this really pulls you into the story, you don't want to watch, but you can't turn yourself away. this is by far verhoeven's best film (maybe second only to robocop). true the fourth man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked. this is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, a true whodunit it in the hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and thrilling. i even like the spider metaphor.<br /><br /> 8/10
