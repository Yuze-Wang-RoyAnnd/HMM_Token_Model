i used to watch this show when i was a little girl. although i don't remember much about it, i must say that it was a pretty good show. also, i don't think i've seen every episode. however, if you ask me, it was still a good show. i vaguely remember the theme song. everyone was ideally cast, the costume design was great. the performances were top-grade, too. i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i don't think i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back on the air, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
