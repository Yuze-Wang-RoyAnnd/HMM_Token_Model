watching david&bathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to sunday school. despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining. the studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for. peck portrays king david as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy bathsheba, susan hayward. raymond massey as the prophet nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance. look for the silent screen star francis x. bushman as king saul and a young gwen verdon as a dancer. hooray for the old testament and hollywood.
