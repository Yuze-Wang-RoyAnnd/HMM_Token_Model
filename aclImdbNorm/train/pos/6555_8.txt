i have read over 100 of the nancy drew books, and if you are not bright enough to catch on yet, nancy drew the movie was of a younger nancy drew, not the 18-year-old that doesn't go to school that all of the books are about. this was when she was sixteen. so naturally, she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the 10th grade. other than that, i thought the movie was very cute. it was clean and appropriate for everyone. it was funny at times. i thought emma roberts did a great job. she was articulate, in character, and cute. i liked the awkwardness that nancy and ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books. it was a cute, pg movie that i throughly enjoyed because i, unlike most people my age, enjoy movies without sex, drugs, or profanity.
