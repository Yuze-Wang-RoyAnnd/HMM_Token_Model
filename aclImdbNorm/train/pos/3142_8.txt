in what is a truly diverse cast, this show hits it's stride on fox. it is the kind of sitcom that grows on you. if you just watch 1 show you might not like it much, but once you watch two or three- you get hooked.<br /><br />this is because some of the jokes hit & some miss depending upon how you view them. as is usual today, the themes are very mature. the humor is usually very mature too. often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones.<br /><br />red (kurtwood smith) a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show. debra jo rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too. danny masterson, the oldest actor of the "kids" is very good too. laura prepon (donna) looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead (who got the idea of making her a blonde?). she shows very good talent & comedic timing often. she looks good without make up too.<br /><br />this is one of the better entries on fox in the sitcom department & it's most successful live action one since married with children
