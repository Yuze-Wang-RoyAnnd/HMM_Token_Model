this movie came to me highly recommended by matt groening. well actually i watched both the simpsons and futurama and it gets a mention in both so i figured "what the heck". the film brings home a few "what if's" that make you realise how lucky we are in this day and age where we take simple things like soap and water for granted. interesting though that in the year 2022 men are still shaving with a single blade safety razor! nice that those responsible didn't over load the film with unnecessary special effects, ray guns, etc. some nice looking 'furniture' once you figure out what that means. remember, "tuesday is soylent green day"
