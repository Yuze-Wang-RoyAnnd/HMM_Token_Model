hmmm, yeah this episode is extremely underrated.<br /><br />even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts. i think the good over wins the bad. <br /><br />i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end. i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony. it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1. <br /><br />for some reason, people have always hated the reincarnation episodes, yet i have always liked them. they're not the best, in terms of writing. but the theme really does interest me,<br /><br />i'm gonna give it a three star, but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four.
