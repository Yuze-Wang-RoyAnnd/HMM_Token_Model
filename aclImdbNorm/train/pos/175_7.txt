a pretty average movie but a brave one from ms hawn to promote this vehicle as exec producer & as a starring vehicle. although she ends up vindicated, she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo. how many other a listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury pratfalls since this movie? not many. does this mean the female butt cannot be funny? goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona & ventures in projects other won't. sandra bullock occasionally goes there,for example, miss congeniality but nicole kidman would never cop the pratfall. a wonderful performer. great to see some of my favorite actors, chris sarandon & cliff deyoung notably.
