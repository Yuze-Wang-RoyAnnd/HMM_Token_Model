deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom, as it primarily takes place on one set. the premise is that an accomplished playwright, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play, to the (loud) protests of his wife. or so you think, for the first half of the movie. past the halfway mark, deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head, then right around, and then in a mad spin, all the time keeping its title appropriate. it's an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit. <br /><br />michael caine, as the senior playwright, plays himself in this movie - a slightly loony and very dramatic brit. no surprises here - he does his usual good work. he gets the best line of deathtrap, which he executes perfectly: "what is your definition of success, being gang-banged in a state penitentiary?" <br /><br />christopher reeve, on the other hand, juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. he also gets to show off his very toned body, which he must've retained coming off the superman movies. <br /><br />caine and reeve have collaborated in another movie that's one of my favorite comedies - noises off. it similarly revolves around a play as well, although this time caine is the director and reeve is an actor. they are joined by comic veterans carol burnett, john ritter, marilu henner (taxi) and mark linn-baker (perfect strangers). together, they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed-hopping cast and crew of a play. on the surface, the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch. wish this underrated movie was available on dvd.
