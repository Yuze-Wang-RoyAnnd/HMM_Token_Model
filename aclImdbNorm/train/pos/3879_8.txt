a typical clausen film, but then again not typical. clausen writes, directs and play one of the leading roles. this is really a great film about normal people living normal lives trying to make the best of it. the 4 primary actors were fantastic.<br /><br />fritz helmut was convincing. you believe that he really is sick.<br /><br />sonja richter plays a nurse that really is an actor, but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man.<br /><br />everybody has problems and those who nobody believes in ends up being happy. but nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to win their life and love.
