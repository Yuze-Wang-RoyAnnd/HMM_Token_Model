fate/stay night is an animated series inspired by a h-game. somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h-stuff. it couldn't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection.(you'll understand once you see all the episodes).<br /><br />despite a relatively slow start (the producer took his time on presenting the characters) things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid-series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat.<br /><br />the topic of the series concentrates on the war of holy grail that has been taking place in the fukuky city for the last 50 years. the pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on. shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city.he unwillingly witnesses a fight between two servants that triggers his reiju (holy mark) to summon one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield, saber. his first contact with saber left him stunned "such immeasurable beauty ...i was at a lost for words". <br /><br />you mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot. fsn offers much more than some cool sword fights, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, it offers excellent character and relationship development. it presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate. the action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals (not similar to the linear type other series use) that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal, from under the mask of perfection, flawed characters.<br /><br />the saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such. you shouldn't watch fsn thinking that it doesn't present the viewer with the historic fact, just remember that this is adventure/fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can. the ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes i would have watched them in the same breath.
