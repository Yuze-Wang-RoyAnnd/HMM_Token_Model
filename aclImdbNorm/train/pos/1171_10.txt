i found this episode to be one of funniest i've seen in a long time. the south park creators have done the best spoof of a romero film i have ever seen.they have truly touched on romero's underlying social commentary that he has made with each one of his films. i would love to know what george romero's opinion was on this episode i'm sure it was purely positive! keeping his true vision for his zombie epics fully intact! most spoofs deal with the pure gore without making the viewer think as romero tries to do with his films. i think that if a zombie outbreak did happen we may actually worry about our property values before our lives as shown in this episode!
