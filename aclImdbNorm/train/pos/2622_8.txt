everyone, my name may sound weird, but there was nothing else! <br /><br />any way, i haven't seen anything like this before so it was crazy! of course that's a good thing. it is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one! like chicken little,, the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying, "twas beauty who killed the beast", war of the worlds scene and more. walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one. also, how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. <br /><br />however some parts don't fit. like in the original lion king, weren't timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar? in this movie, they are not! they were fighting the hyenas backstage. ther's more, the reason being why pumbaa isn't so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also, it's just timon, timon, timon. anybody realise that only timonn's story was told, whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks?<br /><br />but apart from that , it"s great!
