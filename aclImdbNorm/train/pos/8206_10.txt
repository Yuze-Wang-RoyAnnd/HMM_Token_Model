clint eastwood returns as dirty harry calahan in the 4th movie of the dirty harry series. clint is older but he's still got it, harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery (where the memorable "make my day" catchphrase comes from!) but the city he took a vacation was worse, a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one. the last movie to see sandra locke in a clint eastwood movie! an improvement after the enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. clint eastwood's sunglasses were gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by arnold shwartzeneger in the terminator. worth a watch if you like clint eastwood, the dirty harry films or like action crime thrillers.
