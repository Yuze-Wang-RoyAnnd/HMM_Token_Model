other than susan hayward's wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made. henry king handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes, and peck is, as always, impeccable. the stirring alfred newman sound score, with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years. the scene with goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made. this goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day, "the song of ruth" and "esther and the king." it is worth watching, and raymond massy is excellent as the prophet nathan. the film is rounded out by the always fine james robertson justice as abishai and jayne meadows as michol, david's estranged first wife.
