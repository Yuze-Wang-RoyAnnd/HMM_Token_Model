by hook or by crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers, harry dodge and silas howard. they manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style, and it's beautifully shot by ann t. rosetti, and wonderfully written -- truly poetic. <br /><br />the lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model/inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere. this film has so much energy, so much poignant passion and scruffy san francisco heart to it. i can't recommend it highly enough! <br /><br />the best butch buddy movie of all time!
