this is just as good as the original 101 if not better. of course, cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of cruella. we see a lot more of her this time round. i also like ioan gruffudd as kevin, the rather bumbling male lead. to use paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea. the movie is well worth watching whatever your age, provided you like animals.
