i saw this movie in 1959 when i was 11 years old at a drive-in theater with my family.<br /><br />way back then, i thought it was very funny . . . even though i was too young to understand 90% of what makes this marvelous movie such a delight! i saw it again this morning on "turner south". as i watched it, i was absolutely convulsed with laughter! "the mating game" is a unique classic from a by-gone age. if you're too young to have experienced the enchanting period in history that produced this film, i feel very sorry for you. there's no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can (even today) deliver such a delightful slice of heaven to "old timers" like me.<br /><br />having said that, all i can do is respectfully request that younger people refrain from commenting on films like "the mating game".<br /><br />movies like this were made for the generation that preceded the current group of your people. and as such, these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand.<br /><br />in other words
