yes, this production is long (good news for bronte fans!) and it has a somewhat dated feel, but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won't want to watch any other versions!<br /><br />timothy dalton is edward rochester... it's that simple. i don't care that other reviewers claim he's too handsome. dalton is attractive, certainly, but no pretty-boy. in fact he possesses a craggy, angular dark charm that, in my mind, is quite in keeping with the mysterious, very masculine mr r. and he takes on rochester's sad, tortured persona so poignantly. he portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it, but also displays rochester's tender, passionate, emotional side as well. (imo the newer a&e production suffers in that ciaran hinds - whom i normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout. i've read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast.)<br /><br />when i reread the novel, i always see zelah clarke as jane. ms. clarke, to me, resembles jane as she describes herself (and is described by others). small, childlike, fairy... though it's true the actress doesn't look 18, she portrays jane's attributes so well. while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional, one must remember that the character spent 8 years at lowood being trained to hold her emotions and "passionate nature" in check. her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen, who was the picture of demure submission. although her true nature was dissimilar, jane learned to master her temper and appear docile, in keeping with the school's aims for its charity students who would go into 'service'. jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich mr. rochester. she would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal. even later on when she gave as well as she got, she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer. nevertheless, if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles zelah-as-jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered.<br /><br />the chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right, i think. no, it does not in the least resemble hollywood (thank god! it's not a hollywood sort of book) but theirs is a romance which is true, devoted and loyal. and for a woman like jane, who never presumed to have *any* love come her way, it is a minor miracle.<br /><br />the rest of the casting is terrific, and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here. so, too, is much of the rich, poetic original dialogue. this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely, infamous 'gypsy scene' and in general, features more humor than other versions i've seen. in particular, the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful!<br /><br />jane eyre was, in many ways, one of the first novelized feminists. she finally accepted love on her own terms and independently, and, at last, as rochester's true equal. just beautiful!
