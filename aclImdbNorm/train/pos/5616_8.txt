what can be said, really... "the tenant" is a first-class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia. it's an intricately-plotted film--every detail seems included for a reason--even though the plot seldom makes sense, and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner. therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky (polanski)--a meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide--to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty. after an apartment-warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers, trelkovsky comes under increased, seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu*k on par with the later efforts of david lynch. "the tenant," however, is more brooding and sinister, laced with unexpected comic relief, fine performances, and a truly haunting score. it's a movie that's better experienced than described, so hop to it.
