is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story? maybe, hell, you know how the formula works by now, pretty woman is introduced in to a picture, someone has to fall in love with her.<br /><br />i think this film does follow some typical story lines, but that doesn't say anything about the content. there are great scenes with crispen glover, dennis hopper, and gary busey, although short. some things didn't make sense, such as the need to get in to random fights, but it is entertaining to watch, the fights were actually well done.<br /><br />this is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it. the humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach on this, but you will keep a smile.<br /><br />there is a little bit of steamy action, so not one for the kids.
