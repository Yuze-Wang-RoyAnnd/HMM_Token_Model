i really didn't expect much from this movie, but it wasn't bad; actually it was quite good. this movie contained a couple of the funniest bits of writing i have ever seen from a motion picture. now am not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but i laughed pretty hard at some parts. "the police ruled my father's death a suicide. they said he fell down an elevator shaft. onto some bullets". now this movie is not for everybody, its mostly stupid humor like zoolander or dodgeball; so if you hated these movies i would probably recommend you to steer clear. overall it was an enjoyable movie, about a group of superhero wannabes, who end up becoming real heroes in the end. it's a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet, because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage. after viewing this film, i finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes ben stiller, william h. macy, hank azaria, and even that kid from good burger. it's because mystery man is full of excellent comedic writing period 7 out of 10. a very big surprise.
