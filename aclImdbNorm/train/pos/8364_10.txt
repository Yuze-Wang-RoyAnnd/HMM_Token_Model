robot jox doesn't suffer from story or bad effects. i mean, this was 1990 if you know what i'm talking about. robocop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the '80s. if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time. it wasn't until terminator 2: judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized, and story boarders began to use that motive. but you'll have fond memories of transformers, gundam wing, even power rangers, if you watch this film. the enemy robot is very menacing. it makes you not want to face the man without a really good back-up plan. and there are some great moments within this film. a traitor/spy is working within their midsts. who you think is on your side, backing you up all the way, could be the person you didn't expect him/her to be. and that's very troublesome to think so, don't you agree?
