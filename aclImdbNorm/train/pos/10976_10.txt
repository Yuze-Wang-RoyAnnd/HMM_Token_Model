this is why i so love this website ! i saw this film in the 1980's on british television. over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life. with barely a few key words to remember it by, i traced the film here, and much information, including the fact it's about to become an off-broadway musical !<br /><br />interestingly, unlike the previous comment maker, i do not remember finding this film sad, or exploitative. on the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength, honour and dignity. ironic you may think, considering the squalor of their lives. maybe it's because i live in britain, where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money, where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding; i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit, deep and profound humour, whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect. in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult'. over the years, as it faded in my mind, it shone the brightest, above all others as a one off brilliant & outstanding televisual experience. it was such a deeply private expose, it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical. but perhaps somewhere, the daughter will be amused by such an outcome. it is she who will have the last laugh maybe..(they made a musical out of her before you jackie o' )
