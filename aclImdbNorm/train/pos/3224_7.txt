i watched this movie expecting what i got: good sci-fi cowboy stuff. what really surprised me was that kurt russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role.<br /><br />imagine trying to act under these two restraints: you have hardly any dialogue, and because you are playing a hardass, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! howzat? kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped. in spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed, russell pulls off an incredible characterization. his robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints. great job!<br /><br />as usual, jason isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered. connie nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous. i'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take one's eyes off her. unfortunately, gary busey's role was too small and limited. <br /><br />much of the plot is quite standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling, i don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. by the end of the story the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. yes!<br /><br />the sort of feeb who thinks that russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point.
