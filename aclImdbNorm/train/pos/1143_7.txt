i don't watch soaps. my grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass. i made fun of them it when i was ten (it was so easy).<br /><br />but this movie takes parody and spells it a new way. i found the story pretty damn funny. the fashions of the 80's - shoulder pads, sequins, and polyester - just top it off. the huge hair, the high heels, and the histrionics - what a combination.<br /><br />and all the actors just go to town, chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile. sally, kevin, elisabeth - wonderful! whoopi - great! robert downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential, before the tabloids. and garry: why did we have to wait so long to see him on film? leesa gibbons - hadn't been missing her, but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for that job, anyway?).<br /><br />admittedly, i could have done without sally climbing the drainpipe. lucy ricardo did it, how many times?, as has every comedienne from carol burnett to i don't know who and i'm so done with it now, i could spit peanuts if i had them. apparently it's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in new york. i'm just thankful they didn't pull out the flagpole bit.<br /><br />but it was cute, it was funny, it had plot twists, it had an after credits ending before that was common, it had clothes worthy of a second glance, it had a great cast and it's got personal memories for me. really, what more do you need?
