mgm were unsure of how to market garbo when she first arrived in hollywood. mayer had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in "torrent" justified that. she did not speak a word of english so she must have found it difficult to work, also ricardo cortez did not make it very easy for her.<br /><br />the torrent of the title is the river juscar that winds through a sleepy little village in spain. leonora (greta garbo) hopes someday that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. leonora and don rafael (ricardo cortez) are in love but he is under his mother's thumb and cannot get her to consent to his marriage. meanwhile dona brull (martha mattox) has evicted leonora's parents from their home and they send leonora to paris hoping to give her a chance to further her singing career. leonora sends a note to rafael, urging him to remember his promise and come with her. his mother is enraged and forbids him to go - so of course he caves in to her request.<br /><br />years pass. leonora has a new identity - she has become la brunna, the toast of the paris opera. rafael has turned out just as his mother wished - he is running for office and is courting a "safe" young girl, remedios (gertrude olmstead) who is a "hog" heiress. mack swain plays her father. leonora decides to visit her old home, and i agree - why hasn't she helped her mother out. her mother is still living at the family home, working as a skivvy and taking in washing. leonora and rafael meet but leonora is full of ridicule. garbo is so enchantingly beautiful, it is hard to believe that he could be happy with remedios.<br /><br />the dam is bursting and the torrent is flooding the town. leonora's house is in the path of the raging river but when rafael attempts to rescue her he finds she is quite safe. they then re-kindle their romance. there is a "horizontal" love scene in this film, very similar to the one in "flesh and the devil".<br /><br />dona brull goes spreading gossip about how leonora really got her wealth and leonora's mother believes her and tells leonora to go. rafael meets leonora just before she is about to tour america. again he intends to go with her but again he lets her down. he spends so much time listening to other people destroy her reputation - "what will she do for you but drag you down". the irony is she has just secured a top government job for him if he comes with her. they meet again, years later - she is as fresh and vibrant as ever - he looks older than his years, bowed down by mediocrity.<br /><br />it is certainly a good film with a positive message to follow your heart.<br /><br />lucien littlefield does a good job as cupido, the barber and leonora's old and faithful friend.<br /><br />highly recommended.
