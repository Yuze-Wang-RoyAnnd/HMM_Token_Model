i saw this movie years ago on late night television. back then it went by the title of "stairway to heaven". even as a young boy, i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what i'm talking about). such imagination! a perfect blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made: citizen kane, casablanca, gone with the wind. this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. what a pity. i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1 (north america), so that 1), i can purchase it, and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
