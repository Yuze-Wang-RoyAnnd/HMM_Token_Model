along with darkwing duck this is unfairly cancelled. disney has been in decline since tarzan and we need a show like this to get disney back on track. ed gilbert and jim cummings were perfect for the voices of louis and baloo (sounds familiar?) the theme theme tune is also catchy. out of all the villains, which are all great on their own merits, tony jay stands out as shere kahn. louis and baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the jungle book, which isn't a bad thing at all. as a matter of fact, it's quite inspirational! the animation was spot on, and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years. please bring this show back! 9/10. bethany cox
