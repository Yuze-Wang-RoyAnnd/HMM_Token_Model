surely one of the best british films ever made, if not one of the best films ever made anywhere. script, cinematography, direction and acting in a class on their own. this film works on so many levels. so why is it completely unavailable on tape, dvd. never shown on tv? why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the national film theatre in london to packed houses?
