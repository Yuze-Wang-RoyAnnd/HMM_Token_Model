this is one of disney's top five animated features, in my opinion. cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length feature animation film (as opposed to the compilation films of the 40's), and expensive depth via the multi-plane camera returns to the film in no other way. although disney adapts the story somewhat liberally, you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations---a clear time period the story takes place.<br /><br />cinderella is more mature than snow white, and a multi-dimensional character. actually, all of the characters are somewhat well-developed, except for the prince--left the most flat--we know he has a sense of humor, and a great smile, but that's about all. like snow white, disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture---in most versions of cinderella, the stepsisters are attractive, just not as pretty as cinderella, and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance.<br /><br />favorite disney additions: the mice! also, appreciated the continuity--cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. the addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a child--i remember view master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it! the broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil lady tremaine to give up her hold over cinderella and admit defeat---audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all disney villains, satanic witch maleficent, in sleeping beauty.
