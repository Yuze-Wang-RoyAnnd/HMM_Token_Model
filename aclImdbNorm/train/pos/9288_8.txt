i found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950's culture-clash movie. john wayne would hardly be one's first choice as a cultural attache, being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in harrods. but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona, and he accomplished his task with style. the duke was a guy who really could act well. his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle.<br /><br />despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to dominate this movie. many of his good intentions came a cropper. he had authority over nobody, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian.<br /><br />the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battles. i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well. there was a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props. the set pieces were complex and detailed. a lot of money and thought had been applied to it.<br /><br />the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element, and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort. script was good without being too wordy. there was a great deal of japanese dialogue, but the lengthy periods of translation didn't interfere with the narrative. it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set. whether or not they were japanese, i couldn't say. but anyway they looked the part. at least the leads were not played by cross-dressing caucasians, unlike other efforts such as 'blood alley' (yes, i know they were chinese) 'the inn of the sixth happiness' or even 'the king and i'.<br /><br />frankly, i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies. the script was better for a start. i never liked the songs in 'the king and i', and wasn't impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of 'blood alley'. i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke's more popular outings.<br /><br />recommended.
