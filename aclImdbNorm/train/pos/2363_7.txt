this adaptation of m.r. james's short story 'a view from a hill' was first shown on british television in 2005, on the little watched digital channel bbc 4. i saw that it was being repeated again on bbc 4, and decided to give it a go, remembering the bbc's successful 1970's adaptations of other m.r. james stories including 'whistle and i'll come to you my lad' and 'the signalman'. though not in the same class as these masterpieces, 'a view from a hill' is nonetheless an enjoyable and at times suspenseful drama.<br /><br />a historian arrives in a small rural village to look over the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts. whilst out in the countryside, he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. but what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named gallows hill? and what do the brusque country squire and his servant know about the situation? whilst not scary in any way, i enjoyed this little production, and had the running time been longer than 40 minutes it could have become a truly great adaptation. as it is, it all feels a little rushed and a bit more exposition to set the mood would have been welcome.<br /><br />i give it 7 out of 10.
