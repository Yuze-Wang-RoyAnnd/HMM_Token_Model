the rookie kept me smiling from beginning to end. dennis quaid played the role to perfection. the little boy that plays his son was fantastic. he made this a father-son movie to remember. the messages are good ones. follow your dreams. failing at the pursuit is alright as long as you try. the excitement is palpable. i believe this movie will be a classic.
