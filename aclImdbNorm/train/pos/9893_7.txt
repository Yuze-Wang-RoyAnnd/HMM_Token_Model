poor geeky marty (simon scuddamore) gets horribly burned due to a cruel april fool's day stunt gone very wrong. flash forward a decade and those involved (including caroline monroe, known to horror fans for her turns in maniac, faceless & the last horror film) in the prank are psyched for the upcoming 10 year high school reunion not aware that a court jester-masked killer is hiding out in the (now closed down) school and out for revenge.<br /><br />chaulk this one up to being a guilty pleasure, i knew it's a bad film. it has all the characteristics of one. yet there's just something about it that makes me feel compelled to watch it from time to time (preferably with beer in hand). i'm even willing to overlook the absolutely horrid ending (which, i do have to say, i hate) i guess i like it because it has a fun atmosphere about it and some pretty cool kills.<br /><br />eye candy (for the men): josephine scandi & donna yeager both get topless <br /><br />eye candy (for the ladies): a gratuitous cock shot of simon scuddamore at the start of the film <br /><br />my grade: b- <br /><br />lionsgate dvd extras: optional trivia track; trailer for this film; and trailers for my bloody valentine (1981), monster squad, dirty dancing
