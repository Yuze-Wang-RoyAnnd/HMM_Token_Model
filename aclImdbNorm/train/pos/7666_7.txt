two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension,one(brian thompson as a kabal)trying to destroy the earth,the other(jeffrey combs as a anton mordrid)trying to save it."doctor mordrid" is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese.the plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent,but the film is very short and entertaining.so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look.my rating:7 out of 10.
