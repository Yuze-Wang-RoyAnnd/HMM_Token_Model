this movie is a true reflection of the australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last 200 years. not pompous like the british, not gung-ho like the americans. if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did, it would have failed dismally. either due to ignorance on the british part, or too much faith in superior firepower on the american side. "true" australians (i.e. non-imports) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives. just look at examples like gallipoli; paschendale; tobruk; new guinea and vietnam.
