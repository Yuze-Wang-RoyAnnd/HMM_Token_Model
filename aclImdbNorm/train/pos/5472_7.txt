barbara stanwyck as a real tough cookie, a waitress to the working classes (and prostitute at the hands of her father) who escapes to new york city and uses her feminine wiles to get a filing job, moving on to mortgage and escrow, and later as assistant secretary to the second in command at the bank. dramatic study of a female character unafraid to be unseemly has lost none of its power over the years, with barbara acting up a storm (portraying a woman who learns to be a first-rate actress herself). parlaying a little nietzschean philosophy into her messed up life, this lady crushes out sentiment all right, but she never loses our fascination, our awe. she's a plain-spoken, hard-boiled broad, but she's not a bitch, nor is she a man-eater or woman-hater. this gal is all out for herself, and as we wait for her to eventually learn about real values in life, her journey up and down the ladder of success provides heated, sexy entertainment. john wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye make-up) does well in an early role as the assistant in the file office, though all the supporting players are quite good. *** from ****
