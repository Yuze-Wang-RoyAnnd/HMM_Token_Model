i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend. we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving. it was very well directed with strong imagery. the visual effects were amazing - especially for a short. it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father. there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard. this leans towards the gothic feel. i would love to see this as a full feature film. -- carrie
