this is an absolutely charming film, one of my favourite romantic comedies. it's extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful. though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre. he manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor, who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways, to the lovesick puppy that falls for lady x played by merle oberon effortlessly. the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting. ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well. i highly recommend it.
