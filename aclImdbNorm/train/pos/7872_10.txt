the first review i saw of page 3 said "what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say?". should he say something so decisive.<br /><br />the most beautiful thing about page 3 is it doesn't take sides. no propaganda whatsoever. this is the film that captures so many angles of an issue(i don't know what do i call as an "issue" here) and yet like any mediocre movie doesn't come up with an solution. i was so intrigued when i realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it started.<br /><br />the movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic. i wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead. so watch page 3 if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times.
