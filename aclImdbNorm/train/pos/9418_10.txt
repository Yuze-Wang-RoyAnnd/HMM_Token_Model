i've had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning (while waiting for my laundry --- how ironic!) mostly because i wanted to hear benjamin frankel's title music again. i ended up sitting through about the first half hour, entranced by how wonderfully assured the direction, writing, and performances are. the movie is like a who's who of 50s british character stars: cecil parker, michael gough, miles malleson, duncan lamont, and particularly ernest thesiger, great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills. not to mention alec guinness and joan greenwood, not character players as such but charming, charismatic leads. this is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well. an all-time classic, and i hope no one ever tries to remake it!
