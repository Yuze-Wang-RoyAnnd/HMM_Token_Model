this film evil breed: the legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort. it is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast "slasher" style death and plain disgusting acts of death. the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability, and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable. the way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different. the odd split of porn is fit in thought it really doesn't offer much, and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death. example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus, and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes. it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up. this film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture.
