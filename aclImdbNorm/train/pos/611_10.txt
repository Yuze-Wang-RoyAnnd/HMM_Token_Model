i contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered. no one i know wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and everyone who actually saw it (that i know) absolutely loved it... the advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder.<br /><br />opened at #4 behind...<br /><br />#1-rush hour, which i have not seen, average imdb score of 7.4.<br /><br />#2-the bourn ultimatum, which i have seen, awesome movie but 3rd week out, average imdb score of 8.7 (deserving i would say).<br /><br />#3-the simpsons movie, which i have seen, okay movie but 4th week out, average imdb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion).<br /><br />#4-stardust, average imdb score of 8.4 (lower then bourn, but that's been our for 3 weeks).<br /><br />whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale
