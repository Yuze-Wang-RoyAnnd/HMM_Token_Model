master cin'easte alain resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family.in this film too we see resnais' family members like pierre arditi, sabine azema, andr'e dussolier and fanny ardant dealing with serious themes like death,religion,suicide,love and their overall implications on our daily lives.the formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends, they address each other using a formal you.in 1984,while making l'amour `a mort,resnais dealt with time,memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence :is love stronger than death ? it was 16 years ago in 1968 that resnais made a somewhat similar film je t'aime je t'aime which was also about love and memories.message of this film is loud and clear :true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation.l'amour `a mort is like a game which is not at all didactic.it is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images.this is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped.
