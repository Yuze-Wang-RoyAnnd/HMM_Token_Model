i love this movie. it was one of my favorite movies. the action never stops. the whole movie was done very well. the ending is really good. ontop of it being action filled, they even have a surprised put in there for you. when i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie, but sense i am such a big luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance. i am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie. it was very original. whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me. the acting was great. luke perry did an excellent job once again. i give this movie the highest rating.
