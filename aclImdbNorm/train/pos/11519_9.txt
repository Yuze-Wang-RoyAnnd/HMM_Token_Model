the only reason that i did not give this 10 stars was the dvd format-no menus, extras, etc. however, if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life, this film is for you. if you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you. this is one of the most life-affirming films that i have ever seen. and magical. the acting is superb, the plot serves the purpose, and the opening sequence is fantastic. this is one of those films that "cult" status used to be about. i have recommended this film to all of my friends. some love it, some can't finish it. whenever i think, or feel , that something is impossible i think about alan arkin's role in this film. sure wish he'd make more films.
