this is a lovely tale of guilt-driven obsession.<br /><br />matiss, on a lonely night stroll in riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. he passes by without a word. only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. and then only too little and too late.<br /><br />the film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman. on a troll of local bars, he finds her pocketbook. he pieces more and more of her life together. his "look" changes as his obsession grows. he has to make things right. in a marvelously filmed dialog with the "bastard ex-boyfriend" he forces alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel.<br /><br />haunting long takes, a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, barking dogs. footsteps. lovely film noir with a lovely twist. a good indie ending.
