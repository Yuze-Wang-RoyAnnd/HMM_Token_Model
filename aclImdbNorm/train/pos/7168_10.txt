and i'm serious! truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching. what's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good, but if possible better than the novel it was based on. perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and trainspotting, but it is a rare occurrence indeed. but i think that the fact that louis sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses, so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further. this film has many elements that make it what it is:<br /><br />1. a unique, original story with a good mix of fun and humour, but a mature edge. 2. brilliant actors. adults and kids alike, these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard, as sometimes happen with kids movies. 3. breathtaking scenery. and it doesn't matter if it's real or cgi, the setting in itself is a masterpiece. i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view. 4. a talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius. the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book, leading up to the twists throughout the film. 5. louis sachar! the guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that i couldn't put it down. he makes sure that the script sticks to the book, with new bits added in to make it even better. 6. and speaking of the script! the one-liners in this are smart, funny and unpatronising. but there are also parts to make you smile, make you cry, and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more. 7. beautiful soundtrack. there's not a song in this film that i haven't fallen for, and that's something considering i'm supposed to be a punk-rocker. the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film. if you're going to buy the film, i recommend you buy the soundtrack too, especially for "if only", which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book.<br /><br />i do not work for the people who made holes, by the way, i'm just a fan, plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves. if you haven't seen it, do it. now. this very instant. go!
