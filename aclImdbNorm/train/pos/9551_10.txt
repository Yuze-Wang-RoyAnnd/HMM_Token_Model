i must say, i was surprised with the quality of the movie. it was far better than i expected. scenario and acting is quite good. the director made a good job as well. although some scenes look a bit clumsy, it is a decent movie overall. the idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end. the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good. the plot was clear, consistent and well thought. some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development. moral of the story, it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good.
