she's not michael jordan<br /><br />think of all the marvelous nba players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth. their names might trip as easily off the public's lips as russell, cousy, byrd, magic, mchale, oscar, wilt, the list goes on; but the volume gets turned down a little, for stockton and malone, charles, patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to michael.<br /><br />i've seen it written that gretchen mol's career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 vanity fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for ms. mol. it was later said that she had been over hyped. i disagree.<br /><br />i still remember that for some time after i saw "the devil's advocate" in '97 or '98, i would get confused as to which actress played mary ann lomax. was it mol or theron? oh yeah! charlize theron was the one in "2 days in the valley" and "mighty joe young" and gretchen mol was in "donnie brasco", "celebrity", and "rounders".<br /><br />by the time i had seen "the thirteenth floor" (mol) and "sweet november" (theron), i pretty much had them straightened out but i still put them in the same mental file drawer. both were highly talented, had sweet faces, similar body types, short blonde hair and so on.<br /><br />theron, though, was offered more work. i loved her as sara deever and as adele invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating.<br /><br />in 2003 "monster" was released and from that point until the handing of the oscar itself, all of filmdom knew who the "best actress" award was going to. and deservedly so! theron was aileen wuornos. the only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real aileen wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in selby's head. and for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive! unheard of!<br /><br />then in 2005 "the notorious bettie page" was released. mol's performance was extraordinary. maybe she was standing in the shadow of ms. theron. it was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing presidential candidate, nobody came and nobody cared. it was viewed as a continuation of an old tale, once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a "b" movie. ho hum! no, no, no! wrong! no matter what you may think of the film (and i enjoy films about the fifties) if you pass on this one you'll be missing one of the better performances of that year. ms. moll was every bit as much bettie as ms. theron was aileen. unfortunately aileen, to the film-going public, is the more sympathetic character. for whatever reason, an amoral, sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a na"ive, unsophisticated, uninhibited, religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed. bettie page was one of the icons of the fifties. her photos and films never sexual, never pornographic, but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky. there was no sense of realism, only parody. ms. moll captured the very essence of the character. she gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film, her body was bettie's. her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about bettie. cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality. in this film it's all about innocence. seeing gretchen/bettie nude didn't make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other. if you pass on this film you'll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years. by the way, shame on the mpaa for giving this an r rating.
