this is a great movie. it has a captivating story, an awesome main character, very good acting and killer action. this takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story.<br /><br />the story is very well done and there are no holes. kurt russell is a solider named todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives. eventually the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. jason scott lee being one of them. as a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like todd. they test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle russell is injured and assumed to be dead. the military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that russell is alive.<br /><br />todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on. for a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life. he rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people. when they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.<br /><br />just as russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers. what the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like todd and the other old soldiers. so while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than todd, todd easily outsmarts them. the military starts realizing this and todd kills all of their men but one. that one is jason scott lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between russell and scott lee. russell obviously comes out on top.<br /><br />this is one of the best action films i've ever seen and i've seen a lot. this has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines. the writer also didn't forget that russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women "sir". there are no holes in this film, every minute has a purpose and it's very entertaining.<br /><br />an awesome one man army action film for fans of rambo, commando and missing in action. this is highly recommended for all kurt russell fans and action/sci-fi fans.
