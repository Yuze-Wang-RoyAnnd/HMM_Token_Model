being a genre film fan, a child of the 80's and a fan of hard rock music...this movie holds a special place in my heart. it has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a guitar wailing glam- rock soundtrack. it certainly was the movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time. i didn't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here...but it's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it's cult status and eventually led to a (sadly, mediocre) dvd release in 2002. if you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea...but, trust me, there are worse films of this type out there...and, despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations, trick or treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare. you'll never look at your stereo the same way again. or should i say mp3 player?<br /><br />trick or treat trivia- marc price (eddie) played geeky skippy handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom 'family ties.' after a string of direct to video flops including, 'little devils''killer tomatoes eat france' and 'the rescue' he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand-up comedy. recently, he has been considering a tv comeback.<br /><br />glen morgan (roger) is now a major hollywood producer/ screenwriter. he has written and produced several major films and tv series, including: 'space: above and beyond''the x-files''final destination''jet li's the one''willard' and most recently 'final destination 3'.<br /><br />tony fields (sammi) started his performing career as a dancer on the tv series 'solid gold'. he appeared in several low budget films and tv shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish sammi curr in 'trick or treat'. sadly, tony passed away on february 27th 1995 of aids related cancer.<br /><br />doug savant (tim) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething matt fielding on the popular sitcom 'melrose place'. since then he has had a long and varied acting career, appearing in such films and tv series as: 'the one''godzilla''csi: crime scene investigation' and the short lived joss whedon sci-fi series 'firefly'. currently he can be seen as tom scavo on the smash hit series 'desperate housewives'.
