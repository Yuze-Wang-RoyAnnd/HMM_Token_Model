like many americans, i was first introduced to the works of hayao miyazaki when i saw "spirited away." i fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. now i am on a search to see every film by miyazaki. one of his earlier works is "castle in the sky." although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as "spirited away" (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).<br /><br />a young boy named pazu (james van der beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. when she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as sheeta (anna paquin). but sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.<br /><br />going into a film by hayao miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like miyazaki. watching a film by miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.<br /><br />because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. it also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. the voice acting is varied. james van der beek fares best. he brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of pazu that is perfect for the character. anna paquin is nearly as good as sheeta. she's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. mark hamill is unrecognizable as the evil muska. he's dangerous and wants something from sheeta, and will do anything to get it. the other voices are bad. cloris leachman is awful as dola. leachman may have won an oscar for "the last picture show," but she's annoying as the pirate leader. leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. it's so bad it nearly ruins the film! jim cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.<br /><br />i would definitely recommend seeing "castle in the sky." i'll probably end up buying it myself. but even though it's not as good as "spirited away," it's still pretty good.
