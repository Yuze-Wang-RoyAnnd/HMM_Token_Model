i liked this movie,,cute and funny.i found this film to be a good family film.the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the new york yankees. you have to be in red sox nation to understand that ny yankees is a dirty word.sorry to say that to the yankee's fans.i recommend this picture for the entire family.of course with your typical love/comedy movie,,there's a long moment in the movie,,with i'm in love and what do i do,,but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments.the movie show's some moments of how the red sox nation( in fenway park)how the fans felt about 86 years of the sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the love with another human go hand to hand.
