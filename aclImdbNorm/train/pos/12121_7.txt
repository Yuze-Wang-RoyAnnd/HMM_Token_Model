somerset maugham's characters are brought to life in rko's "of human bondage"; but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel, with bette davis' star-making performance sucking up all of the energy. otherwise, it's the story of leslie howard (as philip carey); he dreams of becoming a painter, but is told he has no talent for the arts. as the film progresses, mr. howard's struggles, instead, to become a doctor. his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts; though successful in medicine, his painting seemed easier - also, note the symbolism of his disability, a "club foot" (explained in the film).<br /><br />along the way (right away, in this version), howard becomes infatuated with waitress davis (as mildred rogers). davis' characterization of "mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech, when she tells howard, among other things, that she had to "wipe my mouth!" after kissing him. howard also performs well, but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis; so, their performances are wasted. <br /><br />still, a film to watch for the acting, including some good supporting players. bette davis' characterization was famous for inspiring a "write-in" campaign for the 1934 "best actress" academy award. for the record, she placed third. the results were: <br /><br />1. claudette colbert - "it happened one night" <br /><br />2. norma shearer - "the barretts of wimpole street" <br /><br />3. bette davis - "of human bondage" <br /><br />4. grace moore - "one night of love" <br /><br />******* of human bondage (6/28/34) john cromwell ~ leslie howard, bette davis, reginald denny
