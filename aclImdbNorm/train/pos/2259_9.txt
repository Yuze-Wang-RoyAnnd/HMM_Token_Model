i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store. it was in almost mint condition, and i'd never heard of it before. clearly nobody else had either.<br /><br />i can't believe my luck. you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message - the very moral and non-triumphalist stance of the mandela party, undoubtedly. despite its enormous length (i had to watch it in two sittings) - it was like a book one couldn't put down. perhaps the songs are not all that memorable, but the spirit of the thing glows on forever. i cannot understand comments that a musical (clearly designed for stage) is not realistic! i've seen "south pacific" and read the book too, and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book. i'll treasure this little find until it wears out. one day they'll make this again on a better budget.<br /><br />
