as someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years, i find this movie to be inspirational. if someone with such a severe case of cp as christie brown has can do so much, then there's no reason that i couldn't achieve my own dreams. daniel day-lewis and brenda fricker both give awesome performances.<br /><br />
