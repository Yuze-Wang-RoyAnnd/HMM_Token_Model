i never really watched this program before although it came highly recommended by members of my family. funnily enough, my girlfriend lives in hadfield (the filming location) and she pointed out a few landmarks when i first visited.<br /><br />this got my interest going so i bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch. besides recognising some of the locations, i found myself not in the least bit surprised. once again the bbc were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world. tlog easily ranks up there with red dwarf, fawlty towers and monty python as probably the best.<br /><br />suffice to say i am hooked on the program now. the characters are superb and show unusual depth while retaining a scarily realistic edge. the look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the north (no disrespect to hadfield which i have found a very welcoming and warm place).<br /><br />i only hope that it continues its originality throughout its run (which based upon the 2nd series which concluded its rerun in the uk last night, it certainly is).<br /><br />well done the bbc!!
