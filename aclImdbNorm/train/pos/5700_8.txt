i've read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on dvd. to be honest i really don't know what the problem with it is.<br /><br />it's a decent murder mystery thriller, shown from various points of view, from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers/suspects, including the late porn king, john holmes. please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot - i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis.<br /><br />many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but i really don't see it. many modern movies were worse - saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie, which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings (the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes, afterall).<br /><br />i was enthralled with both halves of the movie - the first showing john holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict, and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath. the movie has excellent acting, even though dylan mcdemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker-esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy personality.<br /><br />the soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of 70's b-side rock and obscure pop, spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala boogie nights.
