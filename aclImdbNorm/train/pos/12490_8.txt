allen and julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night. no one knows who killed the little girl but it's why they moved to the mountains. so the couple moves into this cabin and it's haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it.<br /><br />this movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump. some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part i didn't expect. it was a pretty good movie that wasn't the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good.<br /><br />i also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends. it is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie.
