i've waited to see this movie for a long time and at last i could manage to see it in istanbul film festival. maybe because i expected too much from this film and that's why i was slightly disappointed. i was not the best movie from korea but still it is really worth watching.<br /><br />the subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting bored though it is long. but there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another. however, the acting of jeon do-yeon is incredibly beautiful. it was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and i think this movie wouldn't be that nice if she was not in the leading role.
