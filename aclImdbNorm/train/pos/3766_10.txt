visual creative epic of inimitable style.<br /><br />this film may neither have the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic acting. but who dares to say this film is no art? i'm not a supporter of the idea, that an important film must be serious, non-commercial or bothering me with questions. even there are a lot of films, apposite to this attributes, that i like.<br /><br />bogus journey, for sure, is not one of this films. what you get is pure, excessive creativity with a very positive charged, childlike energy. this film doesn't reflect reality. its friendly-naive and utopian. imagine the world of the future described by rufus - for me it would be a pretty nice time-place combination to live in! except of that music ;- )<br /><br />technically, bogus jorney is very well made. i always liked the cinematography and the sceneries of this movie. especially in this point bogus journey tops its prequel by far. also the effects are good, and i think most of them very made without cgi. i generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies. sure its 'just another hollywood movie' out of some peoples view. but i think it is this in a very charismatic way.<br /><br />a short word to the soundtrack: all the band and orchestral music fits very well into the film. also the sound design has no lack. i am not a big fan of rock music, but i had to get this track by winger from the scene 'station' builds the bill and ted robots in the van. i love the unorthodox camera work at its beginning.<br /><br />let me conclude saying this:<br /><br />this film is very naive and very imaginative! it is way better than panzerkreuzer potemkin, the godfather, eraserhead or aguirre - the wrath of god. it is absolutely superior to citizen kane, apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil... ...it is even better than total recall... no way!? yes way!<br /><br />bill and ted's bogus journey is simply the best movie ever made.<br /><br />who dares to disagree makes himself guilty of "artsie-fartsy behavior" or likes terminator salvation (what is the bigger self-defamation)<br /><br />ps: part 1 is not the better movie. so bogus jorney is a superior sequel. not even terminator 2 is a superior sequel! its not!
