europa (zentropa) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago. this film is truly unique, and a work of genius. the camerawork and the editing are brilliant, and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film, creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience.<br /><br />the participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed. max von sydow provides his great voice as the narrator.<br /><br />a one of a kind movie! four stars (highest rating).
