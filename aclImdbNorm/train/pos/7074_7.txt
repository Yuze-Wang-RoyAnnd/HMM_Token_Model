terry gilliam traveled again to the future (he had already done it in "brazil") to tell this story about a virus that's destroying the human race.<br /><br />the script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it's quite entertaining and gilliam proves that he's got imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). as for the cast, bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just ok, but brad pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all. he should just play good-looking successful young men.<br /><br />*my rate: 7/10
