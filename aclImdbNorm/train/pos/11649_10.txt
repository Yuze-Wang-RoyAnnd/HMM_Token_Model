what an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hrs to kill, watch it, you won't regret it, it's too much fun! rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn't anything more other than him, i still liked it. the music by a.r.rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times, you really start liking it.
