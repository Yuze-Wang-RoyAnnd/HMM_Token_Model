it may be the remake of 1987 autumn's tale after eleven years, as the director mabel cheung claimed. mabel employs rock music as the medium in this movie to express her personal attitude to life, in which love, desire and the consequential frustration play significantly crucial roles. rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the profound sentiment, and yet it is not too inappropriate to utilize it as the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than an ordinary one. the director focuses on the depiction of subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life rather than mere rock music. the love between father and son, lovers, and friends is delicately and touchingly delivered through the fine performance. mabel does not attempt to beautify rock musicians as artists at all, instead, she tries to reproduce a true life on screen, making huge efforts of years' working on this project and gathering information in beijing underground pubs.<br /><br />daniel has given probably the best performance in all his movies made so far. his innate dispiritedness and reticence fit the blue mood of the film perfectly.
