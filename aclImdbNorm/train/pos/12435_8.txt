i was pleased to see that she had black hair! i've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories.<br /><br />i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer, it didn't spoil it at all. in fact i watched the film twice in one day, a sure sign that it was up to standard. this is what i do with books that i like as well.<br /><br />i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip. i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly. has he actually read the books?<br /><br />i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation.
