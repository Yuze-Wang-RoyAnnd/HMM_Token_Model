this movie was not so much promoted here in greece,even though it got good actors , great script and rather good photograph was not a so called "blockbuster" movie in my country. the movie itself is very powerful,it's about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home-village after been released from a 5yo prison time(drugs) the end is rather sad.... mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well... lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency... 7 out of 10 because very few greek movies can make such an impression!
