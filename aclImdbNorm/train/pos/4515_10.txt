that film is absolutely fantastic!! if you watch it with your friends it can be a very nice day... obviously you have to know that the film is stupid and very bad directed and acted (tomba/unziker what a couple), and that is probably the worse film in the world, but you can enjoy it very much. we watched it in 19 and it was a very nice evening. the best scenes are the first one, when the criminals kill the friend of alex, and he tries to act like a desperate, and the result is a comic scene of first category... and then when he shows to leva (antevleva, what a name) the "palassio di giusstissia", and then the accident of leva, that once is going on her car out of the road, and a second later, the car is completely empty! what a magic!
