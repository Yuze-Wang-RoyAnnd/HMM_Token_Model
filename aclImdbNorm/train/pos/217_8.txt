the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simon's play about a retired vaudevillian team, played by walter matthau and george burns, who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that. the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other. richard benjamin appears as matthau's nephew, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality. this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment...vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simon's better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau, burns, and benjamin. burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this, but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark. matthau was nominated for best actor but didn't stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoo's nest; however, in another year, this was an oscar-worthy performance. matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance. the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and can't get the name of the product right is a classic. the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns.
