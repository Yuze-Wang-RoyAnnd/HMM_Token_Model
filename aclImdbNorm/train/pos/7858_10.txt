tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford's films. at two hours, it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed. mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a "greatest hits" performance with bits of mary the innocent, mary the little devil, mary the little mother, mary the spitfire, mary the romantic heroine, etc. characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past. the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question! if the academy awards had been around in 1922, no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary's.
