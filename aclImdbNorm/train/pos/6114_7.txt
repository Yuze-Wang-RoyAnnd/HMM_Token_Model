a really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001-hit "my sassy girl" but is able to enchant most of the time. the biggest applause should go to the two leads. ha-neul kim is both sweet and quirky, sang-woo kwon is both attractive and rebellious. the chemistry between the two is very good.<br /><br />director kyeong-hyeong kim uses some cg-inserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which sang-woo kwon can shine. i liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated "volcano high". and that boy has a future - those looks, those fight techniques, and a romantic lead. not bad.<br /><br />well, i can make it short: nice film. my rating: 7/10
