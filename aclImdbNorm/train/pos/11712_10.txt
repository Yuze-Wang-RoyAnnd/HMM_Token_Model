this is such a great movie "call me anna" because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her. for patty duke to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease. i have a lot of respect for her as a person. the only thing i don't like is i can't get it on tape, i've tried looking for it but with no success. any one know how to get it?
