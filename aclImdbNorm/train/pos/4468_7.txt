two sailors are on leave--ladies man joseph brady (gene kelly) and shy innocent clarence doolittle (frank sinatra). they meet beautiful susan abbott (kathryn grayson) and both fall in love with her. there's more but you've probably guessed it.<br /><br />the story (even for a 1940s musical) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome--gets annoying pretty quick. also this movie is far too long. it's 140 minutes and that's way too much for such a silly story. there are also some boring numbers by jose iturbi and his orchestra. still this is worth catching.<br /><br />when kelly is dancing or sinatra or grayson are singing this becomes magical. none of the songs are particularly memorable but sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won't care. it's shot in rich technicolor with all the gloss mgm had. the acting is ok--kelly is fine (although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it) and sinatra is just great (although seeing him as a shy guy was pushing it too!). grayson is given nothing to do but she's incredibly beautiful to look at. some shots of her literally took my breath away! there are plenty of highlights here: sinatra and kelly's big dancing and singing number; sinatra singing anything; grayson's two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which kelly dances with jerry--an animated mouse! tom does a funny cameo too. also there's little dean stockwell who steals every scene he's in.<br /><br />so it's too long and the plot just doesn't hold up but it's still worth catching. this was a huge hit in its day.
