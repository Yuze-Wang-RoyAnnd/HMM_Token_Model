after reading some quite negative views for this movie, i was not sure whether i should fork out some money to rent it. however, it was a pleasant surprise. i haven't seen the original movie, but if its better than this, i'd be in heaven.<br /><br />tom cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable david, convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs (for only the third time in his career- the other examples were magnolia and born on the fourth of july). penelope cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role, as does diaz. the only disappointment is the slightly bland kurt russell. in the movie, however, it is not the acting that really impresses- its the filmmaking.<br /><br />cameron crowe excels in the director's role, providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick. the increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by crowe (the brief sequence where cruise walks through an empty time square is incredibly effective). the soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a crowe movie) is also sublime.<br /><br />you will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. the plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable. the movie isn't perfect, but its a welcome change of pace for cruise and crowe and for those raised on a diet of hollywood gloss, should be a revelation.
