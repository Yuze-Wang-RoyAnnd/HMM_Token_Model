sorry to say i have no idea what hollywood is doing. sure give us movies like batman begins. oh, by the way hollywood i think they may cover the story line in the movie batman, but please don't entertain us what we would really want to see batman and superman together. i really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more. i was looking around to see when it was coming out. it was like a terrible practical joke. the graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie. unfortunately it's not going to happen for now. to the producers, directors and all the actors great job but i hate you for doing this to me. you left me wanting more.
