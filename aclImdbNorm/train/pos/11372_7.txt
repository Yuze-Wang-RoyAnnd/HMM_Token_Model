"citizen x" tells the story of "the butcher of rostov", nickname for a heinous and perverse russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92. the film focuses on the novice detective (rea) who doggedly pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an uncooperative bureaucracy in self-serving and convenient denial. an hbo product for t.v., the film offers a solid cast, good performances, spares the audience much of the grisly details, but plays out like a docudrama sans the stylistics of similar hollywood fare. an even and straight-forward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little known story more interesting than "jack the ripper".
