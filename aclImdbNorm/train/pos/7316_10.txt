this film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. the claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! actors are fantastic, rip donald pleasance you were fantastic as dr loomis, he made the film even better. without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. jamie lee curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen! her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. she gives a tremendous performance. i loved this film since it scared me like hell back when i seen it in the very early 80's and i still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! the fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. we all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. death at any turn. halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. it's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. as well as psycho's superb storyline, both of which i adore, i believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. to me halloween and psycho are the best films i have ever seen and i will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
