i thought the kids in the movie were great. i deal with kids in that age group, and i thought their behaviors were very believable. i did have a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5-year old. i didn't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered my opinion of the movie. <br /><br />i think luke benward is up and coming star. i would like to see more of him on the big screen. i enjoyed his reactions to the situations that he found himself in. often kids in this age group do things without thinking through the consequences. almost all of the actors did this throughout the movie.<br /><br />i also think the message of bullying needs to be examined more in movies with this age group. it is a major problem in schools today.<br /><br />the ending was quite unexpected. billy's thoughts on whether he won or didn't win the bet were very surprising. how he handled that situation was excellent. too often today kids are not willing to compromise. the actors in this movie showed that compromise is an important part of life.
