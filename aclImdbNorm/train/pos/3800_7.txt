the world of the dragon hunters is a 3d gravity challenged world. planetoids, bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen. it is a world reminiscent of neverending story, when the nothing came to eat the world away.<br /><br />funny enough, the villain here is the world gobbler, as well. this time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes. the heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior, an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal. they are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who, to my chagrin, did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death.<br /><br />the animation is great. the voices and the sounds are top notch. too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine. they go to stop the world gobbler, they reach him almost immediately, they defeat him. the end. no real character development or story twists. not even the ones i would expect from a movie with such a plot.<br /><br />bottom line: it's a cute thing to watch, kids would probably enjoy it, but that's about it. no depth to this world (pun intended).
