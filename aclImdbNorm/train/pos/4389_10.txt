from the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast, to the intelligently written (and very quotable) script, from the lavish cinematography to the beautiful music score by carter burwell, rob roy offers a rarity in movie going experiences: one that is nigh impossible to find fault with in any area.<br /><br />there have been several comparisons made with braveheart, which came out the same year. with all due credit to mel gibson, braveheart struck me as too much of a self-conscious and preachy epic to rival rob roy as the kind of movie i would care to see more than once. while braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, rob roy just grabs you and absorbs you into its tightly edited storytelling. not a single scene is wasted.<br /><br />rob roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action and even occasional humor. the characters are well fleshed-out, perfectly conveying vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period setting.<br /><br />further, they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern film.<br /><br />for example, while we hope the heroic rob roy prevails, we realize his predicaments are products of his own pride and sense of honor. tim roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema, yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is. rob roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.<br /><br />rob roy is a delightful treasure, featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation.
