not since spongebob squarepants have i seen a greater cartoon on tv. the colors are great, the voices could't be better, the characters are so original, great great cartoon. hope nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. hope the season dvd comes out soon!!! i love cartoons like this and i hope more people tune in to se this great cartoon. it is very hard to find the season dvd, so if somebody finds a store that is selling it please let me know. the only catscratch merchandise available on nick shop is a great lookin shirt, but very very very expensive!!! if you love spongebob; and who doesn''t?; you'll love catscratch too!
