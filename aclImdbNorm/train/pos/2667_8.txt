i was never a big fan of horror movies. they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. they usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. the only horror movie i like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon. it was well-acted, and had a great story. but it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by stanley kubrick's the shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.<br /><br />the movie follows a writer (jack nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. after months of solitude and silence however, jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?<br /><br />one of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes. the hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. it is also eerily calm when jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. jack nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. my favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.<br /><br />the shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the ring and the blair witch project. it may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10
