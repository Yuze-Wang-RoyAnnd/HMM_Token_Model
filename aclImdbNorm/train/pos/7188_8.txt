along with "king of the rocket men", this was still being repeated on bbc tv in the early to mid eighties. if i was loading up a time capsule of this period both these series would definitely go in.<br /><br />someone watching it for the first time will think it is silly but this is one of the best examples of the "serials". don del oro will make you laugh (when i was little my nickname for him was mr dustbin head) and it was funny upon being shot at he says "your bullets can't harm me" then he stumbles back, seemingly less than happy. i also like the way he dispenses with sebastian in the first episode.<br /><br />i watched this again because i had good memories of it from years back, there are some good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients you expect including water,rockfalls,runaway carts... apart from the first episode(with ralph faulkner)the swordplay wasn't nearly as good as i remembered it, and yes it features the inevitable "flashback" episode! it gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace, padding and the other tricks. if you are interested in these serials i recommend the book by william witney, "in a door, into a fight, out a door, into a chase" although there is only a small entry about this series in it.
