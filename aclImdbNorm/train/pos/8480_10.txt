thanks to warner archive, i can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink. (the bathtub, however is present.) this film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to warners at the time. if some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were big in the silent days, and most faded with the popularity of the talkies. there are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well. you will be most impressed with winnie lightner, who performs two numbers. also there is that french star, irene bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy manner. perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-strip technicolor "chinese fantasy," which has been restored for this version. it is truly beautiful and it stars myrna loy and nick lucas. finally, there is the massive "lady luck" finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour. this is truly an epic of the early-talkie era. any old-movie buff will love this.
