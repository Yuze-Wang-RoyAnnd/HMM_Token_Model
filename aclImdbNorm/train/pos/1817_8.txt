all dogs go to heaven plays on the canine criminal underworld. the film is a delight for children with a comical and dark-but-satisfying and happy-ending storyline with plenty of song and dance. it features outcast charlie, a fellow canine criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead. he meets a homeless human girl who looks up to him, and through this relationship, he realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. this is a cute animation loved very much through my eyes as a child. i would highly recommend this film to children. i'm unsure about how adults would react to it. (i tried to watch it a few years ago on vhs, but those recordings don't last long, do they?)
