yes, shakespeare would indeed have been proud. laurence fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad. kenneth brannagh on the other hand was brilliant. his scheming was wonderful as was his toying with the audience. very nice work.<br /><br />there were at times too little drama where more would have been expected. cassio's slaying, for instance, was a bit clouded by too much happening to far apart, causing the spectator to twist his head to grasp it all.<br /><br />did i mention michael maloney? his madness striken roderigo was unusual; annoying even.<br /><br />if you haven't seen othello before, see this. if you haven't read othello, see this. if you haven't heard othello, see this. you do, on the other hand, do yourself a favour by reading it, seeing it acted onstage and hearing it sung too.
