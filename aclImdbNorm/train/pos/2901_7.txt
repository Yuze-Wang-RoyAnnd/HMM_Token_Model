tiempo de valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre, but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting, tremendous rapport between its leads, and outstanding photography. diego peretti stars as dr. silverstein, a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective diaz (luis luque), who's been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy. diaz has been suspended from duty, but he's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated. silverstein and diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own. peretti and luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team terence hill and bud spencer, though peretti isn't as classically handsome as hill. remarkably, even at almost two hours in length tiempo de valientes doesn't wear out its welcome, and indeed writer-director damian szifron sets up a potential sequel in the film's charming coda. all in all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence.
