this particular joe mcdoakes short subject was obviously inspired by the all star warner brothers spectacular thank your lucky stars, one of those all star wartime morale boosters of the period. in that one eddie cantor played both himself and a would be comedian who'd like to break into films except for his resemblance to cantor.<br /><br />george o'hanlon who starred in the mcdoakes shorts is both himself and mcdoakes who's just trying to get a break in film. like thank your lucky stars a few warner brothers contract players with a free moment strolled through this film.<br /><br />o'hanlon's been sent by central casting for a small one line role in a world war i film, but lookalike mcdoakes gets the message. the poor guy is so nervous about his big moment, he starts thinking of ways to deliver his one line. maybe sounding like a real movie star would help.<br /><br />86 takes later to the exasperation of director ralph sanford and the patient clyde cook who plays a british cockney soldier they do find a niche in the film business for poor mcdoakes. it's worth seeing this very funny short subject which was nominated for an oscar to find out what happens to o'hanlon/mcdoakes.<br /><br />both of them.
