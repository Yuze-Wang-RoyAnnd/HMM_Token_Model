yes, some people have said that this movie was a waste of money, but i'm the kind of die hard dragon/world-ending/holy crap action movie fan.<br /><br />but if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good. but its that kind of movie that everything just fell tougher at the right time, or just about when evil was trumph something fell in to save them at the right time. though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised me.<br /><br />the 3d graphics were pretty damn good. i mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were great!!!! big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had. the fight between good and evil at the end was, i have to to say could have been longer and slightly better, it was still pretty good.<br /><br />now on to the parts that i think could have been better. the beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles. i mean if you don't really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a dvder...<br /><br />overall i loved the movie,but the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well.
