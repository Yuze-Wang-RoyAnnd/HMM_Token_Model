i saw this kung fu movie when i was a kid, and i thought it was so cool! now i am 26 years old, and my friend has it on dvd!!!<br /><br />we got a case of brew, and watched this classic! it lost none of it's original kung fu coolness! if you are a fan of kung fu/karate movies, this is a must see... the dvd is available. i believe this movie is also called "pick your poison".<br /><br />watch it soon!
