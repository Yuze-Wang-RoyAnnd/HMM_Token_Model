this is a well directed film from john cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'the prsoner of zenda'. set in a london that only hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by somerset maughan.<br /><br />i was looking forward to seeing it on dvd as i had never seen it before and being a great admirer of bette davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. so i bought it. well she looked fine but i'm sorry to say her london cockney accent just made me laugh. bette davis was one of the greatest film actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. it was impossible to take her character seriously. it wasn't as gruesome as the dick van dyke 'mary poppins' cockney accent but close.<br /><br />in the other major role was leslie howard and he did it superbly. he was a subtle and intelligent actor the supporting actors acquit themselves well. worth watching despite ms davis' vocal gymnastics.
