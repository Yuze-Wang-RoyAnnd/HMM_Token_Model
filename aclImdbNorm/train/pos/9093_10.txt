i am the parent of a special needs child and i enjoyed the the movie very much! it was loving, warm and fun. i learned a long time ago to see the humor in things. i especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died. i attended a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited. everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions. we talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them. the screenwriter talked about how she work with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer for several years. she based the character on a real person. our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has gotten us through some very stressful times. i give the movie two thumbs up!!!
