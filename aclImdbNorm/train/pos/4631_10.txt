movies like this one, and c.r.a.z.y., make me very sad for american films with a gay subject matter. with the exception of parting glances and brokeback mountain, there are few other notable american films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie, the bubble. this movie centers on two men, noam and ashwar, an israle and palestinian respectively. their relationship is complicated by the tension between the jews and arabs in israel. couples, in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next, or who will say "i love you" first. noam and ashwar's early love is complicated by suicide bombings, armed security check points, and racism. while noam's friends accept and like ashwar, who is arab, it is clear that most of tel aviv's citizens probably don't.<br /><br />one of the most touching moments, and there are many in this film, is when noam and ashwar attend a production of "bent". we, as movie goers, see them watching this play, and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes. and ultimately, this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie.<br /><br />ohad knoller and youseff 'joe' sweid are outstanding as noam and ashwar. director eytan fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the shakespeare classic romeo and juliet. and while most movies today have sex in them, (almost as a sport), this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined. it is so refreshing. also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons. there are cartoonish characters in this movie. it just doesn't happen to be the two gay guys for a change. somewhere on this site i think i read a comparison between this movie and "friends". well, not really. yes, these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships. but i don't recall getting "blowed up" as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in "friends".<br /><br />this is a very good movie. it has heart, and heartbreak. and like all good love stories love does win out. but not in it's intact glory of full bloom . still, it's a very satisfying movie to watch.
