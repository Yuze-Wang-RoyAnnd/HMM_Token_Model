the perfect son is a story about two 30-something brothers, one who is seemingly "perfect" and the other who is basically a screw-up, frequently landing himself in drug rehab centers. after the death of their father, the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces. it isn't until the "perfect" brother makes the startling revelation that he has aids that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order, and take some responsibility.<br /><br />the movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger brother's "comeback", though it may seem a bit far-fetched at times (beating drug addiction is never so easy). what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aids, a topic that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last 5-10 years. and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding brothers is very believable and well-done. the two main actors were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic.<br /><br />a solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard farlinger whose own brother died of aids. the ending is nicely done as well.<br /><br />
