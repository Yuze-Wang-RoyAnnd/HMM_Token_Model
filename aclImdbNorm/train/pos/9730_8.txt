uk newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know toby young, the journalist on whose real-life experiences this movie is based. the key word here is "based". how to lose friends is a fictitious romcom.<br /><br />sidney young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in new york, where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally getting it right and making it. this involves him selling out, and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity. however, they are not overdone: the main substance remains a comedy which centres around sidney's misadventures. the script has its cake and eats it in that sidney is a stupid, well-meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart, moderately obnoxious skilled writer. this contradiction is never that much of an issue, because simon pegg (as sidney) projects likability too well.<br /><br />jeff bridges underplays sidney's editor a little too effectively, and kirsten dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of sidney's affections and, with regard to megan fox (who plays an airhead bimbo starlet), i can say only this: just say the word, miss fox, and i will leave my wife, sell all my belongings, and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort. of course, given that i'm a fat 56-year-old english accountant, you might not find my offer too enticing, but it's there on the table anyway. given how short her career has been so far, one might think it is a little too soon for megan fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become: however, she does it sweetly, with some skill, and extremely sexily. this girl will go far.<br /><br />there is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers - miriam margolyes and bill paterson from the uk, gillian anderson and danny huston from the us.<br /><br />there are several laugh-out-loud moments, and i smiled most of the way through. as ever, the f-word makes appearances when it really doesn't need to, although at least a couple of these are very funny.
