i could not agree more with the quote "this is one of the best films ever made." if you think vanilla sky is simply a "re-make," you could not be more wrong. there is tremendous depth in this film: visually, musically, and emotionally.<br /><br />visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (times square, post-climactic scenes).<br /><br />the music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly. without the music, the story is only half told. nancy wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme (although never released, i was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60. if you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself). crowe's other musical selections, such as the beach boys, josh rouse, spiritualized, sigur ros, the monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (crowe has an ear for great music).<br /><br />more importantly, the emotional themes in this film (i.e. love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; i admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again.<br /><br />the best part of this film however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film, you will catch something new--so watch closely, and be prepared to think! sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think.<br /><br />this is easily cameron crowe's best work, and altogether a work of brilliance. much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. it has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency of doing. it continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is (i guess to understand true art is an art itself).<br /><br />bottom line: vanilla sky is in a league of its own.
