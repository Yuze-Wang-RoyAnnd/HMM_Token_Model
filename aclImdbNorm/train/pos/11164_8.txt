in brooklyn a century ago, the rivalry between chuck connors and steve brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to brodie's famous bet that he can jump off the brooklyn bridge. this is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a bugs bunny spoof, "bowery bugs" from 1949.<br /><br />this generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some chinese tenement dwellers -- a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes, giving the film a great deal of historical interest, in my view.
