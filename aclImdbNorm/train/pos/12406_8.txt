a long-defunct prison, shut down for over 20 years, is re-opened and ethan sharpe (the late, great character actor lane smith), once a guard there, is put in place as warden. as the prisoners are put to work fixing the place up, they're instructed to break into the old execution room. this unleashes a fierce spirit that wreaks merciless havoc upon both guards and prisoners; cool-as-can-be low-key prisoner burke (viggo mortensen, showing real poise in an early role) is thrust into the role of hero.<br /><br />i know it's a no-brainer to praise the film for its atmosphere (it was shot in an actual abandoned penitentiary near rawlins, wyoming), but it elevates this horror film to a higher level. it's got a great sense of foreboding, established right at the outset. director renny harlin made his fourth directorial effort here; it got him the "nightmare on elm street 4" directing gig and effectively began an impressive career in mainstream action movies, thrillers, and horror films.<br /><br />it may have stock characters, but it's got a capable cast bringing them to life: chelsea field as the young woman vying for prison reform, lincoln kilpatrick as weary veteran convict cresus, tom everett as restless con rabbitt, ivan kane as the outgoing lasagna, tommy "tiny" lister as soft-spoken giant tiny, and arlen dean snyder as captain horton. it's also worth noting as an early acting credit for kane hodder (as the vengeful spirit) that helped *him* land the gig of playing jason voorhees in the "friday the 13th" series.<br /><br />decent special effects, moody lighting courtesy of prolific genre cinematographer mac ahlberg, spooky music by richard band and christopher stone, great visuals, the incredibly gloomy location, and an overall flashy and intense presentation help to make it quite entertaining. it's nasty, gruesome, and good fun for a horror fan.<br /><br />8/10
