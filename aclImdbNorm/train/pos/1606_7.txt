the "movie aimed at adults" is a rare thing these days, but moonstruck does it well, and is still a better than average movie, which is aging very well. although it's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it, the movie has a wonderful specificity (italians in brooklyn) that isn't used to shortchange the characters or the viewers. (i.e. mobsters never appear in acomplication. it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding) the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread. these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs. i miss these scenes. it also beautifully involves older characters. the movie takes it's own slight, quiet path to a conclusion. there isn't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax. cage and cher do very nice work.<br /><br />moonstruck invokes old-school, ethnic, workaday new york much like 'marty' except moonstruck is way less sanctimonious.
