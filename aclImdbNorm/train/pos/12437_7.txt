as a long time fan of peter o'donnell's greatest creation, i watched this film on dvd with no great hopes of enjoyment; indeed i expected to be reaching in disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes. but instead i thoroughly enjoyed this production, and i especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the modesty blaise back story. they managed to avoid the trap of making a (bad) film version of the books we are all so familiar with, choosing instead to concentrate on a period in modesty's life only alluded to in the novels.<br /><br />as for the production values (and i am no student of cinematography!): yes, the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows... but does it spoil the viewer's enjoyment? in this case i think not. instead we are introduced to one of the world's greatest literary heroines and given a taste of her capabilities.<br /><br />in regard to the casting: because we in unfamiliar territory the only people who really matter are modesty and (perhaps) professor lob. for me they were totally credible. alexandra staden, described by some as wooden, and too thin to be an action heroine, brought to the screen modesty's poise and coolness; her technique (when martial arts were needed) but most importantly personified the integrity which is at the core of the modesty blaise canon.<br /><br />ok, so we all know this film was produced to stake miramax's claim to the modesty blaise character, it was made quickly and cheaply, but... i for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers - as long as they keep to the core values and characterisations of the original stories!
