when reading a review from another user, saying that it's a terrible game, i could not stand idle and do nothing!<br /><br />well, this game is great, from the news clips (with two real persons, full of humour sense and credibility!), to the story, i find it very good! i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die, until they disappear; and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions, when riding the bike, here and there...<br /><br />except that, it's a great game, with a great story, good graphics, excellent characters, great soundtrack... i recommend it! surely! it can be a bit old, but still enjoyable! at least, on the dreamcast... but the ps2 version shall be the same.
