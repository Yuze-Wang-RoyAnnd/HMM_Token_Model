i probably saw this movie first in about 1995. since then i've returned to it many times. it's great! i especially like the first and second clips, "creation" and "civilization rising." wow! this was so cool back in the glory days of cg animation. cg is way older than i am, as i know the film "tron" was made 7 years before my time. but this film was a landmark in the early '90s. it was probably the first collaboration of different cg experiments set to music. i like it so much, i think i'll go watch it now. bye
