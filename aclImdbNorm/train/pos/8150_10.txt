my, kasi lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman. this film is a lost gem, a dead-on satire "mockumentary" of the early 90's hip hop scene, when mc hammer had just began to fade away into that good night. we follow the three members of the nwh as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would-be riches and fame. and like nickolas nickleby, at the end, they finish their journey not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and lot less naive. this is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of, but it's the kind of film you either love or hate, a lot like "company man" in this regard. i regard this movie like the 1000 islands of upstate new york: it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself.
