really, i liked it. the premise was good, the story fit where both respective series left off, and here's my favorite part. mary and valerie aren't bitter! they aren't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (a prime example is susan dey, "the partridge family"). in fact, valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie, and then mary said the same thing later, so i would be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can re-run this one.
