i'm an admirer of hal hartley's films, especially 1997's "henry fool." "fay grim" is a sequel to that film, and has a similar style and sense of humor. the plot, however, is completely different. fay grim (played brilliantly by the iconic parker posey) tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks, and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage. the supporting cast (most of the folks from the first film as well as jeff goldblum, saffron burrows, and a much-welcomed return from 90s indie-darling elina lowensohn) is excellent and the film has lots of surprises. the director claims this is part of a "star wars"-like trilogy, serving as the "empire strikes back" of the series if this is true, i can't wait to see the third installment! i just hope i don't have to wait 10 more years for it.
