arguably this is a very good "sequel", better than the first live action film 101 dalmatians. it has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all right slapstick! <br /><br />cruella devil, who has had some rather major therapy, is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them. many, including chloe simon, owner of one of the dogs that cruella once tried to kill, do not believe this. others, like kevin shepherd (owner of 2nd chance dog shelter) believe that she has changed. <br /><br />meanwhile, dipstick, with his mate, have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! little dipper, domino and oddball...<br /><br />starring eric idle as waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), glenn close as cruella herself and gerard depardieu as le pelt (another baddie, the name should give a clue), this is a good family film with excitement and lots more!! one downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick, but not quite as excessive as the last film. this is also funnier than the last film.<br /><br />enjoy "102 dalmatians"! :-)
