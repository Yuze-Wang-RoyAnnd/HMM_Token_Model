the straight story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line. he decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he can't drive and he wants to make the rip by himself. the film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way. <br /><br />richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast, most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter, and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.<br /><br />at first i felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but i soon discovered that lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie i would recommend to anyone.
