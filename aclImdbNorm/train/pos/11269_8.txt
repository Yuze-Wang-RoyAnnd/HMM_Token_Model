ever wanted to know just how much hollywood could get away with before the hayes code was officially put into effect? well, unfortunately "convention city" is lost, so well just have to watch "tarzan and his mate" to find out. for 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. just look at jane's nude swim. while tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very adult. over seventy years later, it is still as sexy as it was when it came out.<br /><br />in addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature, it is a superb and exciting adventure story. i've always enjoyed the jungle films that hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s, but there are few from the genre i'd call great films. "tarzan and his mate" is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre. the sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today. also, the animals are all too cool (espescially the apes throwing boulders). the acting won't win any major awards soon, but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture. the film is once again stolen by cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. one of the most entertaining examples of pre-code hollywood out there.
