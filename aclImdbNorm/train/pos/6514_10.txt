i thought the children in the show did a very good job. i especially enjoyed the performance of the emma character. well done! the stunts were pretty good for a low budget show. i was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes.i enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her. the ghostly apparitions of the children's souls being released was also good. another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along. there wasn't a lot of slow scenes. the adult leads were also believable and therefore helped to keep the show entertaining. all in all an enjoyable night of movie watching.
