this film deals with the irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically one man's life after he informs on a friend for the bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences. watching the film, i got the feeling that you could take the script and with just some minor updates, do it again and it, sadly, would still fit contemporary events. but te remake wouldn't be nearly as good. a magnificent performance by victor mclaglen (for which he deservedly got an oscar) and a fine ensemble cast that includes most, if not all the actors with brogues in hollywood at the time, most of them recognizable character actors either established at the time or just starting out. a very good film well worth watching. highly recommended.
