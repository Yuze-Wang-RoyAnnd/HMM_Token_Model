this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen. the writer/director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you. insomniac's nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen. is it a dream or reality? this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious. it has an eery feel with it's dark interpretations of illusions. dominic monaghan really became the insomniac. he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either! he really poured his whole being into this role. from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites. i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative, creative writer/director/cinematographer!!!
