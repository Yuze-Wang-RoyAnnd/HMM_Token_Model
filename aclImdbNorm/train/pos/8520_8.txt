i thought the movie was actually pretty good. i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. the director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell. i have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable. when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. the acting was pretty good the f/x and stunts were well done. a couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok.
