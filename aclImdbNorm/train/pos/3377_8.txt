soylent green is a classic. i have been waiting for someone to re-do it.they seem to be remaking sci-fi classics these days (i.e. war of the worlds)and i am hoping some director/producer will re-do soylent green. with todays computer animation and technology, it would have the potential to be a great picture. anti-utopian films may not be that far-fetched. the human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it. we, as humans, have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand, but there's nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves. despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc. the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish. classic malthusian economics states that any species, including humans, will multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion and growing....that's obscene.
