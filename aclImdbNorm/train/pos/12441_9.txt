this was the modesty that we didn't know! it was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the syndicates to sell to newspapers! lee and janet batchler were true modesty blaise fans who were given the dream job - tell a prequel story of modesty that the fans never saw before. in their audio-commentary, they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run smoother. the "purists" should also note that we really don't know if everything she told miklos was true because she was "stalling for time." i didn't rent or borrow the dvd like other "reviewers" did, i bought it! and i don't want a refund! i watched it three times and i didn't sleep through it! great dialog and well-drawn characters that i cared about (even bad guy miklos) just like in the novels and comic strips! i too can't wait for the next modesty (and willie) film,especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's to come!
