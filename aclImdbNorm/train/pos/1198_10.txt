like most other reviewers i have first seen this movie (on tv, never on the big screen), when i was a teenager. my dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then, and i must say he was not only right, but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since i saw it first time. i have seen it two or three more times since then (just a few days ago i gave it another watch) and it has not lost anything of its impact with time. it still a great and well worth to be seen movie! manr regard peckinpah's ride the high country as one of the first and best later western, which had a realistic look at life in the old west, but the hardly known last hunt is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier. actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time, or maybe it still is ...<br /><br />although thinking hard and having certainly seen 100s of western (i like this genre) i can not remember any western as bleak and depressive as this one. two men bound together, partly by hate, partly by not seeming to have other choices, surrounded by beautiful ms. padget, a crippled old man and a young inian, leading the life of buffalo-killers until fate reaches out for one of them.<br /><br />nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem. when the camera moves on and away from mr. taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight (on a tree)and echos from the past, when all the hatred began, are present again. mr. taylor has got his buffalo, but in the end the buffalo got him. <br /><br />aside from the top performances of everybody involved, the intelligent script and the great dialogue, it should also be mentioned, that the last hunt is superbly photograped, i have seldomely seen a western that well shot (aside from the ones directed by anthony mann, which are also all superbly photographed), that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well.<br /><br />and director brooks is really a superb storyteller. master craftsmanship!he has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre, but even in an as prolific career as this one, the last hunt still shines as one of his best, if not his best.<br /><br />definitely would deserve a higher rating, compared to the 7-something ride the high country enjoys.
