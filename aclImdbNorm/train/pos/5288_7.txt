this amusing bugs bunny cartoon sees the return of the still unnamed marvin the martian and his sidekick k-9 the green dog.<br /><br />this time instead of trying to destroy the earth marvin is on a mission to land, capture an earth creature and take it back to mars. of course the creature he picks is bugs bunny. at first bugs thinks marvin and k-9 are trick or treating but realises this can't be right when marvin drastically enlarges bug's rabbit hole with a ray-gun. bugs tries to trick his way out of the situation in a couple of ways, including persuading marvin that k-9 is planning a mutiny. eventually he is captured using an acme strait-jacket ejecting bazooka. amazingly, for an acme product, it works as advertised and bug's is forced to use his wits to get k-9 to release him, the tables are soon turned and the two disgruntled martians are trussed up and bugs is trying to fly their saucer back to earth.<br /><br />i really enjoyed this although the ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the story. marvin's voice has changed slightly here and he gets visible emotional when he is angry but this didn't make me like him or the cartoon any less.
