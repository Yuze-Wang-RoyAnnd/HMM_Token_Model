i watch this movie all the time. i've watched it with family ages 3 to 87, and everyone in between; they all loved it. it really shows the true scenes a dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. just beautiful.<br /><br />it's great for thoes who love comedy movies, the tear-jerker movies, or even just pets.<br /><br />the music is wonderful, the animals spectacular, the scenes truly thought out, and the characters perfect. what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities: shadow (the oldest, a golden retriever) he's the wise one, filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog, chance (the american bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the comical character; and sassy (the hymilayan cat) she's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner, the real girly one.
