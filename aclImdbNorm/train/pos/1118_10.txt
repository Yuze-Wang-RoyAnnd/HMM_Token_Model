well, this might be one of the funniest movies of all time, and sandy gives a tour-de-force performance! alas, her career never quite took off, but - at last - she will always be remembered for her three first-rate pictures: "the king of comedy", "dallas doll", and "without you i'm nothing". she dons into different personas from new york socialite to diana ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in america. sexy and fierce, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, she convinces the audience in every scene, and she actually is "really pretty". watch this one (if you're not from iowa), you'll certainly enjoy it!!
