this movie is so great. its set back in probably the 40's and meg ryan's character struggles to be known as 'smart.' plus tim robbins is so cute in this movie. and everything about it has a magical feeling towards it. everytime i watch it i feel happy. it's definitely a girl movie, and i'm a girl, so i like it. i also love the music. the violin is awesome. but besides that i think it's a cute story and everyone should watch it.
