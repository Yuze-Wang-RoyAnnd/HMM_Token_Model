this is the best of shelley duvall's high-quality "faerie tale theatre" series. the ugly stepsisters are broadway-quality comedy relief, and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood. jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella, especially in the garden scene with matthew broderick's prince charming. jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well, although i'm not sure i liked the "southern lady" characterization with some of the lines. steve martin's comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin, but a tiny bit misplaced in the show's flow.<br /><br />as is customary with the series, there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children (ages 15 and up). with a couple of small bumps, the show flows well, and they live happily ever after. children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it -- i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much.
