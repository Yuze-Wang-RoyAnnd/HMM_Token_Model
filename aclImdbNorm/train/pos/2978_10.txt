baseketball is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. it is an off-the-wall movie starring south park creators matt stone and trey parker.they play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation. most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to "psyche-out" other members of the opposing team. there is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things possible. one flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast, and after watching for about half an hour i found myself asking "wow this this over already?" another hilarious part of the movie was how joe and doug continuously harass squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. baseketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines, and it is very fun to watch!
