after seeing jeremy brett as sherlock holmes, no actor should ever display such conceit as to imagine that he could ever come close to mr. brett's portrayal of "one of the most interesting characters in literature". jeremy brett is sherlock holmes and in my opinion there can be no other. the great actor basil rathbone is,i must admit, a close second but, is still second. one might make the argument that mr. rathbone's screenplays were inferior to the absolutely top notch productions afforded mr. brett and to this i would agree. however when all is said and done jeremy brett will always and forever be the only actor to truly "become" sherlock holmes. the book should be closed on this subject and we,the public,left to enjoy mr.brett's unique performances.<br /><br />bill rogers <br /><br />(sonarman65@yahoo.com)
