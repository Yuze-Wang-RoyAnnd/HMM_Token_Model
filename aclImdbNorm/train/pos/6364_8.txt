"atlantis: the lost empire" was everything the previews indicated it would be. it is not often you find that. most of the time, the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible. not so with this one. i was pleased with the original plot, even though the sub-plots were not. the animation was not break through like "shrek" but it was good, none the less. the plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them. this keeps you interested. i found myself enjoying this one. "atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. you also have to think a little bit, but not too much. once you think about it a little, you can figure out what needs to happen but you really don't know for sure how it is going to happen.<br /><br />the casting was also good. michael j. fox, as milo was an excellent choice. his personality fits nicely. the gruff natured commander rourke was also well chosen with james garner. his character reminded me of his performance in "maverick" which i also liked. i really liked the casting of claudia christian as helga sinclair. her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting. it's just too bad she is a villain.<br /><br />over all, definitely worth you while (8 out of 10).
