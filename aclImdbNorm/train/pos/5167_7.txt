i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. i was really confused about who was who. for example, bill paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket. then, when all the males arrived at camp, it turned out there was a character who looked like bill paxson, but wasn't. i said where's bill paxson? then, there was a guy with his girlfriend. he said she was 21. this was supposed to be a 20-year reunion of the camp director's (alan arkin) most memorable. later on, this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences. that made no sense. she would have been one years old. that said, the movie turned out to be pretty good. kevin pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased. one guy was a complete narcissist, and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. alan arkin was interesting as an old-style camp director, who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth. the best part was that none of the grown-up campers were successes in life. none of them had very great careers. this seemed very real life. the movie was compared to the big chill. in some ways it wasn't as exciting as the big chill, but it was a lot more realistic. so, even though the beginning is not promising, the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one.
