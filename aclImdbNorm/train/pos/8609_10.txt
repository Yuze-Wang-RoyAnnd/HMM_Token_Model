i thought this was one of the best movies i've seen in a very long time. it was a great story line and showed that people are so intricate in all kinds of different ways. have recommended it to all my friends!! i always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best i've seen in a long time. i could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that natalie did to find out more about her life and loves. it showed how we not only have lives with our families ; but also have parts of our lives that we don't share with them - as it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things we don't do that we are so proud of.<br /><br />i look forward to another such movie, and will keep my eye out.
