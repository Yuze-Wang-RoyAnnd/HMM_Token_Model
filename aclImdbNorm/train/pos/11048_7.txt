i didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless. <br /><br />it is original, although reminded me a little of two other french films, vidocq and city of lost children, mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters.<br /><br />set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off, this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster.<br /><br />always interesting, with the perennial 'black arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable! <br /><br />scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing.
