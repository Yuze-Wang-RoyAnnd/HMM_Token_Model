i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because, frankly, i love the guy, even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie (long-time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick). it's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot (but then most movies these days aren't exactly original), but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband, martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter, and mitzi kapture does a good job, if that was her goal, of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like. nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. however, too much of the plot takes place off-screen -- like motivation, prior behaviors, good times and bad times -- and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience (i.e., me). the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the "but what about..." category, and overall, i can't say that i cared much about any of the characters. that being said, it was what it was -- a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon -- and i still like nick.
