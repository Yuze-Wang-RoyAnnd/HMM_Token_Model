if i had just seen the pilot of this show i would have rated it a 10. i was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world. subsequent episodes have not completely lived up to the promise, but i will keep watching and hope that it keeps getting better. the production values are incredible and the acting is first-rate. i don't mind that it doesn't seem to align perfectly with bsg because i am so intrigued by the premise and let's face it, they are two different shows. i'm thrilled that both esai morales and one of my all-time faves, eric stoltz, are back in my life (if only weekly) as i've missed them both. this is a show that requires a bit of thought from its audience and that is always a good thing. you kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show; things are not always as they seem and certainly there are shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in plot lines, characters and, of course, the various virtual worlds. we all know how it ends, but the journey is looking to be quite a ride.
