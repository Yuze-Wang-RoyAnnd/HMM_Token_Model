this is a wonderful movie about the struggle of the mormons and their final settlement in salt lake, utah. the beginning and the ending are especially powerful, and the message is one we all have to be reminded of - god doesn't talk, but he communicates, if we would only listen. as i am writing this in the midst of the horrors going on in new orleans and the surrounding area due to katrina, i was especially moved by the mormons having to leave everything behind and move on after joseph smith was assassinated. people came to this country to escape religious persecution, and yet they could not. the struggle of the mormons to cross the country, the cost in lives, the hardship they suffered was truly awe-inspiring, demonstrating their tremendous strength. as far as the actual beliefs of mormons, this is not heavily gone into, and polygamy is mentioned but is not a centerpiece of the film at all.<br /><br />the cast is top-notch, though others who have commented know more about the actual characters and can talk about how true the portrayals were. but as actors, dean jagger, mary astor, brian donlevy, john carradine, jane darwell all do excellently with the script they were given.<br /><br />though the film could have easily stood on its own (and certainly does today) tyrone power and linda darnell were added to the cast to get the crowds into the movie theaters to see a film about the mormons. power is magnificently handsome as a young mormon, and darnell, as zina, is not a mormon but stays on with the family after her father is killed. power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when he has a big scene, and darnell (still a teenager at the time of the filming) has even less, though they make a lovely couple. their fate is left unclear regarding her conversion, and one does wonder about the polygamy in their case. you can't beat either one for eye candy, however.
