five years on from the tenko survivors returning home, and from marion's double-edged "well that's that".<br /><br />it's now 1950: reunion time. the gang's all here: marion, bea, ulrica, kate, dorothy, christina, dominica, and latecomers maggie and alice. the story that unfolds is a beaut: as perfectly written and acted, and as thought-provoking and moving, as the original series.<br /><br />all the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here. from marion's family to joss's health centre, everything has changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the best.<br /><br />a trip to dominica's plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge-of-the-seat tension. there's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as, once again, fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives. dominica finally shows her true colours, and there are some shout-at-the-telly moments of drama.<br /><br />lush location filming in singapore, and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. it's such a shame that this really is the end. i could watch it all over again. perfection.
