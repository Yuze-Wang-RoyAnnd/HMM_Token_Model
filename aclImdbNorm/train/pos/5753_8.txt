***1/2 out of ***** while i am not concerned with the fact that this is an english dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted, as it seems to reside in many quebecois native hearts. however, this was a movie as a child that i was a fervent admirer of; keeping in mind now that it was made for children, i rate it on a relative basis. the story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort, and jostling back-'n-forth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions, as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons. if i had children, this definitely is a film i would try and get them interested in, as the snow fort wowed me when i was young, and i think even children today would agree, albeit with pixar and all the computer animation, maybe i am out of date and just don't realize it. in addition, the movie's message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that, for children (and adults alike).
