gena rowlands plays an actress who loses her grip on reality when she witnesses the death of a fan of hers. she becomes increasingly deluded from reality, and as a result her emotional turmoil intrudes with her work as an actress. in the sense that she breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything, yet still manages to engage her audience makes the film interesting (if a bit self-important) as a parallel of cassavettes' own struggles as a filmmaker. there's so many ideas thrown around, and as result it becomes a bit muddled (i'm still pondering the relation between the dead fan and rowlands, among many other things), but the way they're presented in their rawest form makes it a consistently interesting and thought-provoking film. would be great on a double bill with mulholland drive.<br /><br />
