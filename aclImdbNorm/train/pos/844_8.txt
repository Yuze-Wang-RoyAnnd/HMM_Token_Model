a chance encounter between a salesman and a hit-man changes both their lives. this is an odd film that works, an impressive effort for writer-director shepard. in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond, brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit-man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job, but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope. kinnear is equally good as the salesman, a decent fellow with a void in his life. davis is fine as kinnear's flirtatious wife. mainly a character study, the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
