this is a pretty well known one so i won't get too deep into it. the basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor. human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid. it also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger. nobody believes the teens (steeve mcqueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do it seems that the blob can't be stopped. it's really well done for it's age and unlike a lot of other 50's flicks the pace is pretty fast. the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies. if you can dig the gooey gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from '88 as well.
