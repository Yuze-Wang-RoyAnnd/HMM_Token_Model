hey now, i can't claim to have seen all of the films of jesse (jesus) franco, and there sure seem to be a lot of them, but this is one of the better (and weirder) of the lot that i have seen. i'd say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties/early seventies and anything lately has been a bit too strange for me, and it takes a lot for me to declare that. anyway, this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points. this woman is an actress or something, performs in some theater in berlin where acts of "fake" torture are performed for an appreciative audience (?!) and she seems to have this problem with dreaming. the catch to what's real and what's not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isn't. she seems to exist in a state of deja vu. i won't say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining. shots of berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place, so that adds to the atmosphere. the ending is extremely abrupt though, the film just ends and the tape went black, i guess no need to let you know it was over at that point. my copy was from the anchor bay euro-trash collection, and i say, give me more euro-trash, i can't get enough of that crap. but it's good crap.
