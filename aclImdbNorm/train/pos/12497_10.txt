if you haven't already seen this movie of mary-kate and ashley's, then all i can say is: "what are you waiting for!?". this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much! it's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breath-taking (scenery-wise)! of course; as always, mary-kate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway! would any true fan want it any other way? of course not! anyway; it's a great movie in every sense of the word, so if you haven't already seen it then you just have to now! i mean right now too! so what are you waiting for? i promise that you won't be disappointed! sincerely, rick morris
