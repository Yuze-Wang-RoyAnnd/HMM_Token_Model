this movie is finally out on dvd in italy (completely restored). i have seen this movie so many times and i find it even actual these days (2003) when italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship (or the us for that matter). i am glad there are outcasts as the one played by mastroianni in this movie who can sing out of tune; maybe they can teach the sophia lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognised as human beings.<br /><br />back to the movie: as most people here already mentioned the acting is wonderful but the audio background is astonishing. i must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you don't understand the italian language but i can assure you that the show-off of machism, the distortion of reality in that ever-present radio-chronicle of the hitler visit to rome can really make you shiver!<br /><br />a masterpiece!<br /><br />
