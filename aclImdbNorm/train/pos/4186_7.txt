i watched this flick yesterday and i have to say it's the finest horror film made for $36,000 i've ever seen (sorry steckler) the film is definitely worth seeking out if you are a zombie fan. this movie reeks of soul and atmosphere. some of the shots of the zombs are the best ever committed to film. very creepy looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble to their screaming victims. brrrrrrr.<br /><br />hot saggy canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before the horror rears its undead corpse eating head. this film entertained from start to finish. i couldn't ask for more than that. my only complaint is that is was too short.
