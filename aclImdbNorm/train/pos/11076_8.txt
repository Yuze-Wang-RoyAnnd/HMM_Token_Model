i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone! the fact is it wasn't what anyone was expecting, especially from guy ritchie. what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners "do ya like dags?" etc, but this is far more mature than his previous works. i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder, this film demands all your attention! look past the cool and dazzling look of the film, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film.<br /><br />yes this has its influences from modern classics( fight club, pulp fiction etc ) but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none. i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney "masterpieces".
