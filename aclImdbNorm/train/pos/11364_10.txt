rea, sutherland, demunn, and von sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performances. sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role, where he must portray a character whose morality is, at first, uncertain to the audience. as is so often the case with sutherland's characters, we must ask "is he a villian [in this case, a minor one], or a hero?"<br /><br />this is a disturbing story, intelligently told, about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the old soviet union that impeded the efforts of extremely competent people. as sutherland's character wryly notes, "the measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions". the "committee meeting" (between rea and sutherland's characters) after perestroika is enforced, with its revelations, has enormous emotional impact. you can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system.<br /><br />the handful of dramatic scenes portraying victims' family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story. this is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter, but effectively reminds us that the victims had lives, and were loved.<br /><br />this is a sad, but very important film, which deserved its showcase on canada's history television.
