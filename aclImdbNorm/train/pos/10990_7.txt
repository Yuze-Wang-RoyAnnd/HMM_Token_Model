cypher is a clever, effective and eerie film that delivers. its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands. although one could immediately label the film a science fiction, there is a little more to it. it has it's obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir/detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story.<br /><br />the film, overall, plays out like it's some kind of nightmare; thus building and retaining a good atmosphere. we're never sure of what exactly is going on, we're never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we're not entirely sure of certain people, similar to having a dream
