i remember seeing this one when i was seven or eight. i must have found the characters round, because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie. and the ending, now that's sad, well... for a 7-8 year old kid.<br /><br />i had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately, and found that the plot was too simple, the character, two-dimensional... i guess it's the kind of movie that you can only with the innocence of a young child... pity...<br /><br />i recommend this one for all you parents with small kids... ( i saw it in its original french version, so i cannot tell you whether the translation is good or not.)
