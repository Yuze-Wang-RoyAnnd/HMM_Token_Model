my family and i have viewed this movie often over the years. it is clean, wholesome, heartbreaking and heartwarming. showing us the compassion between two families of two countries thousands of miles apart and by the most uncanny of coincidences, it's almost as if the hand of god had to be intervening.<br /><br />5 yo jodelle micah ferland who plays desi the heart stricken little girl, does a magnificent job of acting her part, and for me she was the priam choice for the lead role.<br /><br />all in all, a 10 out of 10. there are no downsides to this sweet human story. children of all ages will tearfully, then joyfully watch this and it will bring the viewing family together with smiles and good feelings.
