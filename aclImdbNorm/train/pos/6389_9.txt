passing stones definitely one of the best comedy independent films ever. you must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one. this film for some reason hasn't received its credit due. first, lets start with the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt. when a dead father leaves letters behind advising of a hidden treasure it not only brings two families together but starts a whirlwind adventure. mix in a polish translator, a comatose mother, a crack-head with turrets syndrome, a twisted homosexual hypnotist, and one drag queen, money not only makes the world go round but can turn family into enemies. my favorite character in this film would have to be the sister/crack addict with turret's syndrome,her sudden out burst will have you crying and mimicking for weeks.
