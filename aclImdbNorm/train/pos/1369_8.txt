i loved this movie, and i am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it, or so it seems. no, this movie is not deep -- who cares? these kinds of movies never are. but strangely, there is a message in it. it's that we each have the potential to be whatever we want to be.<br /><br />parker posey is great in this movie. i've always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to katharine hepburn. so, it's great to see that both hepburn and posey made movies about librarians (hepburn's is the desk set). all librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see party girl.<br /><br />i gave this movie an 8. it is not by any means a great film by cinematic standards, although there are some nice shots in it. but it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
