it's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. bend it like beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick. the story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy, the jokes were laugh out loud funny, and the characters are well acted. parminder nagra and keira knightley are brilliant as teenagers jess and jules, putting in great performances both on and off the pitch. anupam kher is wonderful as jess' worried father, and jonathan rhys-meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'ride with the devil,' comes across so well as the nice guy for once, making full use of his gorgeous irish accent! even if you don't like football, go see this film. if anything it'll make you smile.
