yes i'll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated.<br /><br />sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass. he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind.<br /><br />the acting was good (apart from thewlis)<br /><br />stone really has a talent with this role. she's slick, naughty and seductive and doesn't look a day older than she did in the first.she really impressed me(like in casino). morrisey was also good. he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. thewlis however was lame. he ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. he really sucked.<br /><br />overall, this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch. just ignore thewlis.
