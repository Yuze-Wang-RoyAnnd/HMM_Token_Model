in our household, we are enormous fans of a christmas carol and watch virtually every version each christmas, including the old 1938 reginald owen and the modern 1999 patrick stewart. our overall favorite is the 1951 black & white classic, because alastair sim is ebeneezer scrooge and his conversion rings the truest. however, this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely & entertaining story, quite faithful generally to dickens' novel. (see my comments on the other film adaptations, if interested)<br /><br />first of all, george c. scott can certainly seem pretty crotchety and doesn't make a bad scrooge. i adore his sideburns, his long topcoat & hat. he cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot, and quite a handsome gentleman. however, sometimes it seems scott is enjoying his role as scrooge just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he ought!<br /><br />this rendition has the best overall christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending. filmed in the town of shrewsbury, england, it just seems somehow very british. the film has a lovely musical score, with wonderful, lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale. sometimes i could almost smell the chestnuts roasting and the pudding singing in the copper! <br /><br />marley's anguished ghost (with his wonderful jaw dropping scene) and the three spirits are all quite convincing. christmas past is a lovely ethereal lady, christmas present wonderfully giant and jovial, christmas yet to come shrouded and foreboding as always. however, i found scrooge's nephew, fred, a wee bit quiet & grim, not nearly as jolly & hearty as he should be. i like the nephew's wife, whom they've named janet, with her lovely, sprightly period hairstyle. instead of blind man's bluff, they've concocted a game called similes for the nephew's christmas dinner party, which is a cute little touch, scrooge getting right into the spirit of the thing.<br /><br />the cratchits and their somewhat meagre (though much appreciated) christmas dinner are well depicted, with bob (david warner) suitably sympathetic and long-suffering in his miles of scarf. mrs. cratchit is charmingly portrayed by susannah york, who also starred with george c. scott in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of jane eyre. above all, this version has unquestionably the best tiny tim, not only an adorable & endearing little waif but sickly. with those dark circles under his eyes, the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hour!<br /><br />this is a delightful & heartwarming version of the holiday classic. with its festive atmosphere, it's sure to put you in the spirit of the season.
