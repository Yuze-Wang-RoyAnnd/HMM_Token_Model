peter ustinov plays an embezzler who is just getting out of prison when the film begins. as soon as he walks out the gates, he immediately begins working on a scheme to once again make a bundle by stealing, though this time he has his sights set pretty high. this is actually one of the weak points about the film, as he apparently knows nothing about computers (few did back in 1968) but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight! yeah, right. anyway, he comes up with a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and obtain a job with a large american corporation so he can eventually embezzle a ton of cash. considering his knowledge of computers is rudimentary, it's amazing how he puts into effect a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses. but, it's a movie after all, so i was able to suspend disbelief. by the end of the film, he and his new wife (maggie smith) are able to run away with a million pounds.<br /><br />at the very end, though, it gets very, very confusing and smith announces she's managed to actually accumulate more than two million by shrewd investing in the companies that ustinov started (though she didn't realize they were all dummy companies). this should mean that eventually these stocks she bought were worthless. what they seem to imply (and i could be guessing wrong here) is that ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed in the stocks before this became known and the stocks would thereby then become worthless. either way, the film seems to post on a magical ending whereby no one is hurt and everyone is happy--and this just didn't make much sense. it's a shame, really, as the acting and most of the writing was great. karl malden, bob newhart, peter ustinov and maggie smith were just wonderful.<br /><br />if i seem to have interpreted the end, let me know, as the film seemed very vague in details at the end.
