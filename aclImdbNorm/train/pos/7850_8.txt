an absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage, russian animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz's "mest kinematograficheskogo operatora" ("the cameraman's revenge", or "the revenge of a kinematograph cameraman") is a delight of early animation, brimming with highly-effective stop-motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination.<br /><br />mr. and mrs. beetle have a completely uneventful marriage, and both yearn for more excitement in their lives. mr. beetle's desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the "gay dragonfly" night club, whom he visits whenever he takes a "business trip" to the city. she is the only one who understands him. a fellow admirer of this dancer, an aggressive grasshopper, is jealous that mr. beetle has stolen his lady and, as fate would have it, he is also a movie cameraman. the devious grasshopper follows mr. beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room, where he films their exploits through the keyhole.<br /><br />meanwhile, mrs. beetle has, likewise, acquired a friend to add excitement to her life. he is an artist, and he brings her a painting for a present, before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy. at that moment, however, mr. beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle. as mr. beetle bashes through the front door, the artist friend clambers up the chimney, but he doesn't escape without mr. beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him.<br /><br />there is a certain irony in the statement that follows: "mr. beetle is generous. he forgives his wife and takes her to a movie." he is generous enough to forgive her, and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier. at this point in time, however, we still haven't forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge, and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film mr. and mrs. beetle are attending. suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of mr. beetle's disloyalty, and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella, before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper.<br /><br />in the final scene, both mr. and mrs. beetle, now somewhat more appreciative of each other, are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when mr. beetle sought his final revenge. we do, indeed, hope that "the home life of the beetles will be less exciting in the future
