i almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways.i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked. the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station.they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy. it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary.the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be. the make-up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one. it was a simple story with believable acting.it's not the scariest or goriest movie, but i wasn't ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it. on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i'm gonna check them out.
