having read diamond's book, i was slightly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative. reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'western civilization' under every rug.<br /><br />is diamond a little preachy ? sure. like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. he uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. we get it, after about the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />is diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ? sure. the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes. but the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the spaniard's success against the established cultures.<br /><br />is he preaching *against* western civilization in any way ? nope. not a word. not to my ear. all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason.<br /><br />in the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.
