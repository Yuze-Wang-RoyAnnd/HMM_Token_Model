this film was an interesting take by hollywood on the novel by of the same name by pearl s. buck. while some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. i found that the white actors playing chinese was not as bad as i expected, that it wasn't the asian equivalent of blackface. back then there were not really any asian actors in america (not even george takei was acting) and rainer did a good job with her part. it wasn't the greatest performance i have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. the locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects.<br /><br />i wonder that the timing of the release during the great depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.<br /><br />the film had some parallels to the john ford style, but i think the eastern influence affected it as well. if this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. however here he learns his lesson, then wins.
