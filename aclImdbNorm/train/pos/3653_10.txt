why a good actress like elizabeth berkley stars in this commonplace movie???!!! the cast gives some good performance (elizabeth berkley as a barbie girl, ele keats as a girl without mother and justin whalin, a guy eternally lessened by his bother), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original. i can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen! julie corman (the producer): are you crazy???!!!
