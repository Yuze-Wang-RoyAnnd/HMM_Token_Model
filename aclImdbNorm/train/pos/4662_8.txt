i just saw hot millions on tcm and i had completely forgotten this gem. ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that has him cleverly going from two bit con man to ingenious... well you'll see. maggie smith is perfect as the bumbling secretary/neighbor who has a tough time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that beams through in this picture. she creates a fine portrayal of a warm, witty and real person who in the long run...well...<br /><br />molden and newhart as top executives take on the challenge of making what could be banal roles and make them come out into a comic life of their own. <br /><br />robert morley and ceasar romero are just a pleasure to see and i know at least in romero's case ustinov is extending a helping hand of work. <br /><br />this film is meant to be a shot back at the rising computer age and it's problems for the average con man or man for that matter but in fact the characters are so involving and so much fun to watch that the computer sub plot is almost lost...i say almost.<br /><br />let down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and friendly, forgiving and deeply involving plot in this picture.
