the life and time of little richard, as told by little richard, as produced and directed by little richard, was about as one sided as one of his songs. this is not a biography or even a docudrama, but does have good writing, great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing richard. all the music is by little richard, so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song.<br /><br />the movie covers his early childhood, carrys thru the formative years in music, the wild success and richard's throwing it all away to praise the lord. its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that little richard discovered the beatles, whom opened for him.<br /><br />my main objection is that his outrageous, counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time. some of his energy, which he still has, does not come across full force. he seemed tame, compared to what i remember of him at the time.<br /><br />the best scenes are richard getting jilted by lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing, to make the point about not having a decent place to change.<br /><br />if they had gotten into the "bronze liberace" as richard use to refer to himself in interviews, then there's a story. trust me i just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys, giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience, his headband. nearly 68 and still going strong i recommend this movie and any concert or t.v. appearance you can find. little richard is always on
