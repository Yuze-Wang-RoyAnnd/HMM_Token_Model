i'm a belgian and grew up in the sixties. most of the us series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and batman was one of the first i was keen on. unfortunately over here it caused a "panic hysteria" amongst the mothers because batman was considered as too violent. geez, compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays. so because of my the over-protective mothers from the 60s i only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes ! i got so frustrated i started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them !) to compensate. i even got the view master slides... i had an urge to see the caped crusader. all kids need some kind of hero.<br /><br />years later i finally got the chance to see the re-runs as an adolescent and i enjoyed it tremendously. the tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped me when i would've watched it as a kid, but i understood it at the age of 17. yeah, i've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on dvd (to my knowledge)<br /><br />this evening i enjoyed "return to the bat cave"... it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes. to see adam and burt was a delight and this tv movie is simply fantastic in every aspect. they play themselves as they played their parts in the series.<br /><br />congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic "feast"... i'm gonna watch it again. my advice to all batman fans is: see it !!! rent it !!! lend it from a friend !!! buy it !!! i'd never expect myself to rate this as 9/10... very well done !
