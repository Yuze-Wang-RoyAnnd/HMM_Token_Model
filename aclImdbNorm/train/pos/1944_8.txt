this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. it should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time.<br /><br />the swimming instructor is an almost-olympian, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of horndogging from his female students. he attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results.<br /><br />the students characters are mainstream u.s.a; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason. the movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. several subplots provide amusing fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys.<br /><br />this is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality.
