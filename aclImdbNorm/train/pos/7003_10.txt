the emotional impact of this movie defies words. it is elegant, subtle, beautiful, and tragic all rolled into two hours. this is will smith as he matures into his acting ability, the full range of it. who knew? i saw the pursuit of happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, smith. his performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, i'm not sure, but i view him differently now. seven pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief. don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. it is a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice.
