i will admit, i thought this movie wasn't going to be any good but i soon changed my mind. the movie was keep you guessing as which direction it's going. pierce broson is amazing in his role as a hit man, who suddenly becomes burned out & asks a man he met at a mexican bar for help. greg kinnear is an awesome straight man, as his role as a mild mannered man from denver, who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar. the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners (mostly about sex).<br /><br />the imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially at the bullfight scene & when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs.
