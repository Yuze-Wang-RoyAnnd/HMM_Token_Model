one of the most interesting movies to be classified as "blaxploitation," bakshi's "coonskin" is a rich text full of wonderful insight. he wrote it in collaboration with scat man crothers and barry white, who appear in the film as well. the racist imagery can often be disturbing, but the message of the movie was so powerful that the naacp gave it an endorsement (but only grudgingly).<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that bakshi attempts to deconstruct. wonderful stuff.
