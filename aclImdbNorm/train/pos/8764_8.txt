alice(claire danes) and darlene(kate beckinsale) have been best friends since forever and after they graduate they decide to take a trip to thailand. due to a incident, they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him hong kong for the weekend. but at the airport, alice and darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroine and they are sent to prison. now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship. this was a pretty good movie, i've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you entertained. claire danes did a great job as usual, she is a great actress. i would give brokedown palace 8/10
