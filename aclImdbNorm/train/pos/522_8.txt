a wonderful film by powell and pressburger, whose work i now want to explore more. the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another. beautifully shot and acted, although david niven doesn't seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be. fun to see a very young richard attenborough. this film made me think, while i was watching it, and afterwards.
