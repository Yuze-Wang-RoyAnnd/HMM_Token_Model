as someone who's never been into sports, it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football (or as we americans inexplicably call it, soccer)-themed "bend it like beckham". but i gotta say, this was one cool movie! anglo-indian jesminder bhamra (parminder nagra) and her wasp friend juliette paxton (keira knightley) love to play football (yes, i'm going to say it the british - and international - way) and just adore football player david beckham. but jesminder's traditional sikh parents don't approve (her mother offers a really whacked-out description of football early in the movie). okay, so maybe it was sort of a clich'e in that sense, but you gotta love this movie! and if like me, you go to this movie not knowing the definition of "bend" in football...don't worry, the movie explains it (i'd also never heard of david beckham prior to this movie). and we all know that keira knightley hit it big: a few months after "bilb" came out in the states, she starred in the equally cool "pirates of the caribbean: the curse of the black pearl".
