i took a chance on "hardcastle and mccormick" by purchasing the first season's worth (canadian release) from amazon. when i got it, i started with the pilot, and i was instantly hooked after that. i rated it 5 stars on amazon, and i am rating it 10 stars here. it is just that good. what i liked about it were the opening and closing themes, and of course stephen j. cannell's logo at the end of each episode, but most of all, the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack each case. i was so hooked that i also purchased the second season as a companion, and i enjoyed it equally. if you do not have this excellent series on disc, i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection.
