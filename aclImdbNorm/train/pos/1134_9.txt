the only part lacking in this movie is shue's part as the daughter wanting to follow in her "aunt's" footsteps as a daytime soap star. otherwise it would be a perfect 10.<br /><br />it seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script - i have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wasn't taking place in parts. it was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you.<br /><br />it's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once. i'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose.<br /><br />you'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely, 'nurse nan' has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with you.<br /><br />if you love daytime soaps or despise them, this move pokes fun in all the right places.
