i may have seen an episode or 2 when the show originally aired but when i watched 1 episode on netflix i was also hooked. i watched the whole series in like 2 days. :) i really liked gary cole's character. first he's thoroughly reprehensible then you start liking the character ("these things have a thousand uses")! his folksy andy griffith meets charles manson meets satan is great. charming, charismatic, smarmy, and uh kind of dangerous and by "kind of" i mean "really". i wanna be like him when i grow up. lucas black is great too. the accents are great too. anyway, i thought this was one of the best tv shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it.
