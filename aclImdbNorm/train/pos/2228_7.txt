the main problem i see with this film is its score, which screams with every note, "this is a cheap-ass movie." there's not much more to say here. the score just plain sucked.<br /><br />the second problem, which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between martha (adrienne barbeau) and the sunflower man (richard ziman), in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. at all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. in other words, suspension of disbelief breaks down here. the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience.<br /><br />the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau. while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. the main point of her performance that didn't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambo-like woman on a mission. this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon barbeau. to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part, however, i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole.<br /><br />finally, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor, most notably during its horror flashes. i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie.<br /><br />so what's my holistic grading of this piece? i'd give it a solid c+ to b-, depending upon how much credit you're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism. i see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit fizzly in the second half; and nicholas brendan, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance.<br /><br />all in all, this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a nazi you love. :)
