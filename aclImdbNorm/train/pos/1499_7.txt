for fans of 1970s hammer type horror films, this movie should be a treat. the only thing i didn't like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode. in general, however, this is a solid, spooky little movie. if this is not amicus' best film, it's certainly one of them. the best episode, rightfully saved for last, is the one featuring jon pertwee as a horror film actor--it is really excellent. as good as pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe he didn't do more of these types of movies. all in all, this is an entertaining movie, which scared the heck out of me as a child, and which still gives me the creeps to this day.
