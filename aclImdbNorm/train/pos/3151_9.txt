i saw this show about 3-4 years ago. it was dam funny! when i first time i saw it was playing on etv(estonian television) and i started to like it. too bad that that show is on bad time for me. hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing frank sinatra! and he comes on stupid ideas. he got these glasses which h are brown. i like it . and there's fez. the group pervert. we all know what he does when his alone..... he wants to get laid badly. he even had it with his boss in one episode.his from india. and there is michael , the stupidest guy on whole group , probably stupidest in town and his a cop! he is so stupid that i remember follows: hyde says: did u called cops ? - no michael comes in and says. does anyone know how to turn off siren? he is a town playboy. then comes jackie , who is former girlfriend of michael and then she's hyde's girlfriend. then is eric who's son of grumpy war veteran and son of kitty the housewife. his one big pussy. but he loves donna , his girlfriend with who they plan for they're marriage. donna is one hot girl. hmm what i forget? ah hyde lives in a basement .
