handsome and dashing british airline pilot george taylor (a solid portrayal by guiseppe pambieri) gets beat up by thugs after a wild night in hong kong. george meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal dr. emy wong (a fine and charming performance by the lovely chai lee). george regains his health and goes back to work. when emy fails to hear from george for a lengthy amount of time, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. while director/co-writer bitto albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft-core sex, this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze. instead it's a surprisingly thoughtful, touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters (chai as emy wong is especially radiant and endearing). the picture starts out bubbly and cheerful, but the tone radically shifts into a more grim and harsh mood about two thirds of the way through. emy's descent into vice after she falsely assumes that george has abandoned her is bleak and upsetting; ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending. granted, the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too silly or trashy. moreover, the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic. notorious italian porn star ilona staller has a nice sizable supporting part as george's jealous and uninhibited secretary helen miller. guido mancori's polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations. nico fidenco's funky, throbbing score hits the groovy spot. worth a look for those seeking something different.
