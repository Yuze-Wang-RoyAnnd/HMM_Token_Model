an unconventional historical drama, with some fine battle scenes. tobey maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good back-up. the script is literate and pretty original, and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes. that said, it does drag a bit, and the last reel is too much like a tv mini-series. still, frederick elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch). worth seeing.
