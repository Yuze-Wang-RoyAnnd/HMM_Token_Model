first off; i'm a dedicated fan of modesty's, and have been reading the comics since i was a child, and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying, but where they fail, this one rocks! <br /><br />well then, here we go: ms blaise is working for a casino, a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives. if the robber wins one round, she'll have to tell him about herself. if she wins two times in a row, one of the staff members goes free. (sounds stupid, yeah, well, i'm not that good at explaining either..) ;)<br /><br />she tells him about growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape, living by nature's own rules. they hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight. as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war, and as they are taken for rebellions, they are being shot at and the old man dies, which leaves her to meet the city by herself.<br /><br />then she meets the man who's casino she's now working for, and there the story ends. <br /><br />what is to follow is that there's an awesome fight and the line's are totally cool. alexandra staden is a terrific modesty blaise! just as modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as the comic-one.<br /><br />feels awkward though, too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent, but that's not relevant since the comic book- blaise can't speak out loud, but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent. (not to mention that it's weird everybody's speaking english in the balkan..)<br /><br />the acting is really good, even the child who personifies the young blaise must have a applaud! <br /><br />my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robber's ass! totally awesome! :d i can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie/s!<br /><br />watch it, you won't be disappointed!
