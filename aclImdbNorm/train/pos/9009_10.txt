this movie truly captures the feeling of freedom.......and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth....in the most delightful, light-hearted way. not a serious, but hilarious adventure.<br /><br />the story mirrors life. we don't always get what we want right away but we find out we get what we need to to understand why we didn't get what we wanted....which results in us getting more than we thought we would get! you will get this once you see the movie. <br /><br />and this movie is truly about finding love and knowing one has found it and that it totally changed one's life.<br /><br />it is one of my all time favorites......not easy to find but worth the hunt.........i guarantee you will watch it more than once!
