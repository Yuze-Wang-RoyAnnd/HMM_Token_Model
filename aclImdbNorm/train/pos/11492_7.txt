the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia (brooke adames) & bradley marshall (jeff hayenga) who have tried for the last five years to conceive, virginia has had two miscarriages since then & is desperate to have a child. they visit dr. richard meyerling (james karen) for help after he is recommended by some of their friends, dr. meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child. dr. meyerling operates on virginia & it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success & virginia is pregnant. at first everything seems perfect & the marshall's couldn't be happier, but their picture perfect lives don't last for long as virginia's pregnancy develops problems, she becomes moody & acts totally out of character & she receives a worrying phone call from beth (jane cameron), another woman who has undergone dr. meyerling's procedure, who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends & is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher. virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her...<br /><br />produced & directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror/thriller (it's definitely not a sci-fi film as the imdb would have you believe) that pleasantly surprised me. the script by henry dominic tries to be different & it must take some credit for that at least. the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares & bad special effects, it's got quite a clever story that works & plays on basic human fears. it moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means. the climax was good & seemed a fitting way to round things off & the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then, maybe flender knew something the rest of us didn't. on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements & is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times. also, i have to mention it, what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh?!<br /><br />director flender does an ok job, the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it's good enough. the atmosphere is good & there's a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her & dr. meyerling's sinister plans aren't fully revealed until the last possible moment. disappointingly the blood & gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens, the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i'll remember too much about it.<br /><br />technically the film is ok, i'd imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it's well made even if it's a little bland & forgettable. the baby creature is actually a decent special effect & has fairly realistic facial movement. the acting is good & this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends (1994 - 2004) star lisa kudrow, i have to be honest i don't like friends & i don't even know who she was in this so i can't tell you how she did.<br /><br />the unborn is a good horror/thriller that deserves to be more widely known & seen, it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves. if your a horror fan & are looking for something a bit different, something slightly more intelligent & thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn. followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii (1994) which i watched straight after this, check my review out if you want..
