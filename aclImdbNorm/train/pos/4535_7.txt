the first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring. it focused on the personal problems doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. even though these subjects had an important impact on doyle's life, i was more curious about the birth of sherlock holmes. the last 40 minutes were excellent. we finally got a look inside doyle head, how he created holmes and why he had to 'kill' holmes. the actors are excellent. including the intriguing selden played by tim mcinnerny, arthur conan doyle, a compelling role played by douglas henshall and brian cox as the 'role model' for sherlock holmes, dr. bell. the locations are good, especially for a tv movie and the camera work is nice. if the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece.
