cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor. it's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars. it has great action sequence's, edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies.
