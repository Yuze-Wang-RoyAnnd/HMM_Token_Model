although i can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie, i still found it to be absolutely amazing. it will touch you, and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie, or you just simply aren't touched by anything, it is worth seeing. don't come into the movie expecting anything, just have a box of tissues and an open mind. it is beautiful and the acting is brilliant. i think will smith, despite that he's yet again playing another lonely depressed individual, is amazing. i believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worst/best experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes you feel something. and that's exactly what this movie does. give it a chance.
