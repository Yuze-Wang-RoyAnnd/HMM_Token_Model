wonderful romance comedy drama about an italian widow (cher) who's planning to marry a man she's comfortable with (danny aiello) until she falls for his headstrong, angry brother (nicholas cage). the script is sharp with plenty of great lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (i've been told) are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful. new york has never looked so good on the screen. a must-see primarily for cher and olympia dukakis--they're both fantastic and richly deserved the oscars they got. a beautiful, funny film. a must see!
