first off, this is an excellent series, though we have sort of a james bond effect. what i mean is that while the new casino royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, dr. no (1962) being the second, while in golden eye, the first film with pierce brosnan, judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male "m" so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double-0, aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older? this is more or less a "poetic" license to thrill. we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained. no, the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago. in the 1960's communicators were fantasy. (now we call them cell phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. omg, do you think 400 years from now, they would have perfected rogaine for jean-luc picard? so, please, let's give the producers some leeway.<br /><br />but to try and make things a bit consistent, let us just ponder about the cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of battlestar galactica. if that is the case, where did all the cylons that populated the original earth come from? we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. well, what happened if one of the cyclon ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship, loaded with human-looking cylons, wound up not only jumping through space, but through time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one. they colonized it, found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves, but not before they themselves sent out a "ragtag" fleet to search for the legendary caprica, only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet, which they colonized to become the humans, who eventually invented the cylons. time paradox? of course. which came first, the chicken or the road? who cares? it's fraking entertaining!
