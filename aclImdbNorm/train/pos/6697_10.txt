i remember first watching sabrina when it came to tv in the uk on itv1 when i was 13/14. i'm now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it. i get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a "kids show" but i don't care! lol caroline rhea as "hilda" is my personal favourite character and later on morgan also became another of my favourite characters. i remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring sabrina on the tv station nickeleoden uk. i love mellissa joan-hart, she was great in "clarrissa explains all" but so much better in this. i was gutted when they decided to finish it! i hope it will soon be released on dvd here in the uk - i'll be first in line! lol x
