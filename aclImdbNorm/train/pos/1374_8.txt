a french film ester williams would love. but the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a paris exurbia finding themselves. no question where sciamma's sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as "animaux" but actually only the 3 girls are in focus, and for the entire time, with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background. marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive, but determined. she wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on floriane ( a renascence quality beauty per one reviewer) and she is also a friend of convenience to anna: not unattractive, but for her, the time of her body's perfection was short, and now she is an adolescent in a women's body. what ensues is a journey to self-realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un-natural: where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth? while the d'enouement was breath taking, with floriane's self-absorption beautifully portrayed, as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne, it all seemed abstract, sciamma's puppets.
