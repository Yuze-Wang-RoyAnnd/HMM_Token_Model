the acting in this movie was superb, but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching. it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes, so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats; the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart. worth seeing when you put the movie in it's proper context.
