as i reach the "backside" of 35 i find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed, drug influenced teens of today. it was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today. this film drives that point home to the core. if you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film. from kiss-posters to an angel concert this movie rocks ! <br /><br />watch for a young laura dern. why they didn't have more songs from the runaways i'll never know ? <br /><br />i did have a problem with randy quaid's character deflowering a 16 year old girl. while he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude's house. the cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff.<br /><br />foxes belongs right there with over the edge, fast times, dazed & confused, and kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks.<br /><br />i say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all.
