i have seen this film only once, on tv, and it has not been repeated. this is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again. usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement, but this one really scared me.<br /><br />do not read the next bit if you have'nt seen the film yet<br /><br />the scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead (they'd been poisoning her). he asks who the hell are you people anyway. one by one they give their true identities. the girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says "i am lilith, the witch who loved adam before eve".
