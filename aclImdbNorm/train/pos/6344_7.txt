i'm overwhelmed by the work of jim carrey. i keep on getting this movie stuck in my head. the grinch liking martha may, cindy lou(who's very annoying; her sweet innocence) who tries to get the grinch in the christmas spirit, the childhood of the grinch (very funny!), and moreover the weak obvious ending with- christmas isn't all about presents. i have to say, i felt stupid walking out of the theater with a bunch of babies and toddlers laughing and so forth, but this movie was a good full-lengthed adaption of dr.seuss's short film and is for all ages.
