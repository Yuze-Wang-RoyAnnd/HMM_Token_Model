zombie bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the horror genre. as i understand it from the commentary and things i have read, it was made during the huge midwest flood of 1993 when half of missouri was underwater. buildings were under water. cars and houses were underwater. one article said that zombies and the crew from this movie would help sandbag the river after shooting each day. the fact this movie got made at all is a miracle. it is like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made put through a troma filter. it is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and goofy characters. and it is fast paced and energetic and really funny.<br /><br />a toxic spill accident in a nuclear power facility causes people to melt down or turn into zombies. the local government covers it up, tears down the factory and builds houses over it. some ground shifting (?) causes a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and unleash the undead on the newly built community. from there it just gets crazy and gory and fun.<br /><br />i have read these reviews on here a few times. and it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times as a different reviewer, using fake names. they use the same words and sentences. zombie bloodbath is cheap. it is raw. it has some bad acting. so does half the movies made. there is much much worse out there than this fun movie. if you hate this film so much, don't buy it. there is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast "trailer trash." and it is obvious you are not from australia or england. it is just upsetting that this great service, the imdb does not catch people using it just to trash others. there are bad reviews and good reviews, and i don't mind those. i give both bad and good reviews myself. but it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie. sad.<br /><br />some of these so called "reviewers" even basically sue their "review" just to promote their own movies. one called this film boring - well, love it or hate it, one thing you can never say about this film is that it is boring. it moves fast and never has a dull spot.<br /><br />oh and this reviewer from the netherlands??? um - liar. you tried to post this same review at amazon and it got yanked there. the same review only it said it was from missouri.<br /><br />this nonsense has to stop. love it or hate it - give it a real review or type nothing. it is obvious you have not seen the films.<br /><br />but for the record, i have and though this one is not nearly the best that i have seen, it is far from the worst. and even the worst i would give an actual revoew and would not attack the director personally.<br /><br />hope this review helps some people see through the stupidity going on here.
