my very favorite character in films, but in nearly all of them the character of zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the villain`s can`t tell who is under that cloth then they are daft.<br /><br />but in reed hadley`s "zorro`s fighting legion" (serial 1939) the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who zorro really is.<br /><br />but anyway zorro is one of the best character`s in films and to bring it up to date l think anthony hopkins in "the mask of zorro" (1998) is a delight.<br /><br />my interest in films is vast, but l have a real liking for the serial`s of the 30s/40s....<br /><br />bond2a
