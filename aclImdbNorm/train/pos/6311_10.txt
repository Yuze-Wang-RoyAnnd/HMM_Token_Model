this movie is very hilarious, and it has a great compilation of actors like william h. macy which always have perform this kind of roles, maybe his most representative, fargo; and george clooney which is a very good actor showing his comedian work in brothers cohen film "oh brother, where art thou?" which results to be one of my favorite movies ever! but it's been hard to find "welcome to collinwood", here in mexico. my city lacks of good places where to buy some good films. i tried to buy it at blockbuster but they don't know it by the original name, so maybe it will be a little easier to find if i have the name they gave to it in mexico, do someone knows it?, because i can't remember! cheers. a.
