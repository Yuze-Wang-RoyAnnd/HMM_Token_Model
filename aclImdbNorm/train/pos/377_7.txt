genteel, softly spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre. a departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for his 1993 success, "schindler's list".<br /><br />based upon alice walder's pulitzer prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister nettie. while the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the fault of continuity and menno meyjes' scrambling screenplay. "the color purple" is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. this lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in miss walker's novel. a real shame that maestro spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director.<br /><br />performances are strong throughout, with whoopi goldberg making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken celie who just yearns to be loved. danny glover lends solid support, though his "moses" was a superior turn for him in "places in the heart". the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. good support also from margaret avery, adolph caesar and rae dawn chong.<br /><br />quincy jones ( co-producer with spielberg, kathleen kennedy and frank marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. editing from michael kahn is sound as always, while director of photography allen daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious southern scenery.<br /><br />this true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.<br /><br />wednesday, january 15, 1997 - video
