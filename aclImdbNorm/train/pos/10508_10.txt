mario is invited to princess peach's castle for cake. when mario gets there, he finds out that bowser has kidnapped her! mario must save the day again. unlike the 2-d games, mario can explore anything he wants to. he can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for 1-ups, find secrets in levels, and more. you can spend four hours in one level. no time limits. there are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into. once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight bowser at the end of the stage. to get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in. you enter the world by going through a painting. there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, i don't see how anyone could dislike this game. it's great. this launch title is the game that insured gamers that the n64 would have a good life. every 3d plat-form game we know of has something in common with sm64. banjo kazooie and banjo tooie are examples that are commonly used. super mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3d games. 10 out of 10. if you have an n64, buy this game. it's hard to find used, because no one's selling this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. a perfect 10.
