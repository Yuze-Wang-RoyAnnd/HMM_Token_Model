one of the best (if not the best) stephen king's screenings. dark as dark can be, surprising non-hollywood ending, terrifying atmosphere, amazing book adaptation, outstanding cast, educational (don't play with afterlife), in short - everything an excellent horror should be...<br /><br />my favorite horror movie, straight 10+.
