why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome!! everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. it is engaging and funny from moment one, original, and well-acted. i wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves!<br /><br />for anyone that loved the princess bride, labyrinth, and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the great ones. robert deniro is hysterical. relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man. claire danes is fantastic as always. michelle pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters...even down to facial expressions.
