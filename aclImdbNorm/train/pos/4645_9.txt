this film is very interesting. i have seen it twice and it seems glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish. i for one can relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center, and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not "think" about due to corporate media control. the outrage that glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the films is both clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic potency. i am glad i saw this film and it is even clearer that glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy. it is fine! everything is fine. see that also. people that dismiss this film as "thoughtless" or "pretentious" are really missing the boat. this is an intelligent films. if you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also very wroth while. the way you get in to his mindset is really something. you will have an experience!
