legendary director sidney lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense, and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. with an a-list cast headed by philip seymour hoffman (an oscar-worthy performance here), ethan hawke, marisa tomei and albert finney, lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as reservoir dogs, but also family stories such as ordinary people.<br /><br />many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot lumet has gone with here. instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone the tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order. i personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next. the script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife hoffman and tomei, as well as between father and son finney and hoffman. all the actors are totally engaging to watch and lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in. plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for one moment.
