a great film requiring an acquired taste. if you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you. otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again i recommend this very highly. easily the best film produced in bollywood this century.<br /><br />the only other indian film i would give 10/10 for is dil wale dulhaniya le jayenge. even then it comes second to this masterpiece.
