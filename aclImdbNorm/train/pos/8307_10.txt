tressa's vocal performance was outstanding!! tressa played the female singer role, while richard was in the club. when she first step out on stage, and started to riff and strut her stuff, it made my soul shake. her voice is platinum. she needs to make a cd. she has more fans then she realizes. i loved her show stopping performance in the five heart beats, which she also starred with leon when she was younger. how can a little girl have a voice so big. she is truly amazing.good voice good good good good voice voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic voice , back shaking , tear crying , uplifting, take you back in the days voice. tressa if you read this commit, please take my advice and start recording a cd. if not just for the love of singing, but for your fans. i believe you can truly make it. look at these other one hit single studio singers, lol.
