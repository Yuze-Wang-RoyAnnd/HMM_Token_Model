if in the 90's you're adapting a book written in the 50's, set the bloody thing in the 50's and not the '90's. see, 40 year old mores and values tend not to play as well, or ring as true, that far down the road. it's a simple rule that hollywood habitually keeps violating. and that's the problem with this film. it should have been set in the era it was written in. you'd think that would be a no-brainer, but nooo. i'd elaborate, but bmacv's comment spells it out quite well. i'll limit my commentary to rachel ward. she looks like she dieted her ass completely out of existence for this role. as a result, she looks like a crack ho' on chemotherapy, and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch in drag. i found her "i could die at any moment" look quite disconcerting, and it greatly detracted from her supposed "hotness" and the "sexual tension" the film intended to create. other than that, the film was quite good; a 7+ out of 10.
