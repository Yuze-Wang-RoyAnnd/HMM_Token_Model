in this glorious telling of a weekend shared among literary greats. mary and percy shelly,lord byron and others created a entrancing group. showing their quests for sexual enlightenment. personal freedoms from political to moral. liberal drug use for both stimulations and as addiction. their creative views of life and writing. describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their muse. along with the distractions and affections each share. with breathtaking scenery that does not detract but very much enhances the story. well created characters from grim to loving then angry to peaceful. with some of the most lovely and scene enhancing costuming to be had.
