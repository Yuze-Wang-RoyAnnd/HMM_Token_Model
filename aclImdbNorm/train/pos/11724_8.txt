elvira(cassandra peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. after she finds out that her dead aunt has left her some stuff, elvira goes to england to pick it up, hoping it will be some money. but to her horror, elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house, her dog and a cookbook. elvira decides to settle in the house anyways, but with her striking dark looks and her stunning features, she will not be able to live in peace. all the neighbours are now turning the whole town against her, and with elvira's outrageous attitude and looks, everyone better watch out, because elvira is on fire! i really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to watch get elvira into all these adventures, she's just great. the whole movie puts you into a halloween mood, sure, it's silly and the jokes are cheap but it's a pleasure to watch it. i would give elvira, mistress of the dark 8/10
