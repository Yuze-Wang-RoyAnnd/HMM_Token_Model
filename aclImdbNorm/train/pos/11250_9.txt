having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go, one can do nothing but doff one's hat - a pure masterpiece, which compared to the other le carr'e minis about smiley, has quite different qualities.<br /><br />in the minis about smiley, it is alex guiness, as smiley, who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him, one can say.<br /><br />here it is ensemble and story that's important, as the lead actor, played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes, isn't charismatic at all. <br /><br />egan just plays a guy called magnus pym, who by lying, being devious and telling people what they like to hear, is very well liked by everyone, big and small. the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex, his czech handler.<br /><br />never have the machinery behind a spy, and/or traitor, been told better! after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into 'a perfect spy', as his czech handler calls him. <br /><br />and, by following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path, once you've veered off it. he trundles on, even if he never get anything economic out of it, except promotion by his mi5 spy masters. everyone's happy, as long as the flow of faked information continues! <br /><br />magnus's father, played wonderfully by ray mcanally, is a no-good con-man, who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money. in later years it is his son who has to bail him out, again and again. but by the example set by his dad and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison, and his mom is sent off to an asylum, magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving, not telling the truth. at first he overdoes it a bit, but quickly learn to tell the right lies, and to be constant, not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad.<br /><br />his czech handler alex, expertly played by r"udiger weigang, creates, with the help of magnus, a network of non-existing informants, which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years, and years, just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war - they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned, liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 men.<br /><br />the young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than the older, little more cynic, and tired, pym, played by egan. but you buy the difference easily, as that is often the way we change through life, from enthusiasm to sorrow, or indifference.<br /><br />indeed well worth the money!
