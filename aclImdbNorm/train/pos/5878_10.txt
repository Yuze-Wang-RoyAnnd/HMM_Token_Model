garam masala is one of the funniest film i've seen in ages. akshay kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. john abraham is amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far. paresh rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. the director priyadarshan has delivered great movies in the past. hera pheri, hungama and hulchul being some of the best. garam masala is his funniest film he has made. the three newcomer actresses are average. rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie. i was impressed to see how priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time. all 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. packed with loads of laughs, this is one non stop entertainer.
