joan fontaine stars as the villain in this victorian era film. she convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on the side and also sets her sights on a wealthy man, miles rushworth who is played by herbert marshall. mr. marshall is quite good as miles. miss fontaine acted her part to perfection--she was at the same time cunning, calculating, innocent looking, frightened and charming. it takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off. joan fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by travis banton. also in the film is joan's mother, lillian fontaine as lady flora. i highly recommend this film.
