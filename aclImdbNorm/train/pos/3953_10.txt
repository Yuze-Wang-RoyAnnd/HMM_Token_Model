i saw this movie on tv when it came out, and never seen it again. for the life of me, i couldn't remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking roy thinne's movie credits. excellent, dark, and spooky tv horror movie in the same class as "crowhaven farm"; "don't be afraid of the dark"; and "satan's school for girls", all lost satanic classics. i also think it has many parallels to clint eastwood's classic, "high plains drifter". why don't they release these great little movies, especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount dvd racks at wal-mart? most of these flicks have a cult-following, so sales shouldn't be a problem.
