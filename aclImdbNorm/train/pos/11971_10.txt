i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated. when a person comes to watch a tv show, what does he look out for? it is to enjoy that he watches a show, unless he/she is a critic or a person who analyzes story. but most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy. full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office/school. it makes you laugh and it is not just humor.<br /><br />yes, the tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. if any such family existed in real world, it would be a role model for us to follow. but this is a tv show, and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television. the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, whatever be the comments later on.<br /><br />another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it, but would take back a message however childish that message be. those jesse's talks with michelle are extremely touching, if one doesn't think of it as childish.<br /><br />overall i would say after watching every show of full house, there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.
