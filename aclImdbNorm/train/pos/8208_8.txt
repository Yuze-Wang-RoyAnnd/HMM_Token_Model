i liked nearly all the movies in the dirty harry series with the exception of the one i think is titled "enforcer". "deadpool" was a bit weak in areas too, but i still enjoyed it. this one is one of my favorites of the series, if nothing else for the great line of "go ahead, make my day". this one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong. just think "magnum force" with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot. granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park. it also features dirty harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up sandra locke in a rather humorous scene. the only question that remains is why clint eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress sandra locke in so many of his movies. she brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me. granted she is not to bad here, but her character could have been so much better by someone else. another problem with this movie and other dirty harry movies, at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns. i like guns as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets it holds? still, very nice entry into the dirty harry series of movies.
