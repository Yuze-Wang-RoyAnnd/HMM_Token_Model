i approach films about talking animals with care. for every wonderful one like babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of homeward bound: the incredible journey. or in the case of cats & dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential. when i heard about paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence. but i found the film a pleasant surprise. and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.<br /><br />a russian janitor, misha vilyenkov (tony shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. one day, he hears singing coming from the basement. and when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out. misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk. and not a few phrases either. its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.<br /><br />the parrot is called paulie (voiced by jay mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in misha. wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story. which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of marie, a five year old girl with a stutter. the two of them became birds of a feather (ok, bad pun!).<br /><br />when marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly. desperate to be reunited with her, paulie begins a long journey across america, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars. of a cage that is!<br /><br />paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late 90s. and although it wasn't afforded the same recognition or box-office success of babe, paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.<br /><br />jay mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie. he never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart aleck. paulie's worldly, but he is also naive in his way.<br /><br />because he's lived a rather sheltered life with marie, when he's taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. and when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie, which he believes. only for those promises to be broken time and again.<br /><br />paulie is admittedly a little episodic. it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie. he first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by ivy (gena rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. she sympathises with paulie's situation, and drives an rv across america to find marie.<br /><br />paulie is an occasionally very touching film. his scenes with ivy are some of the best. wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers. the way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking: <br /><br />"there are things in life you put off, because you think you're gonna do them later. but the real thing ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later."<br /><br />the scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment. and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon, soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over.<br /><br />despite the occasional sad moment, there are plenty of laughs to be had. paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant. the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number. and paulie even gets to have a romance. which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief (played by mohr as well). that may be the only complaint i have. as soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film then moves paulie on to another.<br /><br />the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny, but a little disturbing too. i'm amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film. and paulie's diamond robbery is very mission impossible. he's caught in the act, and shipped off to the lab for animal testing, where he's remained ever since.<br /><br />the story finally comes full circle at the lab, where misha vows to help paulie. of course they do find marie. but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, i was left numb for several minutes. paulie may never get the longevity babe has, but i believe its an equally brilliant film. the same laughs. the same flawless effects. and the same surprising intelligence.<br /><br />a minor gem.
