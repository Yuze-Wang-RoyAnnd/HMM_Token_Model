brilliant film, the next best film to the drunken master (jackie chan). i recently bought it on an original vhs and i haven't seen this film for 15 years but still as good as it was back then. the acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film (and many other old fashioned chinese kung-fu movies) great. the choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic. i have never seen the 36th chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but gordon liu plays san te but san te in thr return to the 36th chamber is played by a different character. it has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung-fu.
