this movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film. barbara bain and donald sutherland (who play husband and wife)are positive chilling, discussing the "family business" as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaners. macy, campbell, ullman, and ritter are also terrific. they play off each other like members of a top-notch theatrical troupe, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others unselfishly. and finally, there's sammy (david dorfman). what an amazing performance from a child...and what an uncanny resemblance he has to ullman, whose son he plays!<br /><br />we're treated to a unique story in "panic," and that's a rarity in these days of tired formulaic crap. the dialogue is sharp and smart, and this relatively short film nevertheless has the power to elicit a full range of emotions from the viewer. there are places to laugh, to be shocked, to be horrified, to be saddened, to be aroused, to be angry, and to love. it's not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy, but when it's over you're more than satisfied knowing you've spent the last ninety minutes experiencing a darn good piece of work.<br /><br />more of us would go to theatres if we were treated to quality fare like this. when are the powers that be in hollywood going to wake up? it's a real shame when something this good fails to get exposure beyond festivals and households fortunate enough to have cable.
