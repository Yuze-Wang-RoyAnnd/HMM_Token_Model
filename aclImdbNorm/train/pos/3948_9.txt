so, finally i know it exists. along with the other uk contributors on here i saw this on what must have been it's only uk screening in the 70's. i remembered the title, but got nowhere when i mentioned it to people. it scarred me (that's 2 'r's) but when you go to bed with doom whizzing about your brain and listening all around for impending terror, then isn't that what a truly classic horror movie is all about?? i can barely remember the intricacies of the movie, but what i do recollect is my shivering flesh and heightened senses. can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white? again, if anyone has any info on how to obtain a copy of this, please get in touch...
