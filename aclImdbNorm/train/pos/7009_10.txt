i thought this was a wonderful movie. it touches every fiber of a human being. the love in the film is very intense. i thought it was will's best performance to date. great directing. liked the editing. music was great. good use of flashback. this is the kind of movie everyone should go see. i hope people will get something wonderful from this. overall, excellent movie. i think hollywood should make more movies with substance. even action films can have a caring story. i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting. he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see. i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about. for me, i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film. the outside world was suspended for a moment. it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world. and with this me generation it was great to see something(someone) that cared about other people more than himself.
