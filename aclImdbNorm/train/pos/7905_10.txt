i feel very sorry for people who go to movies with a pad and pencil to write down flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is. i feel equally contempt for people who go to movies and can't suspend reality and/or let themselves enjoy 90 minutes aways from their boring or busy lives! get a grip people. ecgtb is a very entertaining movie. if you take movies seriously, this is not for you. if you are expecting the movie to resemble the book in any way, this is not for you. but if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of priscilla queen of the desert, or the "what the hell am i watching" of moulin rouge. or the gross out comedy of "the sweetest thing" then let yourself escape to cowgirls. it has some really funny parts. hilarious actually. it also has some really good music;kudos to kd.lang. also did i mention it has 90 minutes of uma thurman.....need i say more?
