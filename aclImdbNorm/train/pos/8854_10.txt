the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction. two brothers, andy and hank, will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most.<br /><br />andy hanson (philip seymour hoffman) and his younger brother hank (ethan hawke) couldn't be more different. andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new york's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina (marisa tomei) who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed. hank, however, is divorc'ee who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife, his daughter's expensive school bills, and endless amount of child support payments. a man who means well and has good intentions, hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it.<br /><br />however, andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better. he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears. the pressure of his life, and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up, have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again. of course, like hank, he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it. how? by robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run. this act of betrayal is where the hanson brothers, their families, and several other lives, will be destroyed because of greed, pride, and fear. <br /><br />the uniqueness of before the devil knows you're dead is the manner in which the story is told. after the robbery goes wrong, and nanette hanson (rosemary harris) who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed, the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt. we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles (albert finney) to the death of his wife. the relationship between charles and his two sons, especially to andy, is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men. nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story.<br /><br />philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also, in contradictory way, as a man we can sympathize with. ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left. andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions.<br /><br />before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face. more than that, our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected. in what should have been best picture of the year, we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives. in other words, there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse.<br /><br />10/10
