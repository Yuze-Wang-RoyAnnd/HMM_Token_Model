i really like this movie. i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it. i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie.<br /><br />the story is very interesting. it introduces us to 6 characters; each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly. each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other. the dying master sends the 6th venom, his last student, to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed.<br /><br />how will the last pupil find the other venoms? how will he know which of them is bad? the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great.<br /><br />we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination. it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other.<br /><br />if you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start with. it doesn't get any better than this.
