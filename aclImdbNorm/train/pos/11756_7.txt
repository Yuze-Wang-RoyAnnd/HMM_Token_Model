the film did not do well at the box office.<br /><br />i saw it in a sneak preview.<br /><br />i have always enjoyed the film.<br /><br />i live in 1 of the cities mentioned in the film where past players moved to.<br /><br />not the best film ever put to screen, but enjoyable.<br /><br />robin did well with his role.<br /><br />best line of the film at the beginning, by robin's character jack: "i was that sob!" cleaned up here as not to offend anyone.<br /><br />was glad when it came to dvd a few years back in the wide screen/letter box format.<br /><br />i am not a football fan or a real sports fan. but, you do not need to be one to like this film.
