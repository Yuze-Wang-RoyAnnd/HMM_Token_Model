all dogs go to heaven is, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. i'm not really a big fan of animated films, but there's something about this one that makes it better than any other animated film i've seen. the music is wonderful as is the performances of burt reynolds, dom deluise, and especially ken page as the king gator. "let's make music together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any movie musical i've seen. this is definitely a must see for people of all ages.
