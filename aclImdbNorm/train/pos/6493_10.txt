i remember watching this as a child in the uk, mesmerized by the story and laurence olivier's narration. we would talk about nothing else at school the next day. i imagine the ratings for the first showing were huge. this is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series despite the fact they had to cut the story down to the bone they managed to capture so much. what is interesting is that the battles of britain and north africa were pivotal yet are widely unrecognized as such by americans. the series captures the rivalry between mountbatten and the american generals, the suffering of german troops on the eastern front, the maltreatment of japanese prisoners of war by american troops. the images of the holocaust made me, a non-jewish european, feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish people. i don't know why this is not number one in the imdb rankings. perhaps they are showing their bias against documentaries. spoiler - we win.
