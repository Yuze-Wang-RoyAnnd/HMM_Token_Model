this is the first 10 out of 10 that i've given any movie. what made this movie so good for me? constant action - there isn't any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. finally, i get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).<br /><br />i liked the first two bourne movies, but i loved this one.<br /><br />warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
