this film show peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in austria. it shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples. it show the inability of people to communicate or talk with others.<br /><br />in the screening i have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film. and rightly so. because the film is not and easy one to watch. it has a very depressing message and there isn't any moment of mercy in the film. it is a very cruel movie, not for everyone's taste. you can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film. it grips you in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensity.<br /><br />i can not "recommend" or "not recommend" this film. you should make your own mind based on what i have said earlier. just be aware that this is not a regular film and it is not for everyone's taste.
