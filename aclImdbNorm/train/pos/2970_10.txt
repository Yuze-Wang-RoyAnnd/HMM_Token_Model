i thought that baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen! it's witty humour made me giggle all the way through, and the fact that trey and matt are so over the top, boosts the film's comedy. <br /><br />i have just bought baseketball on dvd and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it. i have a very short attention span and i think this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout. the humorous quotes are memorable, and can make me laugh for hours if i remember them later..<br /><br />so overall i think that baseketball is brilliant movie which everyone should go see, especially if you're younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards. <br /><br />p.s does anybody think its weird for me to like them both? hehe
