i myself feel this film is a rare treasure. not only is it the beginning of shirley temple's career, but a rare look on how our society has changed. you have to understand, certain things we today would view as sexual, back then would be considered innocent. for example, the parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw this as just children mimicking adults. most people didn't think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive, other than teenage boys lusting over teenage girls. to them it wasn't sexual. mind you this was before we had internet, tv, etc... most sex crimes weren't openly brought up. occasionally there would be a whisper about the kid with the "funny uncle." but that was often all that came of it. yes very sad. but it is kinda sad today, for even i too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended, innocent and funny. when i saw shirley dance like that and the boys eye balling her, yes i felt disturbed. i have to remind myself the time this took place! those children didn't know what sex was. the parents knew that, both those of the children in the movie and those watching it. the thought may not have even entered their minds. in the eyes of the average adult back then, this was no more sexual then if shirley was playing house. even today kids will enter beauty contest, many dressed up extremely maturely, for a three yr old. however the child is merely pretending. i don't blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. or the old movies that display this. in all honesty, our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong. this sometimes can be for the best. but i truly believe this movie isn't one of them. it gives a rare look of an innocent mentality, that we have long lost.
