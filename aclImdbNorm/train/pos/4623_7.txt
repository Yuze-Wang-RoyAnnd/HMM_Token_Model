despite its rather salacious title, this is a light teen dramedy. unless you're an old coot, you'll probably find it likeable. it isn't so good on developing characters or situations smoothly, though. when you view it, you get the feeling that you've been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you've been sitting down watching the whole time. this is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters, and they are appealing enough. jennifer connelly is the heartthrob of many, i know, but i've always liked the more obscure maddie corman. the teens get most of the screen time without a lot of intrusions from those pesky grown-ups. is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike?
