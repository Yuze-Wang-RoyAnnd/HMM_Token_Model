oh man, why? "six degrees" is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone. if focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />when i first heard of this show, it didn't caught my attention at all. it seemed too ordinary, actually. then, i saw some episodes... and loved it! first of all, the characters. they are all well-written and different from each other. there's a alcohol addicted, a woman whose fianc'ee cheats on her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on... unlike what we're used to, most of the characters interact with each other in casualties, like in our daily routines. great! my favourite ones are mae, carlos and whitney.<br /><br />then, the cast. they are all great. jay hernandez, from "hostel", shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as paxton. the other ones give great performances too, specially campbell scott, who plays steven and bridget moynahan, who plays whitney.<br /><br />well when i came to imdb, after watching some episodes, i couldn't believe that it got cancelled. seriously, i can't understand the low ratings.<br /><br />it's too bad it didn't have more than one season. it would really be a good show to follow!
