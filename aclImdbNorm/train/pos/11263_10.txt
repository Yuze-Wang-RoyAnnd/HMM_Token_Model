this is an excellent show! i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this. there are many "facts" in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well, in a way that is unforgettable.<br /><br />mr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students. use of live actors performing "skits" is also very entertaining. <br /><br />i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down.
