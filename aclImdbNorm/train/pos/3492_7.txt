not as bad a film as i thought it would be.<br /><br />it has a good cast.nice to see roger moore back on screen as well as the use of other british actors.<br /><br />would like to see more of olivia d`abo in future projects.maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy maryam d`abo.<br /><br />also a good use of unseen locations such as luxembourg.<br /><br />hopefully we will see more uk-european co-productions like this.
