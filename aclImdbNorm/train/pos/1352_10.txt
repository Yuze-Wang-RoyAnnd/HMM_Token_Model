never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors. in the period that this film was made, people in america were different, there was no tv or all the modern things we have today, except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood. sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today. ann shirley,"murder my sweet",'44 played a young orphan gal who was called carrot top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks, who were like two wise owls and watched over ann shirley. it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened, the entire town found out about it within minutes. it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living. today, it seems very corn ball and stupid, but believe me, this was the way people were in america during the 1920'. & 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family films.
