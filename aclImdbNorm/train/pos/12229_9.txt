to me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi. as a kid in the 50s thats all there was. in 1957 i saw "the first man into space" in a movie theater with my dad. it had marshall thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. it is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. scared the good & plenty right out of me. the memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives within me. the incredible melting man is almost a re-make only in full glorious color...that is wherever the scenes were well-lit. just gotta love it for what it is......a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting noises, and that eerie music. bravo !
