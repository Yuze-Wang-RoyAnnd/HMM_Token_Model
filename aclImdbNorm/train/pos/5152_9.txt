"hitler, the rise of evil" is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of world war 2. which makes watching a refreshing experience.<br /><br />i think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the nazi-mechanism. of the utterly corrupt ways hitler used to make it to the top. having arrived there, this film ends.<br /><br />when on top, the 'fuhrer' (= german for 'leader') led his germany to the biggest & most devastating war in history of mankind. ending six years later in germany's utter defeat. as a result, germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its prewar soil), and was forced to accept a 44 year-split of its remaining territory. both west and east germany had to be rebuilt from scrap, their reputations severely damaged by the many nazi-atrocities inspired by racism.<br /><br />as i said, "hitler, the rise of evil" makes an good watch. set in an acceptable thirties-environment, with (more than) competent acting. in particular peter o'toole's role as the aged president von hindenburg stands out, even adds an extra dimension.<br /><br />my copy of "hitler, the rise of evil" also provides a second dvd with two good documentary films. one is about hitler's personality, the second deals with the forgery of the hitler-diaries. in 1983 this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in england and germany, damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists.
