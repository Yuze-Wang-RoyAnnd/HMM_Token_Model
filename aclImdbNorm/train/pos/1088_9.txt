cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams. it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget.<br /><br />there are many great laughs (even if the story is somewhat thin) sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style. a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses, which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience. as he makes his exit, he assures the client (grant) that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100.00 from the total...or at least $50.00...but certainly $25.00. hilarious!
