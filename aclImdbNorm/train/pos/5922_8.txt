i found this movie to be exciting right from the start--like a spielberg movie is--and found the plot to be intriguing as i tried to figure out what the actual situation was.<br /><br />right from the start--before the opening credits-- the action starts, bringing with it immediate suspense.<br /><br />the two main characters are very likable. (i have trouble liking any of the baldwins, due to alec's extra-curricular, political activities, but william was not too bad in this movie.)<br /><br />there were several highly unexpected twists, which contributed to the enjoyment.<br /><br />there were, unfortunately, many places where there was an annoying high pitch sound in the soundtrack--something like 19k hz. i suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set.
