the first thing i thought after watching "mystery men" was how could this movie be so unpopular? i found this movie so adorable and funny that it's status as a bomb defies logic. well, i hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit, and you can count me amoung it's fans.<br /><br />simply put, and without giving too much away, this movie does for comic books what "the princess bride" did for fairy tales and "who framed roger rabbit?" did for classic cartoons. that should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to (this is one of those cases like "the iron giant" where the studio had no clue what it had on it's hands). rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little offbeat. you won't listen to the beegees in the same light ever again.
