although the recent re-telling of part of homer's epic "troy" with brad pitt was entertaining once, "iphigenia" with the incandescent irene pappas is breathtaking. unfolding in a natural setting with greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity. a chance encounter with this film on one of directv's many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems. there is no glitter or "bling" in this movie, just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil. i think even homer, if he really existed, would be proud of this telling.<br /><br />jlh
