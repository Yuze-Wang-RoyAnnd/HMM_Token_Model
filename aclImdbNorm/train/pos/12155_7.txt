i had watched (and recorded) this a few years back on local tv and, having been underwhelmed by it, i subsequently erased the tape; however, when it was released by mgm as part of a "midnite movie" double-feature dvd of curtis harrington/shelley winters films for a very affordable price, i couldn't resist giving it a second look (this has since gone out-of-print). actually, i received the dvd a few months ago but only now, with harrington's passing, did i get to it; thankfully, this time around i was more receptive to the film and, in fact, now consider it one of the more satisfying whatever happened to baby jane? (1962) imitations (with whom, incidentally, it shared screenwriter henry farrell).<br /><br />the film offers a splendid evocation of 1930s depression america - with its child-star craze and sensational murders (exploited during the fake newsreel opening); it's stylishly made (kudos to lucien ballard's cinematography and the set design by eugene lourie') and boasts an effective david raksin score. shelley winters, debbie reynolds and michael macliammoir deliver excellent performances; the latter is especially impressive as the larger-than-life and vaguely sinister diction coach (though he ultimately proves a mere red herring!). also featured are dennis weaver and agnes moorehead (hers is only a cameo, really, as the evangelist she plays is mostly heard over the radio).<br /><br />many seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids (including an amusing mae west imitation), but i personally wasn't bothered by them; the film does slightly overstay its welcome due to an unhurried pace and (perhaps needlessly) convoluted plot. reynolds - a musical star herself - is ideally cast as the dancing-school owner and, despite their on-set rivalry, she and winters work well together. the latter, in fact, gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in whoever slew auntie roo? (1971); the narrative, then, comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected grand guignol-type denouement. apparently, the film was toned down (it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of lesbianism!) by producer martin ransohoff - against harrington's wishes - in order to get a pg rating...
