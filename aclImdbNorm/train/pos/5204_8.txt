i don't watch much porn, but i love porn stars. and i love gory movies. so when i heard about a porn-star gore movie, i was really excited. of course, that was years ago and when i heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie, i never thought i'd actually get to see it. but i did and i'm not ashamed to admit i loved it, even with all its flaws.<br /><br />first, the flaws. the story is set in ireland and is called samhain, but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the sawney beane clan from scotland. so why not just set it there and skip the third-grade report about samhain/irish immigrants/halloween? also, it breaks its own rules by stating that you're safe on the trails, but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere. it's never clear how many cannibals we're dealing with. there's a big stone castle that's obviously ancient, yet no one's noticed it before. the self-conscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters. the heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met. the ending makes no sense.<br /><br />so what works? the gore! sure i would have liked more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasn't afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie. two murders are waay over the top and taylor hayes has a nice disgusting scene. the two wild murders are even given extended shots on the dvd. i've always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil breed reinforced that.
