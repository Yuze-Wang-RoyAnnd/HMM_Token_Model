had fun watching this film.. despite the feeling i got a lot of the time, that this film was almost copying monsters inc. there're quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two, the relationship between an animal/monster and a small child, other animals trying to break that relationship, etc. it felt like that pretty much throughout the film, to me.<br /><br />one of the redeeming features though, is scrat :) very very funny character, even if he serves no purpose :)
