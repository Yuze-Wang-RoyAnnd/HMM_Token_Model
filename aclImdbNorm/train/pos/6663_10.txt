this movie is about a dysfunctinal family but not just any dysfunctional family. it is about the family of the father of our nation (india) although, the film focuses mainly on the estranged relationship between mahatma gandhi and his eldest son harilal gandhi. it shows how the mahatma had to kill m.k. gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life in order to achieve our freedom. every time mohandas karamchand gandhi and his son would try to get close the mahatma would come between them. this is a beautifully done film. akshaye khanna has proved himself to be a top actor. he expressed emotions very naturally. darshan jariwala who mainly stars in plays-gurukant desai's lawyer in guru has portrayed gandhi wonderfully.(as a real human being, unlike ben kingsley who made him look like a god) shefali shah the girl from monsoon wedding has also done a really good job of showing how kasturba gandhi was torn between father and son. this movie is touching and so is its soundtrack "raghupati raghava" sung in a very unique manner. i saw this movie just 3 hours ago(it released in dubai a day earlier-on the 2nd) and when the movie was over there was "pin drop silence" and while exiting out of the theatre not one person pushed another( can you imagine us indians not pushing ?) not one ! there was a sacred silence...
