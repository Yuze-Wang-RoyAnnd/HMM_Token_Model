with this movie, it's all about style, atmosphere, and acting. true, i didn't believe all of the plot developments, but it didn't matter- the terrific acting, the unexpected plot twists, and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in, and carried me along for the ride, and i had a great time. kenneth branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents, and he proves it once again with a flawless georgia accent. he's surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles (robert downey, jr., embeth davidtz from schindler's list and fallen, tom berenger, daryl hannah, and robert duvall) that i was simply blown away. i recently bought a copy of this movie, and i never tire of watching it. simply one of the best thrillers of the year. if you've ignored this movie (and chances are you have), then i suggest you check it out.
