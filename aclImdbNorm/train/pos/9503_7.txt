a bit slow and boring, the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman, the brothers sitting on the porch, the wealthy cigar smoking man. the photography of the river is marvelous, as is the interior period decoration. if you like decoration of banana republic stores, this is a must.
