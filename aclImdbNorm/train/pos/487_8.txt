a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character.<br /><br />	it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date (thank goodness they didn't give it to ralph fiennes, who would have murdered it.) similarly, emily watson shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage). to reach the tortured chess master (turturro) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love. watson does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring.<br /><br />	in a chance meeting between natalia (watson) and luzhin, she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that, we realize later in the film, has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations. later, as their love affair develops, she subtly likens dancing to chess (luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with "bold, brilliant moves" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover).<br /><br />	this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and, in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (or so we are led to believe - certainly, within the time frame, natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother).<br /><br />	the italian sets are stunning. the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie-goer, yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit, and most deservedly so. chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie, although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess-player that the characters existed. although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author, the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting.
