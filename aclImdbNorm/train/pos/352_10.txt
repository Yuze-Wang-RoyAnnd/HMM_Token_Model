i just saw "valentine" and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i've seen in years. unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks, this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking. for those out there that hated "scream," there is not one reference to "the horror rules" in this movie (even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here). <br /><br />this is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror. you get the style, cinematography, and good acting of 90's films and the stalking-slasher madness of an 80's flick. i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for. this is definitely a move in the right direction.<br /><br />denise richards stands out here as a fun character. you can tell she liked her role, and that makes her stand out. i loved her in this movie.
