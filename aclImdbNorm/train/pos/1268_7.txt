just cause takes some of the best parts of three films, cape fear, a touch of evil and silence of the lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film.<br /><br />sean connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former assistant district attorney, kate capshaw and he's a crusader against capital punishment. blair underwood's grandmother ruby dee buttonholes connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson's appeal. he's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl.<br /><br />when connery arrives in this rural florida county he's up against a tough sheriff played by laurence fishburne who's about as ruthless in his crime solving as orson welles was in touch of evil. <br /><br />later on after connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he's uncovered, he's feeling pretty good about himself. at that point the film takes a decided turn from touch of evil to cape fear.<br /><br />to say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly. the cast uniformly turns in some good performances. special mention must be made of ed harris who plays a hannibal lecter like serial killer on death row with underwood. he will make your skin crawl and he starts making connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises he's been basing his convictions on. many a confirmed liberal i've known has come out thinking quite differently once they've become a crime victim.<br /><br />of course the reverse is equally true. many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed.<br /><br />criminal justice is not an end, but a process and a never ending one at that for all society. i guess if just cause has a moral that would probably be it.
