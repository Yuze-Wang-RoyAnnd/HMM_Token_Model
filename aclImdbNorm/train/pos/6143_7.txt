never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the walt disney studios and great animation creations. angela lansbury, (eglantine price) played an outstanding role as a woman who had taken a course in witch craft and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a broomstick and had quite a few difficulties taking off. eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world. however, eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch. mr. emerlius browne, (david tomlinson) was the person who sold eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution. eglantine has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the nazi's from evading england. great family entertainment and we need more films like this today.
