robert mitchum stars as clint tollinger in this short but tough western: man with the gun. tollinger is a professional town tamer - as in, when a town needs someone to save itself; he is the one who is brought in to do it. tollinger's latest gig comes by as an accident: strolling into town looking for his former fling, he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster. but many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired tollinger, as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing (suddenly high plains drifter seems less original). <br /><br />man with the gun starts off as an average western tough-guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses. what starts off as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends up dark and character-centered. the entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable. mitchum is his usual excellent self here in man with the gun - not one of his very best performances, mitchum still has his classic and effective tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action-packed, meaningful, and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park. man with the gun is a nice mitchum western and is easily worth one's time.
