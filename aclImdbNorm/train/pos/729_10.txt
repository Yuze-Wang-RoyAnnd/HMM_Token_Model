i seriously love this film so much, i never get sick of watching it. the only line i really can't stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that, everything else is perfect. i've never been a fan of pj soles and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie, but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part. most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really.. that's the only reason i love it so much. i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over, haha. one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance , down the halls of the high school.. i love it. the special edition dvd has a good retrospective, surprisingly pj soles isn't on it. maybe she was working on another project *laugh* anyway, great film, even better if you're a ramones fan.
