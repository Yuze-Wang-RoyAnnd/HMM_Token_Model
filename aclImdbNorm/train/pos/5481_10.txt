to me this was more a wake up call, and realization that most all we see, hear, read and think about most anything, is dependent on what the media feeds us. this is a classic example of high level spin doctors attempting to control the masses through controlled information. it is also an excellent example of how people that have a constitution that they freely bought in to, will not be swayed by this media control or any attempted mis-information. once again this shows that at the end of the day the needs of the many will in fact outweigh the needs of the few. it is also enlightening to see that in in a country where there is no religious civil war going on, that democracy is not a real hard thing to implement.
