barbra streisand's first television special was simply fantastic! from her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store -- everything was top-notch! it was easy to understand how this special received awards.<br /><br />not muddled down by guest appearances, the focus remained on barbra thoughout the entire production.
