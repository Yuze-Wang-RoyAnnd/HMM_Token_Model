a young girl surviving as a prostitute.<br /><br />a cheap hustler who wants to get the big score.<br /><br />they meet each other in thailand. you may think by the opening titles it's going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life. this film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images, but still refreshing. this story is also about eros and thanatos. "it's not an original joke but it is well told" says a character and that also applies to this one: we've seen the story but this way we see it. thailand appears in hot tones, the photograph going from one colored to a multicolored place. and it captures the city as the cage of this imperfect persons. there is also a good use of the music to dot the actions.
