'holes' was a great movie. disney made the right choice. every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it. everyone casted was fit for the part they had, and shia labeouf really has a future with acting. sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden, she was exactly how i imagined her. everyone who hasn't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will 'dig it'.
