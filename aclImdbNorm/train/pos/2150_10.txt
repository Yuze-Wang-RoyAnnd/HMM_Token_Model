if you are tired of films trying too hard to be fairy tales (the "pretty woman" variety love story), here is a beautiful film in which a japanese businessman is pulled free from his robotic, dispassionate life when he falls in love...with dancing. wonderfully drawn characters bring to life a story that is at once deeply funny and poignantly moving.
