most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else. i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable. however, because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films. a perfect example was the john garfield film air force--in which a b-17 nearly single-handedly takes out half the japanese air force! however, pride of the marines is a welcome departure--scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. when i first saw this film, i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true. however, after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor. this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!
