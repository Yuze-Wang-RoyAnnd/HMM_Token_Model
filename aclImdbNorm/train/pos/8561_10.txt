when two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of breakfast at tiffany's, you know something is going to go right. drew barrymore, patrick highsmith, leslie hope, and sally kellerman are excellent actors. the fbi agent was a terrible actor. the scenes where patrick looked holly up and down like some sort of objectifier, those was just weird. drew barrymore is very hot. intimate strangers, where sally kellerman worked, was a great part. the weird gummy worm was just weird. nathan was a very handsome cat. but what was that scene where patrick followed holly into a cesspool and mr. gooding attacked him? and the scene with dr. wallace? what was he doing fumbling around in there? and not every male has a female, as sally kellerman stated. and when patrick and elizabeth saw drew outside of victor's, that was weird.
