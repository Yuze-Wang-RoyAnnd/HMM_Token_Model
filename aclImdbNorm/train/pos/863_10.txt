i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute. it is brilliantly shot, with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed. the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike. she hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. he's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. the film transcends into a dark film noir, with a couple of truly excellent scenes, and an even better finale. the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability. the use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping, that's for sure. throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film. it's the sort of film hollywood really wants to make, but just can't.
