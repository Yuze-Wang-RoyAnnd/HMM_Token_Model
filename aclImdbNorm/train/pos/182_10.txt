if you are uninitiated to the gundam world, this is a good place to start. if you are burned out on star wars or star trek, here is a compelling, realistic sci-fi series you can become immersed in. not the simplistic boy-saves-world-in-giant robot story you might have expected, but rather a complex, emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the "good" and "bad" guys is decidedly less than distinct.<br /><br />gundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha, a young, naive boy living in a neutral space colony. he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends. during the course of this series, al befriends an "enemy" soldier, bernie wiseman. by the end, little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice.<br /><br />i loved this oav series, with its cool mecha designs, involving story, and likeable characters. i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime, or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment.
