although some may call it a "cuban cinema paradiso", the movie is closer to a how green was my valley, a memory film mourning for a lost innocence. the film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides (pro-castro? anti-castro?, focusing instead in the human frailty of the characters and the importance of family. filled with good acting, in particular from mexican actress diana bracho, who plays keitel's wife. a masterpiece, filled with references to classic movies, from casablanca to chaplin's city lights. gael garcia bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story. tv director georg stanford brown, in a rare return to acting (remember the rookies?), plays a homeless bum who acts as greek chorus, superbly. it is a pity that this movie, originally titled dreaming of julia, has been released in the states by thinkfilm with the atrocious title of cuban blood, which has nothing to do with the movie.
