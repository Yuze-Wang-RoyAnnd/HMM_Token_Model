ealing studios, a television and film production company based in west london, claims to be the oldest film studio in the world. though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the 1930s, its golden age was most certainly between 1948 and 1955, when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces, many starring the great alec guinness. such well-known titles include 'whisky galore!
