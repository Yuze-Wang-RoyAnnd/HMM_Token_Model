gojoe is part of a new wave of japanese cinema, taking very creative directors, editors and photographers and working on historic themes, what the japanese call "period pieces". gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography, and editing. brilliant, even. the new wave of japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture, but not really explored in kurosawa's samurai epics, or the zaitochi series. another fine example of this genre is onmyoji (2001). i would place director sogo ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave japanese directors. other recent japanese period pieces i would highly recommend include yomada's twilight samurai (2002) and shintaro katsu's zatoichi: the blind swordsman (2003).
