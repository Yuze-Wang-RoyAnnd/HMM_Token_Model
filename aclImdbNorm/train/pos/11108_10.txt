well... easily my favourite tv series ever. call me a walking mail clich'e but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs etc. on a show and you're already winning points on in my book. combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you've ever seen on the small screen, add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind (and a few brains a long the way) and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with.<br /><br />above all stand two actors, james gandolfini as tony soprano, and edie falco as his wife carmela... as for gandolfini, he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express, if you haven't seen him as tony yet see it now!<br /><br />i can go on and on and on about every character in the show, the psychological brilliance, the gripping scenes etc. but you wouldn't be able to stop me so all i can say is that this is about the only show along with seinfeld, that i am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more.
