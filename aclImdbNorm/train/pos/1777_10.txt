when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant! however, on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful film-making. this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film history.<br /><br />the opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment.<br /><br />sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal, revenge and the importance of companionship. this movie is any director's dream at its very core.<br /><br />however, sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking. the writing, provided by scribe tim sheridan, was just as breathtaking.<br /><br />the dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. specifically speaking, the final scene (warning: spoilers!!! spoilers!!!) where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time, is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen. sheridan is the next robert towne.<br /><br />in a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat.<br /><br />therefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer. never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail. a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easy.<br /><br />all in all this film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. this is the art of film at its best. when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is more.<br /><br />the romeo division is groundbreaking, a masterpiece and, most importantly, the romeo division is indeed art.
