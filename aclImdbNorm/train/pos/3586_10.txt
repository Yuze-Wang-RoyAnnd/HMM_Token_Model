i first saw this when it premiered more than ten years ago. i saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me. she fought alone is about a girl, caitlin (played by tiffani thiessen), who is raped by jace (played by david lipper), a classmate who enjoys hurting girls. caitlin is in a popular high school clique, but when she reveals she is raped the clique turns against her, led by ethan (played by brian austin green).<br /><br />this movie chronicles caitlin's struggle against an entire town, including a high school that essentially lets athletes determine the social environment, allowing them to get away with whatever they wish.<br /><br />thiessen and green are the top performers, and there is real chemistry between the two of the them throughout the entire film. all of the actors in this film, which was inspired by actual events, did a great job. she fought alone really captures the essence of what it is like to be in high school (at least in 1995), and having one's self-esteem and reputation at stake. recommended. 10/10
