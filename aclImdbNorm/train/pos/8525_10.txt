in order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it's supposed to be: children's. they had more guidelines to follow in order to make this movie (meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st) taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch. sequels usually make me nervous, however this one did pretty well for itself. knowing that it didn't have the star power of fraiser as george they capitalized on the humor and i believe showeman did pretty well as the lead. the plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it, but if you want to watch a simple, fun, energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one.
