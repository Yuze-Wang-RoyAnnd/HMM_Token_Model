the best cheech & chong movie so far!! of all the cheech and chong this is most certain the best so far. i think i've seen them all about twelve times at least, and i love them all. but this is most definitely the best. compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs. part of the texts are still part of our language today, after 25 years. i hope that one day they can make another one, because they still are great comedians. i heard they are writing a new script so who knows... i guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre. i wonder if john ashcroft ever watched one of them...
