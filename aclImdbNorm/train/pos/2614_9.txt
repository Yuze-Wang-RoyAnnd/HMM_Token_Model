why has this not been released? i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn't been. how wrong can a girl be! this film is, in a word, enthralling.<br /><br />you will be captivated. it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows.<br /><br />the final part of the film, the "episode" as it were (not giving anything away, you saw that in the trailer) is also unmissable. you will chose a favourite, you will be shocked, you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens. the adrenalin rises and you cant not watch. cudos to the actors, it's very believable. and it doesn't stop there, they have a final shock for you.<br /><br />it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch. and how far away from this are we, really? endemol (who make big brother) made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman's kidney to patients in need of a transplant. the show was revealed at the end to be a hoax, ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation, but are we getting too close for comfort?
