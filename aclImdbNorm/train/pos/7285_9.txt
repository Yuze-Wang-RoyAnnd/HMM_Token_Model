this movie scared heck out of me when i was just a kid. it's no "citizen kane" but it has its moments. the arm ripping scene is good. the plot is good even if characters aren't - could have something to do with the acting. put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get. this was one of those shoot, edit (what little there was) and distribute in a couple of months type of movies. this is classic low budget sci-fi and deserves it just due. i rated it a 9 based other films of this genre and age.
