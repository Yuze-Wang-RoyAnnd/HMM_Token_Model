excellent. gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the western plains with an emphasis on the woman's role and place. a moving film, lovingly made, and based on real people and their actual experiences. low budget, independent film; never made any money. definitely not the romanticized, unrealistic hollywood version of pioneer life.
