the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world. when war finally does arrive, it's ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed. adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the "wandering sickness", a pestilence that continues for another four years.<br /><br />"things to come" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. the "wings over the world" concept plays out a bit corny, though it's spokesman cabal (raymond massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. if he fails, others will follow. this message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly in massey's end of movie speech. man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an "all the universe or nothing" mindset.<br /><br />the film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film "metropolis". as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition. where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969.<br /><br />"things to come" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. which side will you come down on, the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? it's not a comfortable question, as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes. those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control.
