laurence olivier, merle oberon, ralph richardson, and binnie barnes star in "the divorce of lady x," a 1938 comedy based on a play. olivier plays a young barrister, everard logan who allows oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the london fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home. the next day, a friend of his, lord mere (richardson), announces that his wife (barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel, and he wants to divorce her. believing the woman to be oberon, olivier panics. oberon, who is single and the granddaughter of a judge, pretends that she's the lady in question, lady mere, when she's really leslie steele.<br /><br />we've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time. with this cast, it's delightful. i mean, richardson and olivier? olivier and oberon, that great team in wuthering heights? pretty special. olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight, nervous barrister. oberon gives her role the right light touch. she looks extremely young here, fuller in the face, with jean harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her. she wears some beautiful street clothes, though her first gown looks like a birthday cake, and in one gown she tries on, with that hair-do, she's ready to play snow white. binnie barnes is delightful as the real lady mere.<br /><br />the color in this is a mess, and as others have mentioned, it could really use a restoration. definitely worth seeing.
