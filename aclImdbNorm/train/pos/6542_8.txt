although well past the target audience, i've always had a soft spot for ya fiction, so, i was naturally intrigued by the return of nancy drew to the screen.<br /><br />this is not a bad film. the central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth. nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset.<br /><br />what i really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.<br /><br />emma roberts is great as nancy drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery.
