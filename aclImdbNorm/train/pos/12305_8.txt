wasn't quite sure what to expect with this one, outside of the uniform positive reviews i've read. turns out, i could have never imagined this movie, because it's very close to "the bride with white hair" in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic. this walks a fine line between being a farce, a comedy, and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling. there's nothing scary about it, that's not the theme, it's really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost, who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts. so the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. this also takes place in ancient china, with wild outlandish kung fu exhibitions, and a trip to hell (more or less). some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are top rate all the way. i could watch this genre of chinese movies all day, because they are highly entertaining, great visuals, and pretty much tongue-in-cheek. and i'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also. highly recommended.
