orson welles' "the lady from shanghai" does not have the brilliant screenplay of "citizen kane," e.g., but charles lawton, jr.'s cinematography, the unforgettable set pieces (such as the scene in the aquarium, the seagoing scene featuring a stunning, blonde-tressed rita hayworth singing "please don't love me," and the truly amazing hall of mirrors climax), and the wonderful cast (everett sloane in his greatest performance, welles in a beautifully under-played role, the afore-mentioned miss hayworth--welles' wife at the time--at her most gorgeous) make for a very memorable filmgoing experience. the bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling, not inscrutable at all. the viewer is surprised by the twists and turns, and welles' closing line is an unheralded classic. "the lady from shanghai" gets four stars from this impartial arbiter.
