the 4th pokemon movie made me cry when celebi died. don't you dare say that pokemon sucks! i don't like it when people say that.... i've liked pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy pokemon, including this movie and other pokemon movies. so, without further ado, please say that pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages. and also, why do pokemon-haters give low ratings for all or most of the pokemon movies? i don't understand.... they shouldn't do that.... there's absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that pokemon sucks besides the fact that: 1) pokemon is for little kids only. 2) pokemon is stupid. and 3) people shouldn't like pokemon. i think this is why people don't like pokemon.
