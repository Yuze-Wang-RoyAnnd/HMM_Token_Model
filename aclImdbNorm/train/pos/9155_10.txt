who ever came up with story is one sick person. i rented it for our slumber party sleepover and all six of us got freaked out cause we're all in an acting class together, and we know a couple of the actors from class. besides everybody screaming the whole freaky night, i had freaky nightmares. i kept thinking oh my god, if i get up to go to the bathroom to pee i'm going to be stabbed in the middle of wiping or something. i couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this gruesome horror movie. i also thought why are all the girls topless in this movie but we don't any of the boys units? you should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and chopping off units. i would watch that over and over. call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. i'm only giving this movie a 9 because you freaked me out freaks.
