i got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect. the premise seemed silly and i assumed it would be a lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. what a great surprise. i laughed so hard i cried at some of the jokes. this film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. ok.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (jack palance?) or small children. the language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. what's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet love story. my girlfriend and i both loved it. steve carell is terrific, but (like the office) the supporting cast really makes the film work. all of the characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and likability. everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect. i can't wait to get the dvd. i'm sure it will be up there with office space for replays and quotable lines.
