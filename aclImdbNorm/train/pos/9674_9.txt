i didn't give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like "citizen kane" and "seven samaurai." however, this movie is so all-around wonderful, it's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general imdb voter. however, the imdb voter leans to the geeky, and "paulie" doesn't qualify for that.<br /><br />the only acting criticism i might suggest is that hallie kate eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child. i'm sorry, but asking a 6 year-old child to out-do dustin hoffman as the rainman is asking for the impossible in film-making.<br /><br />moving past that minor complaint, the movie has the best of many films: buddy road-trip, con-games, hero as friendly party-animal (party-bird?), disney-like humor for young and old, etc. what's not to like? tony shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans. that's normal for him, it seems. ("i'm russian... i like long stories.) i don't like mangoes, but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one. watch the movie and that will make sense.<br /><br />buddy hackett and cheech marin make very appropriate appearances in the film. roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them. i have always found jay mohr to be a bit slimy, and his on-screen role fits that as well. the only surprise to me was finding that jay was also paulie's voice. in the end, even that works well; put parrot and anti-parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own.<br /><br />if you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either, "paulie" is a perfect candidate. i will, however, admit that a happy moment colors my review of "paulie." i was on a road-trip during a major heat-wave. the car's air-conditioning died, half the restaurants had dead cooling (as did our hotel) and i said, "let's watch a movie where there is working air-conditioning." so we did. so for 100 minutes we were cooled, amused, and given a heart-warming experience. when i saw it recently on vcr under less emotional circumstances, i realized just how well this movie was made.<br /><br />it's a sleeper film you won't regret watching.
