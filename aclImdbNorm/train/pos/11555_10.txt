a simple comment...<br /><br />what can i say... this is a wonderful film that i can watch over and over. it is definitely one of the top ten comedies made. with a great cast, jack lemmon and walter matthau wording a perfect script by neil simon, based on his play.<br /><br />it is real to life situation done perfectly. if you have digital cable, one gets the menu on bottom of screen to give what is on. it usually gives this film ***% stars but in reality it deserves **** stars. if you really watch this film, one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now.
