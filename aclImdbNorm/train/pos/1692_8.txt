like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or r-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults. for example of the adult level humor, the martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors. the martian pilot, blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson; the scientist, that of peter seller's dr. strangelove. the special effects are surprisingly good for this film. the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is wayne alexander's "vern" character). i had to write this review... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-i'm-bored movie.
