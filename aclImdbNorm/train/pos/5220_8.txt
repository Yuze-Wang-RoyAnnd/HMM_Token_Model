i really like richard gere...i always have and it seems as of late that his status as a hollywood star and money maker has slipped but it would appear to me that the reason is that he is taking very mature, intense roles and has been very successful at it just not financially because i have seen him in some truly great gems as of late including the hoax, the hunting party (both must see films! see my reviews) and now this the flock which apparently was meant to be a big release considering it's substantial 35 million + budget. it seems that some of the other imdb reviews are very, very harsh because i thought the film dealt with a potentially very serious social issue in a very direct, violent and disturbing way and gere just brings it all home. it's an action thriller drama that kept my glued to the television with it's story. i think part of the problem that people seem to have with it is that it hollywood-izes a very serious issue but i don't think it does it with disrespect but rather tries to take a different spin to make people aware that this exists. in fact it's much the same way that the hunting party dealt with war. hong kong director wai-keung lau did a decent job holding it together but i think the cast is what made it watchable.<br /><br />richard gere as you may have guessed from my previous comments is brilliant as a social worker of sorts erroll babbage who has kind of created his own style and laws when it comes to keeping track of his "flock" who are registered violent sex offenders. he holds no punches in tracking these people, following them and making absolutely sure they don't re-offend and if they do he'll be the one to identify and stop them any way he can. gere is so intense and looks drained from this job and he's become violent and angry at watching these monsters loose on the street. he is just fantastic. claire danes is also terrific as babbage's new partner and his replacement who he has to train to do his job. danes' character is far more typical social worker and is a little taken aback by babbage's style and methods but slowly realizes what he is trying to accomplish and go up against. the two of them are brilliant together and have terrific chemistry with such vastly different characters. kadee strickland plays a disturbed registered offender who appears to be torn from the headlines as she plays a character very reminiscent of karla homolka (paul bernardo's wife who is now out) for those of you who follow canadian serial killers. her character goes a little over the top but she is convincing and horrifying all at once. russell sams has a small role as strickland's new boyfriend and he would have been better probably given a bigger role. ray wise, who is a terrific character actor (check him out in dead end as well as the amazing turn as satan himself in the wb show reaper) and he gets a small but good role as the head of the public safety department and babbage's boss.<br /><br />the movie isn't perfect despite the terrific performances of it's lead cast. it takes liberties by really trying to make the film more entertainment than educational but it's just a different angle not unlike the nicholas cage dud 8mm. the flock takes you into the underbelly of the sex trade, kidnapping, human trafficking and more and is just really something to watch. perhaps it wasn't directed or written as well as it could have been but i am telling you that danes and gere together make this movie completely watchable and a really great thriller. it's disturbing but also something that isn't very complex and yet gere's character in many ways is intensely complex with many layers and also opens social stigma and makes you contemplate about vigilantism in many ways when you see the people gere deals with. i encourage you all to ignore poor reviews and see it for yourself because it's worth checking out!! 8.5/10
