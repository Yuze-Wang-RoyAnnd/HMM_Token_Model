this movie is incredibly realistic and i feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience. the many people who think they could fathom what goes through a victim's mind are arrogant. as a victim, i feel that dawson did a fantastic job in her role of maya. i agree that this is an incredibly brave film. this looks at rape from a different, more realistic standpoint than any other movie i've ever seen on the subject. the end did drag on a bit long, but i know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, since the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around 1%. it's good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to.
