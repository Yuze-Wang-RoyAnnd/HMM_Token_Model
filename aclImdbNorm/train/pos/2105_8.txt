set in world depression era prague, this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop, who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague. add a little twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -stewart- is having an affair with the owner's wife), leaving stewart briefly 'fired', along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked' stewart all along, the happy ending is inevitable.<br /><br />although very dated (references to poverty and -i have a wife and two kids to consider- are over-used, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, like a musical cigar box, are out-of-reach for common people's enjoyment), this film is much more effective (and more credible) than the 1990s re-make "you've got mail". in the re-make starring tom hanks and meg ryan, the actual odds of the chain-of-events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended.<br /><br />"shop around the corner" is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated, less hectic, and more romantic time and place known as a novelist's utopia. lovers of classic romantic comedies will enjoy this picture!
