yes, this gets the full ten stars. it's plain as day that this fill is genius. the universe sent trent harris a young, wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape, in all that true misfit glory that you just can't fake. too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow's story. the other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story, with sean penn and crispin glover in the roles of the young men, respectively. the world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling, giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america. recommended for anyone and everyone!
