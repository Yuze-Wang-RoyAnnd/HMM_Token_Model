i never seem to write a review on imdb unless i am extremely surprised at how good, or how bad, a movie is. this film falls into the first category. every year, i try to see all the nominees for best foreign film at the oscars, even those that i know i won't like. "as it is in heaven" seems to fit the bill. the plot sounds sugary and sentimental and slow....for my tastes, which run more towards original, dark and/or daring foreign cinema (michael haneke, francois ozon, a lot of modern japanese/korean cinema) "as it is in heaven" does not sound particularly interesting....it didn't get released in the usa, so i sat down to watch a vcd i found in singapore, preparing to "cross it off the list". after a dull beginning, "as it is in heaven" becomes that rare film where you really become inspired by what is happening on screen. weak points: the characters in the film are pure "stock" characters- the wounded dreamer, the town bully, the battered wife, the loose woman yearning for love, the repressed minister....thankfully, they're largely a likable bunch, as well as being well-written and well-acted. ingela olsson, as the minister's wife inger, would have been nominated for an oscar had her performance been in english. strong points: the music is beautiful, and the main song, sung by gabriella, is truly dramatic and memorable. and keep an eye out for the feisty 87-year old actress playing olga, who is keeping up with the dancing steps as well as the younger ladies! i won't discuss the ending, but i will say that it makes sense. they're are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the film, and you're not quite sure why they're happening. although nothing is explained in words, it all makes sense as the movies comes to a fitting crescendo. **** out of *****. probably the strongest swedish movie i've ever seen.
