the good thing about this movie: the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. it also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing. its a small world and this little movie shows us.<br /><br />the bad thing:there are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great movie.<br /><br />its a great movie and many people compare it to magnolia which i haven't seen.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />not rated---i would rate it pg-13 for brief violence,some language and sexual situations.
