when this movie first came out back in 1984, prince was one of the hottest acts around. everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than a extended music video. the acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time? despite that, it was still a very entertaining film! morris day and jerome benton provide some all time classic comedy, especially their rendition of "the password", which will make you think of abbott & costello doing their "who's on first" baseball routine.<br /><br />appolina (who went by a single name then) provided some beautiful breasts, so you had the brief nudity covered. plus, she is very attractive. and of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best prince ever recorded. prince later on had a fallout with warner bros. and changed his name, but at this particular time in his career, he was at the top of his game.<br /><br />this movie doesn't rank in the all time great category, but it is pretty entertaining.
