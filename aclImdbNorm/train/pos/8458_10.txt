gundam wing is an amazing show from start to finish, every single episode is a joy to watch. the story is typical gundam fare, in the future earth's populations grows to the extent where we create space colonies in order to expand. the story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other gundam show. it is the year after colony 195 and the corrupt earth government, known as the earth sphere alliance, is violently taking over the free colonies. to combat the alliance control and the even greater threat that is to come (an evil militaristic organization hiding within the alliance known as oz, which later takes control of earth and the colonies), select members of the colonies send 5 super powerful mechs to earth to try and save the colonies from the threat that is to soon come. these mechs, known as gundams, fight oz and try to regain peace in the colonies as oz takes the front-stage, completely eliminating the alliance and taking control of earth and its colonies.<br /><br />gundam wing as i previously stated, is probably the most enjoyable gundam series to watch in my opinion. a large part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other gundam series before it, but also the stories are far more deep and intricate than majority of the other gundam series. gundam wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other gundam show i have ever seen thus far. this particular series seemed to focus more on character and the relationships amongst those characters than epic space battle. now don't get me wrong, this show still has many epic battles within it, and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere that other gundam series have, but it achieves this by having the story follow an ensemble cast of 6 or 7 characters as opposed to following just 1.<br /><br />no matter how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable gundam series out there, and i strongly recommend it to any fan of anime, or sci-fi in general. the show sports some amazing animation and superb action, but the depth and intricacy of the story is what keeps you coming back for more. the characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them. this show is definitely one that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />a perfect 10/10!
