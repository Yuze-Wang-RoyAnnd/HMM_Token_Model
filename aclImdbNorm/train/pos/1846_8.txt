when i first read the plot of this drama i assumed it was going to be like sex and the city, however this drama is nothing like it. the stories the characters seem more real and you empathise with the situations more. the concept of the drama is similar, four 30 something women guide us through there friendships and relationships with problems and strife along the way. katie the gp is a dark and brooding character who you find difficult to relate too and is best friends with trudi a widow. trudi's character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four. jessica is the party girl very single minded and knows what she wants and how to get it. she is a likable character and is closest to siobhan the newly wed who whilst loving her husband completely can't help her eyes wandering to her work colleague. over all the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the bbc continue to produce the series it could do well. it is unlike other female cast dramas such as sex and the city, or desperate housewives. this if played right could be the next cold feet. plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too.
