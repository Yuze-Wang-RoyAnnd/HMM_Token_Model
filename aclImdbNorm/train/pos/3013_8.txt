talented detective mr. philo vance (william powell) cancels his overseas trip to investigate an apparently cut and dried case of suicide he has good reason to suspect is really something much more, a rather deliciously complex murder! <br /><br />as far as murder mystery films go, it just doesn't get any better than this one. populated with suspicious characters, all connected to a dog show and all having very good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim archer coe, it's truly tough to figure this one out or wrap one's head around it but boy, does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us. even the cops, the coroner and the district attorney prove colorful, fleshed out characters adding a level of unexpected gritty realism to this one's proceedings and amping up its overall "fun" factor. i particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner (played by etienne girardot), who is always it seems to him being rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one's running time. also eugene palette's detective sgt. heath provides welcome, often later delightfully humorous at his expense, critical commentary during vance's investigation. i cannot think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact except perhaps that it hasn't dated particularly well. doesn't stop the movie from being just plain good fun viewing though. watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one's mystery. highly recommended you try!
