it was released in france on dvd several years ago--i wish it would be re-released with english subtitles. do not confuse this with a remake with penelope cruz which gets poor reviews. gerard phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. he sets off to join the army and goes to war. his love, however, is gina lollabrigida in an early movie for her. i won't spoil the end. gerard phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss to moviedom.
