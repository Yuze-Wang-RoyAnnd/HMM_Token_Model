i was not expecting much from this movie. i was given a ticket for an advanced screening. i had just gotten off of work. it was hot and i was tired. i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex.<br /><br />once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie, getting more and more excited with each minute passing. i think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic. the actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical.
