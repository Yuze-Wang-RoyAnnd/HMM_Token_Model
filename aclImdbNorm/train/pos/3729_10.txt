while i suppose this film could get the rap as being anti-vietnam, while watching it i didn't feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public didn't support.... it showed their fear, their desperation, their drive... all of it, out in the open, naked. as a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military - especially boot camp. on the whole this movie, although it was shot on a very small budget, looks great, is very well put together, and features excellent acting and directing. i highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent colin farrell film. 10/10
