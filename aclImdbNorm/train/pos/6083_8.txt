brian dennehy, bill paxton, joe pantalino and, best of all, jeff fahey, all in one film. wow is all i can think to say about that. these are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and they work beautifully together. it's like poetry the way they play off each other and ooze the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for eons for even shooting the film.<br /><br />the film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time, and the four stars help the re-watch-ability to a great extent. i cannot describe how good it was to see bill paxton and jeff fahey together on screen, the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves, it almost brought a tear to my eyes.<br /><br />a good film, a great cast, go see. why? four words, fahey, dennehy, paxton, pantalino.
