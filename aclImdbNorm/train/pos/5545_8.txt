**** includes spoilers ****<br /><br />i've been a horror film fan now for many decades. just when i think i've seen all the great ones another pops up to surprise me. i had never seen this film before. it was a treat, off the beaten path too...not just the path to the swamp ferry boat either. here was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different. the pretty girl is (gulp) fearless for a change and saves the men, including the man she loves, from the monster ! how is that for a twist. this girl was the complete opposite of most women in films of that time, no screaming at her own shadow, no fainting from fright, no tripping over a leaf as she runs. this gal wasn't afraid to live alone in a secluded hut far away from the rest of the villagers. not only that but the place was on a foggy swamp rumored to be haunted. heck she even takes naps on the swamp grass outdoors...like a regular 1940s version of ripley. no snake, gator or ghostly strangler would dare bother this gal. books on early feminist films should be sure to include this overlooked work.<br /><br />see this if you are a fan, like me, of those wonderfully atmospheric classic b/w horror films they made only in the 30s and 40s. and be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection.
