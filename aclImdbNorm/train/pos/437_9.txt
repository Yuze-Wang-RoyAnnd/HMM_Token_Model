enchanted april is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. it has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. i continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the film to come out in dvd format. apparently, i am not alone.<br /><br />if parent company amazon's listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in dvd format. many people want to go to italy with this cast and this script. many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. the cast is spectacular, the cinematography and direction impeccable. the film is a definite keeper. many have already asked. please add our names to the list.
