a realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me. it has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two. we rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older, non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults.<br /><br />this movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love. in the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse. typical plot some may say, but this really was unexpected. <br /><br />i found myself rooting for the survival of the couple's relationship, seeing my own past in their story. moments of deep thought and revelation came pouring out of the actors performances. <br /><br />it's a bright film that i would endorse for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love. great movie. i'll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection.
