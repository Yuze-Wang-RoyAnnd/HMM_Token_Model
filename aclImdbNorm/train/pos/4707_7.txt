"johnny dangerously" is a sort of hit and miss comedy that has it's laughs and "huh?". but i suggest to give it a chance. i think it is greatly over looked. not too many people give this movie a chance. it does work. just think of it as a little parody of "goodfellas". michael keaton is very funny in his role. and he does it well. johnny dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. he just works his way up from the big bosses to a beautiful wife. and of course like a lot of the mob movies, someone wants him dead. 90% of the jokes get a laugh. like, i said give it a chance. just take your favortie gangster movies and mix a comedy in. you have "johnny dangerously". <br /><br />7/10
