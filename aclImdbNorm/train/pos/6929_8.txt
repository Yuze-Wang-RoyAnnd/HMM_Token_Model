saw this flick on encw last nite for the third or fourth time. enjoyed it so much i ordered the dvd. this really is a standout and of course the first of the mann-stewart pairings. more here than the usual oater, although not quite as powerful as the searchers. lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly it's the acting by stewart, his partner millard mitchell, shelly winters and the waco johnny dean- dan duryea. steve miller (not the joker) is interesting as a handsome would be hero who's interested in lola but too yellow . like stewart in the man who killed liberty valance, he's practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving his enemies coffee. decaf no doubt. tony curtis from the bronx cavalry and rock hudson behaving like no indian i've seen on screen have interesting cameos.<br /><br />special performances by john mcintire as a too lucky card dealing/gun trader who hangs out at a very low grade western version of rick's american cafe. nobody wants to spend the night there. jay c. flippens out over a kiss from lola (winters) and has some nice scenes with stewart before he gets to bend of the river and far country. will geer as wyatt earp and the indian chief who takes walter brennan's teeth from him in red river are pleasant sightings. this is the kind of western that only stewart, not wayne nor scott could have pulled off. worth the shot, i repeat. :-)
