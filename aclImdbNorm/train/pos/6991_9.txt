this is an excellent movie. the cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent. the movie is basically about a well-accomplished doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and taking them to his home. once the bodies are at his home, he removes stuff (i hate to use such a general term, but i forget what it was he removed) and puts it into his wife to retain her youth. then a reporter, patricia hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers on why the brides were dying. she takes a trip to the doctors house and the interesting things begin to take place. definitely watch this oldie, but goodie if you can.
