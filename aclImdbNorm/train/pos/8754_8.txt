i watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend. i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i didn't feel very good.<br /><br />i ended up liking it big time. it's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug traffic, and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail.<br /><br />the acting is on it's prime level. two of the women that i lust the most star and that's a good thing. claire danes is as cute and charming as always while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance. bill pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities.<br /><br />there are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience. plus it shows the difficult times at thailand.<br /><br />this is an underrated movie. not many films like this one have come up in recent history. it should make you reflex about many things...
