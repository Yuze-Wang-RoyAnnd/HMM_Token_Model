this is a very fine and poetic story. beautiful scenery. magnificent music score. i've been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling. the movement of the camera is superb, as well as the actors. it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it's all very well brought onto the screen here. the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. once you've seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director. it's a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody.
