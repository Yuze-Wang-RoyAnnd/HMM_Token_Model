if you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the american league pennant race satisfying. on the other hand, if you are hanging around waiting for kill bill volume 3 or sin city 2 then you probably should stay away. the plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl's friends, girl meets guy's friends, and guy meets girl's parents scenes. there is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene. that's all par for the course in a movie like this. however, what i liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky. the plot centers around answering the questions; how much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those quirks? it is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down (if we admit it) we all have quirks. barrymore does a very good job in her role and fallon sorta surprised me -- he's good as well. i rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one. add another point if you are a red sox fan and subtract two points if you are a yankees fan.
