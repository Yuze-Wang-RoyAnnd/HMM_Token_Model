it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance. i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing. if you loved bulgakov's book you would be, understandably, afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the story's deeper meaning to the screen. there are a couple examples of this with the master and margarita. as complex and far-fetched as the story is, the movie leaves out nothing. it is as if the filmmaker read bulgakov's work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score--with not a note missed. why can't we find such talent here in the u.s. ? so now my favorite book and movie have the same title.
