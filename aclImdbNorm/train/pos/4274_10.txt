i like this movie a lot, but it's a fact, that you cannot understand it, unless you're from the ex yugoslavia. most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex yugoslavia. i appreciate that this movie is now on divx and i can have it in my collection. macedonia. serbia. montenegro. bosnia and herzegowina. croatia. slovenia.<br /><br />all of this was ex yugoslavia, a melting pot of the balcan nations. it could be a dream land, if slobodan milosevic, franjo tudjman and other nationalists wouldn't poison the nation's mind with their sick ideas.
