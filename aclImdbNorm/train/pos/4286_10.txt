i saw this film (it's english title is "who's singing over there?") at the 1980 montreal international film festival. it won raves then... and disappeared. a terrible shame. it is brilliant. sublime, ridiculous, sad, and extremely funny. the script is a work of art. it's been 19 years and i've seen only a handful of comedies (or any other genre, for that matter) that can match its originality.
