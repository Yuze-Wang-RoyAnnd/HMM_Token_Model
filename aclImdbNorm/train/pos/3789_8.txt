bravo to czechs, their once-powerful movie industry seems to awaken from post-communist slumber.<br /><br />the loners is a comedy done with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern "hollywood" production minus the garbage that seems to get attached to the genre over the past several years. superb soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful prague cityscape, to mention but a few.<br /><br />the story is actually comprised of several sub-stories that frequently intertwain and overlap, an is in essence a collage of destinies, fates, desires... it follows a group of urban youth-to-mid-thirties people through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions. and it is hillarious. there's actually a point in the movie where the entire theatre i was in (about a 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed non-stop for about 40-50 seconds. how often do you experience that with modern hollywood productions?<br /><br />although the entire main cast is excellent (especially the upcoming macedonian star labina mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing the all-too-familiar hardships) i have to single out jiri machacek for his superbly believeable portrayal of jakub, a constantly stoned bohemian whose brain is severely affected by the stuff he smokes landing him in a plethora of funny situations.<br /><br />conclusion: don't miss this one! it's got a lot to offer.
