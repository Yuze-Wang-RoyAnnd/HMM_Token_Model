first of all, this film was not released to theatres (tested poorly they say),i say they figured the story of crooked cops, politicians & dedicated newspaper people had been done to death,just send it dvd & cable tv> & take the money & run.<br /><br />that being said i usually like this type of movie, especially with this named cast. morgan freeman, justin timberlake, kevin spacey,<br /><br />l.l.cool j, cary elways, john heard & on the distaff side, piper perabo & roslyn sanchez.<br /><br />the plot & story have been done to death, but the above cast brings life to this violent movie & it is actually watchable.<br /><br />justin timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw-away newspaper edited by morgan freeman, the others are either crooked cops,& politicians or somewhat decent guys, the 2 ladies are the girl friends of ll cool j & justin timberlake & do whats required, it is quite violent, many killings etc, not for children. by no means is the a great film, but for what it is & the cast it is definitely good,<br /><br />ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) imdb 8 (out of 10)
