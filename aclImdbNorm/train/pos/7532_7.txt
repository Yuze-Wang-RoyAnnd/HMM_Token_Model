the new batman adventures (also called gotham knights) takes place 5 years after the final episodes of batman: the animated series (b:tas) and only aired for 24 episodes. this isn't a horrible show, but it just isn't as good as the original batman animated series. i'll start with all the things that i found not to be very good.<br /><br />first thing's first, the animation itself: long and sweet, gotham isn't dark anymore, the sky is always bright red and orange, b:tas did this also, but it was drawn on a dark palate, do the colour of the sky was more ominous, in this show, the colour of the sky is too bright. it all just looks like any other kids show and doesn't seem unique like batman: tas did with it's dark, cool art style on gotham. the art style is ok, but doesn't remind me of batman anymore. every character is comprised of straight lines, squares, and triangles making characters look less human-like. in the original series (b:tas), characters look more like drawn versions of real people. the animation may be more consistent here than in b:tas, but it definitely isn't as good. <br /><br />next: some of the episodes seem too dumbed down and childish, but some of the subject matter is even stronger than in b:tas.(two-face attempting to kill tim drake/robin 2, and some villains get some pretty harsh treatment). this leads me to my next point.<br /><br />because this is supposed to take place in the future as well as the final episodes of the batman animated universe, many villains do meet their demise or leave forever. poison ivy apparently drowns when a cruise ship explodes; two-face nearly kills penguin, killer croc, and himself, so he's moved to arkham forever; joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant (though he will return later on the justice league animated series); catwoman moves away to france leaving batman, etc... just because the series is ending does not mean that they have to get rid of some great characters! the villains' motives are pretty bad, too. there are none! in b:tas, we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined, that's why they act the way they do, in this show, the villains are just committing crimes to progress the story. it's like batman just doesn't even care about saving whatever sanity there is left in the people that he fights, he just beats them senseless. this batman is a colder and meaner version of the character, but since he's been doing this job for years, i can see why he is so harsh. <br /><br />next, the redesigned character models: they're awful. gordon slimmed down about 100 pounds... is he sick? many villains look stupid (joker, riddler, catwoman, mr. freeze, mad hatter, and killer croc are among the worst). although, i do think that some characters look better (bane, scarecrow, batgirl). harley is about the same, and ivy (who is even hotter now) has pale green skin.<br /><br />with the series having many faults, some episodes are great- over the edge, mad love, beware the creeper, girls night out, old wounds, legends of the dark knight, and never fear are my favourite ones here, in my opinion. all of the crossovers featuring batman in the superman animated series were great, also.<br /><br />the absolute worst part about this show is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original. on the dvd features of the original batman animated series, they talk about how proud they were with the art style, and how difficult some characters were to animate, but they did eventually succeed with (the difficult animation necessary to animate clayface, for example). on the dvd features of the new batman adventures, the creators basically say "to hell with b:tas, this is a fresh, new re-vamp, it looks better and we love how we nearly ruined the series!" (alright, that is an exaggeration). when the creators cast away the amazing art style of b:tas, that really annoyed me!<br /><br />it's not a bad show, but i still don't like it as much as the original animated series. at least the show doesn't talk down to its audience, so for that reason, i still commend it. though some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching. <br /><br />superman: the animated series, and justice league: the animated series are great follow-up shows to batman: the animated series and the new batman adventures, so give them a watch as well.
