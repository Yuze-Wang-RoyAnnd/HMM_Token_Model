somebody mastered the difficult task of merging sports with romance. in reality, sports and romance go together like oil and water. so, to successfully put the two together on screen... well, that is about the equivalent of splitting the atom. i never thought it could be done. i will be the first to say that in general i don't like romantic comedies... but i do like sports and most movies about sports. this movie was a pretty good mix of the two. being a baseball fan, i could really appreciate the comedic ordeal with ben wrightman (jimmy falon) being a rabid boston redsox fan. anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the babe that plagued the redsox for 86 years, and they know just how nuts about baseball a lot of redsox fans are. the farrely brothers did a great job capturing that and it made for good comedy. this was a very good movie that could appeal to many.
