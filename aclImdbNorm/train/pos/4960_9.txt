this movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season. it celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness. morgan freeman plays a character very like freeman himself--a successful actor pushing 70. he has traveled to a small, rather grimy grocery store intending to research a part he might play, as a manager of such a place. he soon beguiles the staff and the customers, especially the lovely, if cranky, young woman (paz vega) who presides over the "10 items or less" checkout lane.<br /><br />10 items or less doesn't have a big statement to make and doesn't pretend that it does. it follows freeman and vega as they become friendly, and as the older man offers his counsel, in exchange for a ride home--the movie-company gofer who is supposed to pick him up never shows and freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he can't call for help. i had a little case of the blues on a gray sunday afternoon in new york city and this flick cured what ailed me.
