five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas, but it features some of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences in hong kong film history. director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece. this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms. meng lo plays yet another bad ass. he would go on to be in super ninjas. kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled. any chop socky fan can apperciate this. but i still think it ain't as good as super ninjas (also made by chang cheh). but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best.
