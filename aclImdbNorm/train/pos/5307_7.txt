"pecker" is a young, unknown photographer from baltimore who becomes a big star in the public, the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the dirty reality of all-day life just as dirty underwear or human excrements. it's a typical topic of john waters baltimore-based independent comedies to show the weird sides of the american way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative backlashes by exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown.<br /><br />edward furlong of "terminator 2" fame plays pecker, supported by christina ricchi, photographer cindy sherman, legendary patricia hearst and water's long-time actress mink stole. although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and can't compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of water's brilliant "serial mom", it's still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie-girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable dish... "pecker" is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, media hypes, middle-class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it. recommended!
