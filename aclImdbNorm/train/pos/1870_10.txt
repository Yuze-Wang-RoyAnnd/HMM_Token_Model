this movie is great! it touched my stone cold heart. i couldn't relate about the racial discrimination that antwone has experienced because i'm living in my own country. i guess it is really hard to be discriminated.<br /><br />we watched this film in our sociology class in new era university,and i didn't knew that it was a true story, i thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry. it is very good.<br /><br />the part that shocked me was when nadine abused antwone (who was just six) sexually. if i were on his shoes, i could have jumped a ten-story high building. i salute him for he being so strong!<br /><br />the scene that touched me here is when antwone finally saw his mother eva face to face. he did not bitched her or whatever,instead he told her about the achievements that he got within the long years that they have been separated. (i think i'll do that when i get the chance of tracing my roots.)
