"cry freedom" is not just a movie. it is a historical account, heroic story, and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history. not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating, determined hero, steve biko, but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south arfrican apartheid. the story of biko, an influential leader, and his main "influencee", donald woods, is a heartbreaking one. but, the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa. "cry freedom" manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. it is because of great films like this one, that the public can become educated on terrible events in history, great leaders who sought to end them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. because of this importance, "cry freedom" is an amazing film that should be seen by all.
