...in our household. like everyone else who has commented on this movie, my brothers (7 & 4 years old at the time) and i (10) would watch this movie over and over again. we all loved star wars, but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure. we all loved the camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song. there are some slow moments (the time spent with king koo-koo in his court) and we generally got bored after the knight's song ("the reason that i {sound effect} is because i loooooove you"), but we loved the journey to rescue babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of king koo-koo floating there dominating the entire horizon, laughing maniacally at the end. i still to this day sing "hooray for me! babbette of gay paris!" around my friends (i'm 33 now) who just look at me as if i've lost my mind; however, when i'm singing it i'm 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of star wars.
