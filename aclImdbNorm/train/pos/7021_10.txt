i had the pleasure of attending a screening of the pacific and eddy last weekend at the santa barbara international film festival. this film had caught my attention a little while back when i stumbled across an article about it in jalouse magazine. seemed interesting at the time, but nothing too exciting. anyhow, i saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out. all i can say is that i was speechless when the ending credits began to roll. this is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films that i have seen in some time. the photography, art direction, acting, and especially directing, were seamless and impeccable. nothing is 'spelled out' for you in this film and actually makes you think. something that a vast majority of films today do the exact opposite. the dialogue is carefully crafted and, although this script is not wall to wall chatter, the characters words are very deliberate and meaningful.<br /><br />it's definitely one of those films that deserves a second viewing and the more you see it, the more things you notice. it's a very layered and intelligent film. not sure when or where it's playing again, but a definite must see for film enthusiasts.
