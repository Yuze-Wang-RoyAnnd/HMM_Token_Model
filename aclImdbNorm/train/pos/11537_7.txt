neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple--a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment.<br /><br />lemmon is neatnik felix ungar, bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison (matthau) with somewhat disastrous results. seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other's ways, with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact opposite.<br /><br />funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date. the priceless interaction between lemmon, matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches. the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters (a pair of geese) in disney's the aristocats, and here--their comic timing on top of lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity--where it remains much of the time.<br /><br />if you're a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work, this one is not to be missed. matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast (even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began) and, of course, it's easy to see why it became a top-rated tv show later on.<br /><br />summing up: top simon comedy, not to be missed.
