i loved kolchak: the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september 13, 1974. i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle (hey, where's the soundtrack guys?) and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple, important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level. when darren mcgavin's carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations, he reacts like most people would. he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger, he is frightened, even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode. it's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force. he's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works. sometimes, he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are. in one episode, he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it, he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly, he must go back and defend himself. he's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him. he's a regular guy, doing a job, trying to make a buck, not a monster-hunter. he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural, which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do. if his plan to defeat the creature didn't work, you will often see him running for his life to get away from it, which is of course what i would do in the situation. that's why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid. kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him. you were scared for him and for the other characters too. the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit, scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it's all for naught if you don't care about the characters. darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a "monster of the week" show and he decided not to continue. i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but, as an adult, i can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long. i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling, determined and brusk but good-hearted reporter for the ins, known as carl kolchak. i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show. it's not the monsters, darkly-lit sets, creepy music or goofy guest stars, although they are all vital ingredients. the secret to it's success is right there in the title - "kolchak: the night stalker". without mcgavin's lovable, bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for, then it just ain't a night stalker.
