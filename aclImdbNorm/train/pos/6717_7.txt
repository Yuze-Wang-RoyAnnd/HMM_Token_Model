this documentary was very thorough and exposing, and at the same time entertaining, which i thought was rather impressive. i felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its' origin until present day, but nonetheless, there is a reason why i do not give such a high score to this film...<br /><br />i felt as if at times the story focused too much on the 'proper nouns' of the sport, so to speak: too much on individual locations at which to surf, and especially too much on individual surfers. i felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, the ideology of the sport, etc. it would have been better (although this of course was covered, i do not think it got as much time as it warranted). <br /><br />and for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing, at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring. although the video clips and the in-depth research is well-respected, it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers.<br /><br />furthermore, my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how utterly amazing and miraculous certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding, and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing, breath-taking event that these men are talking about as life-changing moments, and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about it, and not the actual footage. it was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories, and then be unable to see them. i understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of everything, but please: do not brag an event up so much, and then not show it. <br /><br />overall, a very fresh documentary that i enjoyed watching; not the best documentary due to the above reasons, but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack, it is a documentary that i would advise everybody to check out.
