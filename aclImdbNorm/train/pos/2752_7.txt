though the plot elements to "the eighth day" seem like they have been done plenty of times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that jaco van dormal's first film had. though not as good as "toto the hero", which will always remain on my favorites list, the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. daniel auteil, from 2001's flavorless "the closet" downplays his part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic). however, i felt the part needed a bit more realism to it, focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character's growth.<br /><br />don't walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from "toto the hero" because you will be disappointed. however, the film still serves as a decent, if not flawed, movie
