how powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be. this film tells it's tale with everyday scenes that manage to revel the poignancy hidden within. it's true as others have stated, how this film really makes it glaringly obvious how lost hollywood is in it's special effects, overblown emotionalism and over the top climatic endings and have forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism. so much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in wordy dialogue. one aspect that i really enjoyed about the film was the contrast of the two brothers, one so very openly expressive in his childlike way and the other completely stoic but both able to evoke deep emotion. the older brother needed to say little, as he usually did, it was all there in that deadpan face of his! beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, great direction! not to be missed!
