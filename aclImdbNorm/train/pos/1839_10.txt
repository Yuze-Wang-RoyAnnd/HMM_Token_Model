an excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman. one of the cop (p'erier) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (montand). the unlucky montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her, and p'erier doesnt know either that montand had an affair with the girl. montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a great ending! highly recommended.
