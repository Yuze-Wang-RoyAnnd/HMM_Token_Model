richard widmark is a tainted character in this movie. he is a professional pickpocket. he's been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four. thelma ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody. jean peters is amazing as the girl flamed by widmark.<br /><br />this is a period piece during the mccarthy era where the red scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely. what is unusual about this film is that peters & ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films. this is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film.<br /><br />the film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by fox as the under card for double features in the theater. the sets show it is a limited budget film. the script made j edgar hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift. hoover wanted it changed.<br /><br />instead, it became a b under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953. the script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year.
