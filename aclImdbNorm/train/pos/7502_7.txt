though i really didn't feel anything for lance's character, and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else. it could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development, perhaps with lance- i would have liked it better.<br /><br />however, i have to completely agree with doyleluver, when they said "and to quote glenn quinn's character ben: 'i'm the star here in it, that's right i'm the talented one!'" if you watch the movie, just watch him, even when he's in the background... just his facial expressions, all in the eyes, you know for sure what motivates ben, exactly how he feels about comments, even if it's a quick look behind a character's back. great acting in a fair film.
