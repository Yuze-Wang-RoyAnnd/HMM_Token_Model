pegg has had a few hits in the past few years, starting with "shaun of the dead" in 2004, movie on to "hot fuzz 2007", early 2008 he came out with "run fat boy run" and now comes this, "how to lose friends and alienate people" which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy's of the year.<br /><br />the film is about sidney yound, a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity's mostly because he is not one of them. anyway, one of the most successful magazine owners (played by jeff bridges) invites him (out of nostalgia) to work at his magazine. sidney is of course excited and moves to america, there he meets a girl currently writing a book, and hilarity ensues.<br /><br />this film is great and i hope more come out like it in the near future. pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and i cant wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy "paul". i rate this film 81%.
