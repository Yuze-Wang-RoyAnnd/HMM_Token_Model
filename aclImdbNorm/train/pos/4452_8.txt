don't be swayed by the naysayers. this is a wonderfully spooky film. this was a thesis project for the writer/director , jt petty. he did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat. i never really knew what to expect, and for a jaded horror-movie goer, this is nirvana! the film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods. one day, while searching for his cat in the woods, he witnesses the murder of a child, or does he? he agonizes about this the rest of the film. what is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes. i found this to be intriguing. the writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug. give this film a go, you won't be disappointed.
