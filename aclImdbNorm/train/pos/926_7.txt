i don't know why some people criticise that show so much.<br /><br />it is a great, funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time, but still...<br /><br />the family dynamics are funny, and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows. the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried & roy jibes are only just above average, but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing.<br /><br />this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for it.<br /><br />rating: 8/10
