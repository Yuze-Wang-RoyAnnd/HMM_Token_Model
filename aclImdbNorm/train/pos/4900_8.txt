this is a quirky movie that the brits do so well. low budget, cameo type roles, well executed. the story is a little weak, a recently widowed judi dench decides to round up the "blonde bombshells' a all (well almost all) girl band who performed during the war in london. the obligatory son/daughter who thinks she's gone potty. i did like the way the movie lets young people see that they don't have a monopoly on feelings, love and even lust! that the "old wrinklies" can have a good laugh too. judi dench was superb as always, a pity we didn't get to see more of the other "blonde bombeshells, the end was a little rushed i thought. i kept thinking as i watched that david jason would have made an even better patrick than ian holm, although he was quite adequate as the "transvestite" drummer. all in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls :)
