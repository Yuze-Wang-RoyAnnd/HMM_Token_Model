if the lion king is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death, the lion king 1 and a half is the total opposite, full of whimsy and cheer. the lion king told the story from the side of simba the young lion, 1 and a half is from the view of timone and pumbaa, a less than perfect duo made up of a meercat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and a warthog who has an odor issue. the movie is a little short on substance, but disney does a good job of filling time with various sketches starring timone and pumbaa as they "watch" the movie with us. my favorite is the sing-along that happens halfway through the movie, make sure you watch the bouncing bug! disney has advertised 1 and a half as "the rest of the story," though it really isn't. it is just a different perspective of the lion king, without all of the serious stuff that pervaded most of the second half of the original disney classic. credit nathan lane as timone and ernie sabella as pumbaa for their voice work, without their efforts, the movie may not have worked. the sing, they entertain, and they make us laugh. they also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog.
