i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international film festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this as my #3 film. i had an initial interest in seeing this being of swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the norrland region of sweden where this was filmed. also i grew up in an area of rural north woods america where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. it's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like sa som i himmelen. this was a very good film and i'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it's large ensemble cast but director kay pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing. helen sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and i would look forward to more of her on the big screen. i enjoyed michael nyqvist in the lead of this well-rounded cast. i would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.
