i saw this film when i was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parent's basement on a saturday night. it was being shown on "chiller theatre," a regular fright feature that i watched religiously as a young 'un. now, i have seen many old horror films thanks to chiller theatre, but none ever stuck with me like "danse macabre," a.k.a. "castle of blood." i am 51 now, and only last year was i fortunate enough to locate a relatively recent, quality dvd edition of this wonderfully shudder-inducing supernatural classic, having thought i'd never manage to see it again. i have already watched it four more times, and cannot seem to get tired of it.<br /><br />they just don't make spook films like this one anymore. haunted catacombs and mist-enshrouded graveyards just don't work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day. anyway, this one has edgar allen poe and barbara steele, deliciously shadowy, cobweb-wrap'ed haunted castle sets, restless spirits re-enacting their deaths... and a wickedly ironic ending.<br /><br />imo, this one's right up there with robert wise's "the haunting," "the innocents" (with deborah kerr), and the more recent "the others."
