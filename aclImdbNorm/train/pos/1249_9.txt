i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod. if you don't expect anything else, such as clever plot twists and believable character development, you won't be disappointed. consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people, especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy' (suzanna arquette, who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten - she leaves that up to her daughter).<br /><br />mandy's face is a little too perfect, but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire, up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness, a perfect 7-to-10 ratio of waist to hips, and splendidly configured legs, right down to her feet. (there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio).<br /><br />and no flat butt to boot, which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres'. mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded german-guy victim no. 2, but from all i could see from her bikini shots, she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it.<br /><br />mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl', with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones. her bisexual nature (allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no. 2, who also happened to be her mother's lover) added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses (always by water with the men - the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason).<br /><br />mandy's uber-nordic facial features coupled with her uber-voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse. if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress, i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages, especially italian and spanish - and maybe french, although i don't know if they would go for her type. but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too nordic, and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground.<br /><br />vambo drule.
