a very promising directorial debut for bill paxton. a very dark thriller/who-really-done-it recommended by stephen king. this is a strong, well-conceived horror tale about a devout, but demented man in thurman, texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from god to eliminate demons trying to control mankind. a couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth. most of the violence you don't really see, but still enough to double up your stomach.<br /><br />director paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the hand of god killer. matthew mcconaughey is equally impressive as the demented man's eldest son that ends up telling this story to a dallas fbi agent(powers boothe). boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. suspenseful white knuckler! highly recommended.
