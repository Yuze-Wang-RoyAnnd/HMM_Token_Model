overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come. although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book most everything is correct. the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts. i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie (because i hadn't found out about the movie yet) but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal-mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected. overall i give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and overall making sense) and for its bad parts (large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies).
