when you see the cover of the dvd you're convinced this is some class b cheesy cheapie, a film made for $1,000 in somebody's backyard.<br /><br />wrong! <br /><br />this is quality material and really good. it's a comedy and a clever one at that. it also is very touching in spots, with a nice spot of kindness. the production values are very good (this looks excellent), the actors are known, the film's direction and sets are great. it's amazing. who would have thought?<br /><br />carrie-ann moss, playing against-type, is terrific, as"helen robinson," the june cleaver-like wife; billy connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie "fido;" tim blake nelson ("mr. theopolis") is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend "tammy," and henry czerny and dylan baker as dads (check) are excellent, too k'sun ray as young "timmy robinson," shouldn't be overlooked, either. in fact, he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone.<br /><br />if i explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. you'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very, very pleasant surprise. you need a dark sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the absurd.
