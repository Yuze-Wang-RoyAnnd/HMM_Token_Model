my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this film very much. the viewer is swept away from modern life into old japan, while at the same time exposed to very current themes. the characters are realistic and detailed; it has an unpredictable ending and story, which is very refreshing. the story is made up of mini-plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district. i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old japan.<br /><br />
