interesting, fast-paced and amusing.<br /><br />i'm not one of those people who watches loads and loads of television. i stumbled across this show while home sick with a bad case of the flu one day, and was immediately hooked. i developed quite a crush on john burke. both he and claire did an amazing job of hosting the show together. you could really tell that they both loved their jobs.<br /><br />the super-collector segments were excellent. i found myself interested in things i had never previously given a single thought to.<br /><br />what i would really like to know is: whatever happened to jack the dog? did one of the hosts adopt him?
