one of the best "amitabh comeback" movies i liked. this was the phase when govinda was going strong with dhawan. the songs were awesome and totally as we call it "masti" type. an evergreen entertainer with the likes of the multifaceted anupam kher chipping in. the story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for david dhawan's potboilers. with a timely appearance by mrs.madhuri "nene" dixit, it was a total riot towards the end. it was great to see amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile. although some may consider it a typical "bollywood masala" movie, i would watch it any day. i am giving it an easy 8 out of 10 just for being pure bollywood.
