suraj barjatya is best in movies on marriage. and here he is; back to his basics on vivaah. as the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage. a movie you can watch with your entire family around you. a movie you will hate watching alone. the story is simple, but the music is good, cinematography is excellent, direction is best, everything about the movie has a class of its own. there are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart, you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the movie.<br /><br />shahid & amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like ishq vishq, & shikhar. though shikhar was a good movie it wasn't accepted well by the public.a truly shahid & amrita film.
