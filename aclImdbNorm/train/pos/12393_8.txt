for those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be encased in big red pods that make me crave pomegranate, there is the duo of the "second renaissance" shorts. i'm not exactly sure why they are split into two parts, especially since they're credited as one on the dvd (and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the dvd?), but they're informative even if they have a few gaps.<br /><br />what really makes this first part stand out, from the second part and the rest of the animations as well, is the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights. graphic homages to slavery, fascism, concentration camps, and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the million man march and humanity's god-complex. in fact, "god" is never really referenced by these shorts, instead replaced by "man's own image".<br /><br />as far as the shorts go in the collection, "the second renaissance: part i" is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion. it's a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become "the architect of its own destruction." some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature, but then again, that's basically what most of the matrix series has done, and it's been a driving force behind its success.<br /><br />--polarisdib
