if any show in the last ten years deserves a 10, it is this rare gem. it allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun. filled with heart and laughs, this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference. the furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful, and the even the drugs were tolerable. the hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by roller-skates, and in the words of merle haggard, "a joint was a bad place to be". take a trip back to the greatest time in american history. fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were nicer to each other. this classic is on television as much as "full house". don't miss it, and always remember to "shake your groove thing!!!"
