i love this movie like no other. another time i will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated, but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue, which, please remember, is all tongue in cheek. aussies and poms will understand, everyone else-well?<br /><br />(title song lyric)"he can sink a beer, he can pick a queer, in his latest double-breasted bondi gear."<br /><br />(another song lyric) "all pommies are bastards, bastards, or worse, and england is the a**e-hole of the universe."<br /><br />(during a television interview on an "arty program"): mr mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you've been in england? (barry's response)flamin' bull-artists!<br /><br />(while chatting up a naive young pom girl): mr mackenzie, i suppose you have hordes of aboriginal servants back in australia? (barry's response) abos? i've never seen an abo in me life. mum does most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) round our place.<br /><br />this is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser aussie flick. if you can get a copy of it, watch and enjoy.
