well, what can i say having just watched this fantastic film, when my nerves are still jangling! jacques audiard the director must be making quite a name for himself in france, and rightly so. vince cassel is no tom cruise and emmanuelle devos is no penelope cruz either, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a taut and compelling thriller which starts off slowly with some clever character building and then starts to put tension on tension to a wonderful climax. others have written about the plot, so i will not say more than everyone in this film plays their role to perfection, the director, the actors, right down to the cameraman, and everything seems so real, no stupid gun play, the fighting when it happens is so credible, the expressions, the emotions, it is almost as you are there as a spectator. do yourself a favour, get the dvd, a bottle of wine, turn the lights low, take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this hitchcockian thriller :)
