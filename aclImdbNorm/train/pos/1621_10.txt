harman and isings 'old mill pond' is a true masterpiece of the art of animation. the consummate skill and artistry that characterise this duos work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon. it is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is, and was always intended to be, a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people. if anything it is a tribute to the infectious humour and musicality of the black race. i have not been able to view this confection for many years as the 'race commissars' in england have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multi racial britain. if anyone knows where i can obtain a copy i would dearly love to view this masterpiece again. i think those who routinely look for messages and intent that were never intended in these cartoons, which are, after all, sixty years old, should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today, but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what is viewable from the past.
