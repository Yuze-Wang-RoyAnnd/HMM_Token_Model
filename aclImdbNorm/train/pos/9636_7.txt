a lonely depressed french boy mathieu (jeremie elkaim) on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with cedric (the gorgeous stephane rideau). quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie. on one hand, i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys. on the other i was getting annoyed--the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason. it's very confusing and pointless. <br /><br />spoilers ahead!!!<br /><br />also there are tons of plot holes--mathieu, at one point, does something that ends him up in the hospital. what is it--we're never told! then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else he's living with him. why? we're not told. then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end. why? no explanation. it's clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so... however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much. if only things were explained!<br /><br />elkaim as mathieu is not good. he's tall, handsome and has a nice body--but he can't act. his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face--all the time. rideau, on the other hand, is great. he's very handsome, has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor. also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. there is full frontal male nudity, lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great--most movies shy away from showing male-male love scenes. this one doesn't and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other.<br /><br />so, a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing--especially for rideau's nude scenes--that is, if you like good-looking nude young men!<br /><br />
