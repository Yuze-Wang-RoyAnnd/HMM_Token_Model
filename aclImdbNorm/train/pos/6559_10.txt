the gang of roses. "every rose has its thorns."<br /><br />a mix of old western and hip hop, blended perfectly together. the clothing styles, the scenery, and the plot are all suited to what the director wanted. <br /><br />plot - in five years, they robbed twenty-seven banks and then vanished without a trace. now, a small western town is under siege, and one of the first victims is rachel's sister. the rose gang is ready to ride again. and this time it's personal.<br /><br />rachel (michael calhoun), chastity (lil' kim), maria (lisaraye), zang li (marie matiko) and kim (stacey dash), five gunslinging women who split up after five years of riding together. when rachel's sister is killed, she ends up rounding up her friends once again and riding on a trail of vengeance. <br /><br />a good, muck around version of western. (if you've seen bad girls, well this is a little bit better in the ways of the female characters).<br /><br />i gave it 10/10 because the characters, plot and scenery made it for me.
