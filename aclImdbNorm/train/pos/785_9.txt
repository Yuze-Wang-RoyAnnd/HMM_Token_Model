me being of irish origins, loved this movie, not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest. i loved the girl who he fell in love with too, she was pretty. they were such a cute couple. the ending was so sad. love this movie! although it is a little dirty, it reminds of a british or irish version of prime. if you liked this movie you should watch prime. same story line young guy falls for older women, older women falls for young guy to. a lot of paths cross, in the end, the best decision is made or task is completed. don't have anything else to say, without ruining the whole movie, all though i thought the french guy was ugly, less appealing to me. umm...if you like irish movies, i would recommend "circle of friends" ,that movie is so good. quick quote, you might not get unless you watch it" well, thats my dinner ruined." lol
