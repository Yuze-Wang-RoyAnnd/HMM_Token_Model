"sasquatch hunters" actually wasn't as bad as i thought.<br /><br />**spoilers**<br /><br />traveling into the woods, park rangers charles landon, (kevin o'connor) roger gordon, (matt latimore) brian stratton (david zelina) spencer combs, (rick holland) and his sister janet, (stacey branscombe) escort dr. helen gilbert, (amy shelton-white) her boss dr. ethan edwards, (gary sturm) and assistant louise keaton, (juliana dever) to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area. when they make camp, the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area. when members of the group start to disappear, they start to wander through the woods to safety. it's discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings, and the team band together to survive.<br /><br />the good news: this wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half-way point, when the creature attacks. that is a masterful series of scenes, as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature, and the suspense throughout the entire play-out is extremely high. the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts, heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance. also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off-screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly. they really do add much to make this part so creepy, as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard. it's quite effective, and works well. it's quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace, as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action. one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing. as a man is running through the forest from the creature, he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it. raising his hands to holler to them for help, the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily. it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing.<br /><br />the bad news: there was only a couple things to complain about here, and one is a usual complaint. the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi, which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it might've had. the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen. it's so distracting that it's a shame a little more work wasn't put into it. i've complained about this one a lot, and is something that really should be done away with, as it doesn't look that realistic and is quite fake. another big one is the off-screen kills in here. very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away, and then finding the bloody body afterward. it's quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward. otherwise, i don't really have much of a problem with this one, as everything else that's usually critiqued about this one didn't really bother me, but it is called on for others beyond this stuff.<br /><br />the final verdict: i kinda liked this one, but it's still not the best sasquatch movie ever. it's not supposed to be taken seriously, and if viewed that way, it's actually quoit enjoyable. fans of these films should give this one a look, and those that like the sci-fi creature features might find some nice things in here as well.<br /><br />rated r: graphic language, violence and some graphic carcasses
