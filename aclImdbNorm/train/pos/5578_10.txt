a hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer/director peter m. cohen. the story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to confer about their dating woes. we meet brad: a good-looking, wall-street playboy with a quick-wit and sharp tongue; zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; jonathan: a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and eric: the married guy, who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence. the trials and tribulations of the men's single lives in new york are amusingly expressed, mirroring that of sex in the city and hbo's new comedy the mind of married man, and bring an astute light to scamming. the story takes a twist as the three singletons meet mia--wittily played by amanda peet-and all fall for her. she seduces them each with her uncanny ability to conform to the personalities' they exhibit. when they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman, they chose her over their friendship. whipped is a realistic portrayal of the dating world, one that the critic's failed to recognize. in plain language, they missed the point. the protagonist's here are caricatures of real people. the exaggerations are hysterical, mixing satire and humility, and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic's disparagement suggests. see this movie, you'll laugh from start to finish.
