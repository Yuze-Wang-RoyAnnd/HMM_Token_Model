ah, moonwalker, i'm a huge michael jackson fan, i grew up with his music, thriller was actually the first music video i ever saw apparently. believe it or not there was a time where michael jackson was like a god to people, a time where women fainted at the sight of him before really fainting before seeing the sight of him, sorry, michael. but moonwalker was what started to be a tribute to all of michael's success of the time right when he released his famous bad album that was record breaking, was the first album to have 6 top ten singles. michael is an incredible artist, there is no doubt, he writes, sings, dances, but when it comes to acting or keeping a story straight with his audience
