david duchovny plays the lead role in this film.now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.very unfair to say the least.david made his name on the x-files and is a decent actor. dr eugene sands(duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.by sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire raymond blossom.however the fbi take an interest in using eugene to snare blossom. angelina jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.she puts in a solid performance. timothy hutton playing blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character. duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible.his familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen't detract too much from the film
