daniel day-lewis is the most versatile actor alive. english aristocratic snob in a room with a view, passionate irish thief in in the name of the father, an impudent, violent butcher in gangs of new york (in a performance ten times stronger than adrian brody's in the pianist) and as the outrageous cristy brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot (just to name a few). his roles all influence eachother, but each is seperate, and utterly unique. he changes completely, with each character he takes on. and i'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything. anything.<br /><br />as cristy brown he is stunning. he does not ridicule the character, and he does not pity the character. a difficult achievement. and cristy brown comes to life. a smart man. an outrageous man. human.<br /><br />this movie, despite small scene-transition faults and the like, is an inspiration. yes, it's predictable. but is it stupidly sentimental? no. i laughed. i cried. not a single moment of cheese. proof that this isn't a hollywood movie.<br /><br />my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when cristy is discussing painters with eileen, peter and her friends. here's where daniel day-lewis reaches an acting climax. "i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated." "wheel out the cripple!" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />a must-see. fo sho, yo!
