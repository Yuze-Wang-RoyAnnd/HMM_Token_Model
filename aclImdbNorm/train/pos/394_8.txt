this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind, tsui hark. it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chow's shaolin soccer. from the moment the movie started,there was astronishing backdrops at every edge which were<br /><br />deplicted with superb style. if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts "geek", you'll love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons. there, comes a fine performance(as always) from ekin cheung who plays "sky king". he teams up with louis koo(red) who i was very impressed by his flexible "wing" which deflected incoming attacks. the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way. not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline. many criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of story/theme or just "shoved in random bits of debrise" and even describe as "the legend of poo". however, the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie. others who are famarialy with "wu xia" movies will have a better appoach. in due respect. there can be one weakness that could be foreseen. the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly made.in spite of all this, its a must see.
