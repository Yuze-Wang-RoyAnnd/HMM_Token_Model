i don't know what it is with this movies. but movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy. of course it's not 100% accurate. it's difficult to make 100% accurate films nowadays when even the "experts" disagree with each other. therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies.<br /><br />so i start by saying that i liked this mini serie. but i do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast. the series should have been a three part story, his childhood being the first part. but if they didn't have more money to shoot more story who am i to criticise that???<br /><br />there's only one real problem i have with this movie and that's the fact that it's told in a history book way. especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened. i rather would have liked to see hitler more humane (more scenes where he doubts himself etc.). noah taylor did that more in the movie 'max' which seem to work better i think. nevertheless i'm glad this was made and own it on dvd. just to remember more vividly what happened and see carlyle giving his best. 7.5/10
