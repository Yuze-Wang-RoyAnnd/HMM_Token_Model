one measurement for the greatness of a movie is, 'if it came on t.v. right now, would you want to sit there and watch it again?' my answer for the grand canyon is as powerful a "yes" as it would be for nearly any movie i have ever seen. there are just so many powerful moments, such an intelligent and moving story, such incredible performances. <br /><br /> it perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early nineties. but it also dramatically affirms the capacity of individuals to love, think and care. in a slight way, the movie was of its time. it partly portrays society as a balloon about to burst. because the country was in a recession, and so void of leadership, this was true of that time. but the movie is also timeless. i think it could honestly stand up against any movie that has ever been made, and it is the most overlooked film of all time.
