i saw jack frost for lb4:00 at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good. for starters this film is about a killer snowman so that's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /><br />the acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing "i only axed you for a smoke" and "worlds most pi**ed off snow cone" how funny and camp is that? the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too "jack be nimble, jack be quick, jack gouged eyes with candle sticks". if you're looking for a for a b-movie comedy horror that's full of puns then check jack frost out. 10/10
