it's a little disconcerting to have a character named gig young in a movie...played by gig young. but this film is where gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name.<br /><br />i'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that i really enjoyed this film, mainly because of the vibrant performance of barbara stanwyck as fiona. she was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring, and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the lusitania, and whose father was later killed during woar war i. <br /><br />as the "man" of the house, fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father's will which would therefore allow a donald trump type named charles barclay to get the family home. but fiona's keeping a secret as to why she hates barclay so much. geraldine fitzgerald is the middle, flirty sister, who is married to an englishman but craves her youngest sister's boyfriend (gig young).<br /><br />if you're a stanwyck fan, this is a no miss.
