a young solicitor from london, arthur kidd is sent to a small coastal town of crythin gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow mrs drablow. while attending her funeral, a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention. supposedly drablow lived a reclusive life, and locals kept pretty quiet about her. after this he heads to mrs drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide. there he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house, and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes. now can mrs drablow's belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about.<br /><br />often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and i can see their point. but only in doses does it draw upon tag. yes, from what you can gather i was left a 'little' under-whelmed, despite really liking it. i was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature, but that's probably it
