this belgian film, directed by tom barman, singer of the well-known group deus, will not be favoured by everyone. for the simple reason that there isn't a clear story or even a plot. this movie just shows 24 hours in "a city" (here antwerp) and allows you to watch and truly enjoy the dialogues, the directing, the humorous (dario!, the osteopath bruno!, ...) and tragic (windman, paul garcin, ...) characters.<br /><br />there are several memorable scenes: the windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, the kiss-fan, windman visits the osteopath,...<br /><br />clearly some other viewers didn't understand what's so beautiful and interesting in this movie. they complain that this movie has no story, etc. but it's the atmosphere that keeps you watching and that will drag you into it.<br /><br />if you didn't watch it yet, be sure to listen carefully to the music. the soundtrack is extraordinary just like tom barman and his group deus.<br /><br />and "ssst, mondje dicht h'e." (don't tell anyone)
