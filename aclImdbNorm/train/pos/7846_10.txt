i'm usually not too into a specific show (save for the o.c. & desperate housewives...hey, i am 20!), but, no kidding, after one episode of reunion i was hooked.<br /><br />i can't even say how bummed i was that it's time-slot conflicted with bush's speech last night because i was really looking forward to the 1987 episode, which will now air next thursday. again, that conflict was disadvantageous because, being a new show, it needs to build up a following and having the second episode pushed back a week kills some momentum.<br /><br />that said, tv doesn't always have to be emmy worthy to be enjoyable. i don't expect reunion to take home any prizes, but i do expect it will be able to capture my attention all season. ever watch the first few episodes of a beloved show years later? sometimes you wonder how you ever got hooked. character building takes some time.<br /><br />the one episode for each year idea is wonderful, in my opinion. the only other show i can recall doing something similar is 24, with each episode being an hour...and having an eventful year is more realistic than a day that eventful! please give this show a shot. relax about art form...it's just tv!
