i also just got back from an advanced screening of redeye and i must say i haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long time. wes craven is at his best ever. he brings us an amazing end of summer thriller i was so desperately craving. this is the thriller of the year..no doubt. <br /><br />all the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. the f/x were great. it steadily built suspense. i was on the edge of my seat most of the movie. it's been a while since i heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater. <br /><br />if your looking for thrills,action and a good plot this summer, redeye delivers. go see it!
