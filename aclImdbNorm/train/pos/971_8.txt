this film is a bit reminiscent of the german film, the neverending story because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero. however, due to far superior modern technology, puppets and cgi are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world--one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope.<br /><br />i enjoyed this film, but boy was it a chore at first! unfortunately, for most westerners, this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd. however, give it a chance. don't think or try to understand everything you see--just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film.<br /><br />in many ways, this is exactly the sort of advice i'd give to adults who watch miyazaki's spirited away because it is very similar and features tons of yokai (japanese mythical spirits). the big differences between the two is that the great yokai war is live-action and spirited away is much more child-friendly. while i do think the great yokai war was intended mostly as a kids' movie, in the usa, most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it's so violent, scary and features some adult behaviors. so who is the audience in the west? well, older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-western themes and composition. this is a rather narrow audience, indeed! <br /><br />while you are watching, look for all the strange little touches. in fact, you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time. a few of the funny references i liked were the comment about gamera, the scene that came with the comment "kids: don't try this at home" as well as the use of kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the yokai (hmm,...perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning)! <br /><br />by the way, director takashi miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically, other than to say that none of his stories i've seen have seemed "normal". some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and i hated them (especially audition and ichi the killer)whereas some of them are magical and among the best films i've ever seen (the happiness of the katakuris). one thing for sure, it's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other.
