the british horror film was in terminal decline by the start of the seventies, but out of the blackness came three films that were among the best our island produced. the wickerman, blood on satan's claw and the house that dripped blood made the future seem rosy, even though a lot of people knew by this point there wasn't going to be one. thtdb has the sort of cast that could easily form a wishlist, if it hadn't actually been assembled, in the bleak hinterland of 2008 you may well find yourself expecting to wake up. waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is, naturally, my favourite, cushing's life and art are interlinked so firmly that you can't tell where performance ends and pain begins. one can only guess how this role affected such a gentle, sensitive man. death and the maiden. rip peter.
