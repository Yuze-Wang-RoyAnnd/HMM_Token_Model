michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name, including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out. iphigenia, however, is a highlight. adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides, it's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel. the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a 'big' film, with the emphasis placed on the simple story: in supplication to the gods, king agamemnon (kostas kazakos)is compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia (tatiana papamoschou), much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae (irene papas). kazakos and papas are both outstanding, but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen, blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game. strongly recommended for fans of international cinema.
