still love it 17 or so years after the first time i saw it, in fact i discovered that i had lost my copy of this and was very upset. despite it's non-association with the original (which as a kid i never noticed and as an adult i don't care about), this is what cartoons *should* be like. just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone. i'm more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing. the music is great, and gets stuck in your head forever...i have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another.
