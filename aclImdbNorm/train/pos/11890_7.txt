this is quite a dull movie. well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art-house connotations all over, it fails because the director takes no position, stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates. one of france's revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu - i believe they made 7 together - pialat fails to engage. it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around. isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like "i don't know"; "i like his arms"; "i like the way he makes love" to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because... i assume he loves her. so he accepts and hope for what? that she will one day wake up and come to her senses. things like this are not answered in pialat's condescending docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand. jules et jim, this is not. the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving.
