"yes, georgio" is a light-hearted and enjoyable movie/comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music. it's not my favorite movie but it is a movie i have enjoyed seeing more than once. some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy pavarotti, they would likely be better served by picking up an opera dvd. although, a full opera might be a better representation of pavarotti's operatic talents, oftentimes, an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. "yes, georgio" permits pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not.<br /><br />many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable; i don't agree. enormously talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. additionally, people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own. both georgio and pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other.<br /><br />relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. the ending scenes from puccini's turandot alone are worth the time to get there.
