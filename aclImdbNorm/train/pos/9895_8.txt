a bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy marty (a sympathetic performance by simon scuddamore) which leaves him hideously disfigured. five years later the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion. of course, an angry and vindictive marty shows up dressed in a jester's costume to exact a grisly revenge on his tormentors. writers/directors mark ezra, peter litten and george dugdale trot out all the endearingly corny clich'es which make these 80's slice'n'dice body count flicks so much cheesy fun: fake jump scares, prowling steadican shots, a fierce storm, an insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack, a nice smattering of gratuitous female nudity, a totally ridiculous "what the hell?" supernatural climax, tacky make-up f/x, and one of those lovably lame "it was all just a terrible dream" fake-out non-endings. moreover, the elaborate murder set pieces deliver the gruesome goods: gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after he drinks poisoned beer, a lady taking an acid bath, a guy being crushed under a huge tractor, and two people getting electrocuted while in the middle of having wild passionate sex. thirtyish british cult horror siren caroline munro is hilariously miscast as an american teenager in the first third of the flick. the cast all give solid performances, with especially stand-out work from carmine iannaccone as smartaleck ringleader skip pollack, billy hartman as faded macho meathead frank, and donna yeager as foul-mouthed slut stella. co-producer dick randall has an amusing cameo as munro's sleazy agent manny. harry manfredini's moody, rattling music shamelessly recycles cues from his "friday the 13th" scores. alan pudney's slick cinematography does the trick. good, trashy fun.
