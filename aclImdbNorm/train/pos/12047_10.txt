the first and only time i saw the woman in black was i think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on tv back in 1989. it was christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. i was quite young at the time but i'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father!.<br /><br />there are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every hollywood movie, so every creak, thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there's no distraction. another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there's no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on. this is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door!<br /><br />a superb ghost story, i've never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on tv i cant believe the bbc has deleted it after (to my knowledge) only one showing!
