this is my first comment on imdb website, and the reason i'm writing it is that we're talking about one of the best films ever! 'ne goryuy!' will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you're not a fan yet!) with georgian choir singing tradition, and possibly you will accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after watching it:) what i like a lot about this film is that actors in the non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character. the film is starring vahtang kikabidze (who is great), but you will remember every single face around him in the film. you will find yourself quoting their lines, that have become household names for so many russian-speaking people. a film to live with. simple, yet deep, you will want to watch it again and again.
