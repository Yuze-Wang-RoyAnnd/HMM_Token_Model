not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary. but clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition.<br /><br />we should not tend to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment. but, didn't we say this of "1984" ? had james orwell known the internet becoming reality not long after 1984; in fact it was in 1994; he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did. hindsight rewarded.<br /><br />it doesn't matter. what does matter is that we often regard ourselves as superior to our surroundings but indeed become emotional about a "love apple" when necessity knocks at our door. a snapshot of ourselves at old age.<br /><br />whatever the time-line will prove to be for us, i know for a fact we haven't seen the beginning of it yet.<br /><br />
