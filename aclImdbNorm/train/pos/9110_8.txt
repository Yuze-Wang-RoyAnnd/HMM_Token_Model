you know? our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... i can explain, i think!! well... until that happen on 25th april 1974, our freedom was limited, we didn't had liberty of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion, we don't use our liberty of speech! that's all a consequence of the revolution! i think that's clear!... about the movie... i think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting, but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies it's quite good!! i like it very much!
