this film is amazing and i would recommend to child and adult alike. the animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than anything the american studios were producing at the time. however, there is a couple of caveats to this statement. it's a shame that disney bought the studio ghibli back-catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it. my main point being, disney re-dubbed the film, despite the original english version being very impressive. the new cast with van der beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e.g. pazu and sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers. the original music score is also far better than the disney remix. it begs the question why did disney make such changes? it seems to me is that by having van der beek et al being cast then disney can draw in more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they tainted they film. it is still a beautiful film and i would still recommend it to anyone. my main beef is that disney ruined a film from childhood which i loved and still love. i am lucky enough to have an original japanese import with the original english dub which i am now going to guard with my life!
