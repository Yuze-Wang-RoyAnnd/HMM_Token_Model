i have seen the movie at the viennale a few years ago, where the audiences liked it. i liked it as well, summer phoenix performance still haunts me, that's why i decided to write a comment.<br /><br />the story unfolds in london around 1900, where a jewish girl decides to become an actress. she tries desperately to become one, but it isn't before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage, that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger human being.<br /><br />there were certain reviews, were her performance was smashed, they accused her of being dull, not able to bring life to her character. i think that's her strong point, that's exactly what esther kahn should be and phoenix makes a brave decision to make her esther a rather boring girl. so her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise. <br /><br />the cinematography is great, the images of london around the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was back then. <br /><br />the only fault in my opinion is the length of the movie, you loose touch with the characters, after all it's only about finding the actor in yourself, so there are no dramatic actions in the film. it's phoenix credit that we don't loose the interest in the movie after the first hour.
