this documentary by marian cooper is absolutely amazing. i saw it tonight on turner classic movie channel. i think i will see if i can order a copy of it on dvd. the film footage doesn't look all blurry and choppy like you might think from 1925 b & w silent film. set in iran in 1925, the nomadic tribe people in the documentary leave their desert home and cross a raging river, men, women, children, animals... then up and over a snowy mountain pass all barefoot. it is sink or swim and climb or die. in search of grass for their animals. they have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. in one scene a man is carrying a mule who is too sick to climb the mountain. the children in the documentary all look happy and healthy. they had such a hard life. i wonder if the nomadic tribes of iran still live like this. makes you appreciate modern life in usa.
