winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after wwii. director anthony mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. jimmy stewart does an excellent job, but i think stephen mcnalley and john mcintire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured winchester 73 going to the winner. this is a good script with several stories going on at the same time. look for the first appearance of rock hudson as young bull. thank god, with in a few years, we would begin to let indians play themselves in western films. the film is in black and white and was shot in tucson arizona. i would not put winchester 73 in the category of stagecoach, high noon or shane, but it gets an above average recommendation from me.<br /><br />.
