gerard phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, funny, tender, brave and lover.he gives a superior dimension to a movie which is even a masterpiece, as much by the other actors (gina lollobrigida:miaoooou!!) as by the story or the rhythm. never boring, always creating new emotions: for me, the best french movie of all time.
