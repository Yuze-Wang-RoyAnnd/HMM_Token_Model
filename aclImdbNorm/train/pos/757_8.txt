i need to be honest. i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross, offensive, hilarious, and raunchy. yeah, there is a lot of humor for all tastes. if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards, for example then you will have a great time for it.<br /><br />or, if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad, you will also have a great time. and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh , you will enjoy the show.<br /><br />i enjoy all three kinds of humor that "dirty s`anchez" offers. i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show. "jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass, give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show. with all due respect.<br /><br />this is a show that has little taste or class. it's not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed out.<br /><br />now, these guys need to see a psychologist. specially the paco character.
