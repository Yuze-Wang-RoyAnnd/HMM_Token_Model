before she went into politics or public service, glenda jackson was one of britain's finest film actresses. this film displays her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes julie christie as kitty, the wife of a british royal captain who has lost his memory of the last 20 years, and jenny played by american ann-margret in an almost unrecognizable role as the doting sister. alan bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by the shell shock during world war i. sir ian holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him. you see familiar faces like sheila keith, patsy byrne, and frank finlay. you can't help but watch glenda play a dowdy housewife and the first true love of the captain but they came from different classes. it's not the greatest movie but it's good to see glenda's amazing talent. she is still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. she makes margaret grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her.
