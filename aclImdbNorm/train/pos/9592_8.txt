this film came out 12 years years ago, and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york. the textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses. anthony slide's 'great pretenders' says nothing. julian fleisher's "the drag queens of new york: an illustrated field guide" with its flow chart of influence that pulls together julian eltinge, minette, the warhol queens, and the 90s club scene - and postdates the film - ignores the houses completely. even laurence senelick's "the changing room" - the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it.<br /><br />i understand from the film itself,and various articles i found on the web that this house system goes back decades. the major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be chrystal la beija in "the queen", 1968. the historical context is the biggest missing part of "paris is burning".<br /><br />the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored. it is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. the unfortunate fact that venus xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending, but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real-life murder. as we now know, dorian corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet, but this did not come out until three years later.<br /><br />of historical importance, but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context.
