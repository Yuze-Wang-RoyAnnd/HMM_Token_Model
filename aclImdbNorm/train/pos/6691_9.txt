this movie is a lot of fun. what makes it great especially are two things: one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes, with discussions of their costumes and superpowers. there's an endearing earnestness to the parody that's very appealing; the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. claire forlani deserves particular note as the object of mr. furious's desires. there's a boatload of talent here. i realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is a lot of fun, and kind of sweet.
