this movie is a lot better than the asylums version mainly its war of the worlds. the tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better. the action scenes were really cool. walking... walking...walking...walking!!! oh my god stop walking please or i'm going to kill myself. the thunder child scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship rammed bunch of tripods. good movie i recommend it for people ho have read the book. the music is awesome and the directors cut looks pretty cool.<br /><br />pros. good soundtrack 99% to the book cool violence tripods and handling machines are cool to look at<br /><br />cons. some bad acting cheesy looking london
