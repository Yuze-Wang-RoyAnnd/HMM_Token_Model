like a streetcar named desire (also directed by gadg both on stage and screen) panic in the streets depicts a new orleans in which its major claim to fame - the birthplace of jazz - doesn't even rate a mention. it was richard widmark's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer. gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with jack palance (still being billed as walter jack palance)as the local mr 'big' followed side-kick zero mostel, barbara bel geddes, emile meyer, tommy rettig plus the rock-solid ever reliable paul douglas as the cop who comes round to doc widmark's point of view. it's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen. catch it if you can.
