hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of "8"s, this movie's true score.<br /><br />as mentioned before chris rock is the king! previous to going to see this movie i wasn't that over the top about him but now i'm banging on the doors of chris rock's website begging him to take me on as his protege. this film is truly funny, if you don't find this movie funny you really need therapy and it's humour which targets all areas of society including race(predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy... the list goes on.<br /><br />there was one slight disappointment for me however. this was that in going into this film i didn't realise that it was actually a remake of "heaven can wait" another quite good movie made in 1971 with warren beatty. as such i was quite surprised when i watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie i had watched on tv a few weeks ago.. regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any...you get the picture.<br /><br />well to the actual plot of the film.<br /><br />don't spoil the experience for yourself! don't read the plot! just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it, go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time, go and see it because it's a cinema experience that doesn't leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets. go see it because it is a good movie!
