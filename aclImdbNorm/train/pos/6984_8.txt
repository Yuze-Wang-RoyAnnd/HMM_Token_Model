i was blown away by the re-imagined battlestar galactica, a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion. a hardened sci-fi fan, i like to think i can pick out the good stuff from the bs, and this was good stuff.<br /><br />as such, when i first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago i got a sick feeling in my gut. i was afraid that the formula that made battlestar so successful would be reused in caprica, which wouldn't work at all. bsg's story, of a mournful ragged band of survivors, trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors.<br /><br />caprica feels different. where bsg takes place after the fall of a great civilization, caprica portrays that civilization in it's cold and decadent heyday. the overall vibe i got from caprica was similar to that of minority report, minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality. in true bsg form, caprica has in it's first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom, racism, the morality of playing god and the nature of the human soul.<br /><br />the casting for caprica is also excellent. each character is unique and deep, from the obsessive and distant scientist-turned-entrepreneur, to his troubled and willful daughter, each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles.<br /><br />music, which was used so powerfully in bsg, also plays a significant role in caprica. battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it's themes very well. caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show it's own feeling quite distinct from either of it's predecessors. <br /><br />the new caprica is definitely it's own show, pulling from the battlestar franchise only as much as it needs. i look forward to the full series.
