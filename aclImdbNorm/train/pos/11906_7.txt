this documentary on schlockmeister william castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive '50s-'60s environment in which he did his most characteristic work--look at the funny, silly people with the ghost-glasses--but it's also affectionate and lively, with particularly bright commentary from john waters, who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time, and from castle's daughter, who adored her dad and also is pretty perceptive about how he plied his craft. (we never find out what became of the other castle offspring.) the movies were not very good, it makes clear, but his marketing of them was brilliant, and he appears to have been a sweet, hardworking family man. fun people keep popping up, like "straight jacket"'s diane baker, who looks great, and anne helm, whom she replaced at the instigation of star joan crawford. darryl hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with castle on "the tingler," and there's enough footage to give us an idea of the level of castle's talent--not very high, but very energetic. a pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased, and it does make you nostalgic for simpler movie-going days.
