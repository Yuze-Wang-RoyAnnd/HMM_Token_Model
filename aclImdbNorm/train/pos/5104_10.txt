this is a smart drama about the way of life in a texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. john travolta and debra winger turn out two very believable performances as bud and sissy davis. this film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce america to the mechanical bull. if you love a good romance film, then you will love this movie.
