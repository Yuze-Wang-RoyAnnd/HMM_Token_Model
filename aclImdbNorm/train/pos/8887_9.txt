as i saw the movie i was really shocked to see what the 60's was about. i know i may be wrong about some things, but it seemed like the 60's really had an effect on people of the time. some people said they would want to go back to the 60's. from what i saw i would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome. but that's my opinion.
