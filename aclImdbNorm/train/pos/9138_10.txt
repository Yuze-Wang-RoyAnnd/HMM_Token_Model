i own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and i feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just the best one to tell this story through influence. most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a great movie with even better music. the principals and moral convictions in purple rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.
