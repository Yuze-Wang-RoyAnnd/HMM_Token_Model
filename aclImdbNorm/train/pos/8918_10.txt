no hidden agenda. pure scifi. all fun.<br /><br />i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad. i was a kid :)<br /><br />the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten. the original one, starring the great movie star steve mcqueen (bullet), is by far the better and only version anyone should see.<br /><br />the movie production is dated, but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time. i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord. 10/10<br /><br />-zafoid
