this film takes you inside itself in the early minutes and holds you till the end. it has a very humane story and very good selected music. the acting of moritz bleibtreu (giancarlo amato) and barnaby metschurat (gigi amato) is satisfying. recommended to people who get bored of action films and want to see a good movie.
