as a pagan, i must say this movie has little if any magickal significance. it's a "fun" witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magick of all, and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way. that's a lesson everyone needs to learn, not just pagans.<br /><br />that having been said, this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by kim novak and the venerable jimmy stewart.<br /><br />hermione gingold delivers a stellar performance as bianca, elsa lanchester (with too many movie credits to mention except as ms. jane marbles of "murder by death") was wonderful as ms. novak's absent-minded-yet-capable upstairs neighbor queenie. also starring jack lemmon (wonderful performance) and jim kovacs (brilliantly witty).<br /><br />"witches can't cry. why, they can't shed a single tear because their heart is full of magick. they don't have time for silly things such as love." queenie.<br /><br />gillian holroyd (novak) and her brother nicky (jack lemmon) are manhattan witches. cloaked deeply within the secret underworld of those of the craft, they live among other new yorkers as one of them, without so much as causing a raised eyebrow. <br /><br />but then, along comes shepherd "shep" henderson (stewart), a steadfast, no-nonsense, dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to gillian's old college rival. <br /><br />by a quirky mishap of chance, he finds himself moving into gillian's building and is instantly "bewitched" by her charm and grace. by the use of magick, with a little help from pyewacket (gillian's familiar, trained by robert e. blair) and queenie, gillian begins to work on this handsome new dream man to get back at her old enemy.<br /><br />but magick should never be used to control, nor to hurt, and gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way. not only does she have to face what she's done, but she has to face shep in her guilt. <br /><br />from the critical perspective; however, the movie takes a serious turn: the effects are very dated to the point of being pure camp. some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someone's small home, but at least the characters were quirky and fun.<br /><br />on a personal note, pyewacket steals the show. great cat! great training by robert e. blair. <br /><br />as a note of trivia, this is the roots for the beloved bewitched television sitcom. this introduces the original samantha and darrin. all the characters of note are present and accounted for. you have but to look, to see it for yourself.<br /><br />this is one of my favorites, and i watch it often.<br /><br />this movie gets a 9.1/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
