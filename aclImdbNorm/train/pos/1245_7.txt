whenever i see most reviews it's called 'a misfire for eddie murphy'. these critics want to take a look at some of the stuff he's doing these days, and maybe soften their stance in retrospect... "the golden child" is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clich'es, and gives murphy one of his best roles. i don't understand the pervading lack of 'love' for its efforts, at all. perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout, thrill-a-minute adventures? steven spielberg started it with indiana jones; it's unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless. there's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends.<br /><br />yes it's silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where hollywood's idea of mysticism begins and ends. what's more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine. my advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.
