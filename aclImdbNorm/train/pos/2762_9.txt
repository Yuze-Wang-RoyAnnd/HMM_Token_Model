this film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid. there is really not much i'd need or want to say here. except maybe "see this film" and "enjoy the excellent work by daniel and pascal", who carries you through this neat, funny and heartbreaking story about 'spending your eighth day' - your own day! <br /><br />seeing this film made me think seriously about how i spend my eighth day = my life! it appears, that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do. either if it's pleasing a career or just consuming tv-shows and ballgames. what we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - make a difference. about taking room and time to be spontaneous and live - now! (on the eighth day)... at least that was what i got from 'the eighth day'.
