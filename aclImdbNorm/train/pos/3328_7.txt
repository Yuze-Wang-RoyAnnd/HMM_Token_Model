it's rare, nowadays, to find a romantic comedy that isn't incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie (eg. big fat greek wedding; me, myself & irene). there were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie, nothing unpalatably profane. all around, it was a cute movie with likable characters. i thought the ending was a little abrupt. it feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish. the acting left a little to be desired, but was made up for by the pace of the story. if i'd known it was a farrelly brothers movie i would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it, but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie. good for them, i hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films.
