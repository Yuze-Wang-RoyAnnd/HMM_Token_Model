this was the worst movie i've ever seen, yet it was also the best movie. sci fi original movie's are supposed to be bad, that's what makes them fun! the line, "i like my dinosaur meat well done!" is probably the best quote ever! also, the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream. i can imagine it now, the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution, then putting ideas together for this: space marines got to alien planet, which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it, to protect a science team studying the planet. best idea ever! in fact, in fits the complete sci fi original movie checklist: guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible acting<br /><br />so go watch this movie, but don't buy it.
