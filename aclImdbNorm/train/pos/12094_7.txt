castle of blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in italy in the 60s. the film has all of the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story, and barbara steele. steele makes most any film worth seeing.<br /><br />the story concerns a haunted castle. people have visited, but none have returned. our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings. but, the night he visits is a special night. it's the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths.<br /><br />the only flaw i see in the movie is the running time. it almost feels padded. there is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens. our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest. but once he does find something, the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable.<br /><br />castle of blood is a definite must for steele fans and fans of italian gothic horror in general.
