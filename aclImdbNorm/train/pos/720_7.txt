just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this: the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmasters and teachers. "rock 'n' roll high school" is taking place in that world. it's like a ramones record coming to life. the characters are all as silly, innocent and charming as the ramones' songs, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. high school comedies have really changed over the years, if you compare a movie like "american pie" with this late 70's classic, where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all. since a remake is apparently in the works, it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar, half-funny dick jokes, as bill hicks used to call them. however, the main problem will be that the ramones cannot be replaced. they were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place. so, the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone, as quirky and charming as it is. gabba-gabba hey!
