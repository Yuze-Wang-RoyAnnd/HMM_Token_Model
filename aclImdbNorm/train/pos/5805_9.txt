(there isn't much in the way of spoilers, since there isn't a plot to reveal, but still, i guess i describe some of what happens so...) this is it. this is the most nonsensical film i've ever seen. there are simply no words to describe this movie, although "bizarre" "ridiculous" and "ego trip" are pretty close. the opening half hour or so are really, really weird music videos, with absolutely no plot or continuity, apart from that mj falls into some from the previous. one of the highlights of this part of the "film" in the section where mj is flying a merry-go-round aeroplane through what seem to be half-arsed bond intro rejects and sections cut from yellow submarine (dear lord you could not make this up).<br /><br />then, with a little over an hour remaining, the "film" begins, with a lot of claymation (some of it really creepy) spotting our "hero" and chasing him looking for an autograph. obviously, this leaves our as of yet mute (discounting songs) lead somewhat worried, and he manages to temporarily lose them. fortunate for him, because it means he can witness a falling star and, and again, i'm not making this up, turn into a claymation rabbit. he uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak past them, but, for reasons i can't recall right now, they see through it (oh no!) and the creepy chase begins again. cue another song (big shock there).<br /><br />shortly after the end of the chase, mj somehow brings the rabbit to life, until he is busted by a policeman (in the middle of the desert) because it is, apparently, illegal to dance there.<br /><br />the rest of the film is equally as strange, highlights including mj cleaning up a bar to the tune of smooth criminal, including shooting a man with his finger, not only killing the guy, but burning his shadow into the wall, a la nuclear fission weapons. another good moment is when mj, seeing, mr big (joe "what the hell happened to his career at this point?" peschi) kidnap one of the children he was friends with, magically creates a tommy gun, and in another moment of violence that pepper this film seemingly at random, opens fire at everything that moves. a final moment i shall mention is when mj, surrounded by mr big and his private army. seriously, this guy has dozens of people working for him, and they're decked out more like commando units rather than mobsters, which i guess they are. how does he get out? why, he turns into a robot, complete with weapons and shield. this is the third of four transformations he makes, almost always when backed into a corner and/or on the run.<br /><br />this film is quite, quite surreal, with little in the way of plot, and virtually no continuity.
