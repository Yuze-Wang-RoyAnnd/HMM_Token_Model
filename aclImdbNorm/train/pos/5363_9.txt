this is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring arnold schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including the television networks. one of their most popular tv shows is "the running man", where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions. it's set up like a game show, where the audience votes for their favorite "stalkers", trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky "contestants". audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. and the host is played by none other than family feud's richard dawson, who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role. when ben richards (arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game.<br /><br />this movie is chock full of classic arnold one-liners, such as his famous "i'll be back" right before he enters the arena. and he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "how about a light?" i could go on and on, but i don't want to spoil the movie. it's funny stuff!<br /><br />whether it was intended or not, this movie serves as a great parody of today's "reality tv" craze. already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even court cases are televised for their "entertainment value". running man demonstrates what would happen if reality tv hit rock bottom, and it is a scary picture. one can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far.<br /><br />overall, this is a fun film & i highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
