ok, i overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews. but i did enjoy it. i didn't laugh out loud, but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point. the story built. yeah, you knew it would have an happy ending--this genre always does. meantime, it was quirky with sight gags you could miss, so pay attention when you watch. stiller and black delivered expertly yet again. good team. they should work together more. don't know that it will be a cult classic, but it was certainly a fun ride. not as good as what about bob, or dirty rotten scoundrels but what is? it is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie.
