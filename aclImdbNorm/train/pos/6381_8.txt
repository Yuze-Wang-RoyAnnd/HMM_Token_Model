"atlantis" is a new and right step for a disney feature. it's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like "atlantis". i didn't have any expectations for this film, but after watching it, i don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews. even in my country the reviewers weren't positive.<br /><br />"atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but still one of disney's greatest, even i doubt that this film ever will get "disney classic" reputation. well, that's another case. it's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as "beauty and the beast" and "hunchback" (so kirk wise and gary trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation, he he, i'm just kidding).<br /><br />well, enough nonsense. "atlantis" is a watchable, exiting and very enjoyable film. even this film it's a pg-rated action-feature, it's also suitable for kids, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing this, he he).<br /><br />the story is a little predictable, but it doesn't ruin the movie. the comic book-inspired animation it's suitable for the film and set's a departure from the usual disney-style. it's colorful, dark and detailed. the deep canvas sequences are pretty impressive. the film is also funny sometimes, even i more giggled than laugh through the movie. (spoilers) the characters of this film are also very likable, but unfortunately there isn't enough screen time to get to know everybody, so some characters are left behind (spoilers).<br /><br />the score of james newton howard is absolutely great. it's daring and exotic. (spoiler) the most impressive about this film is how they're making the atlantean language sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. it's really awesome (spoilers over)<br /><br />the script is tight and well-written, but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story. but luckily there are not so much of them.<br /><br />so do you're self a favor, don't listen to the reviewers and watch "atlantis", cause it's waiting for you...
