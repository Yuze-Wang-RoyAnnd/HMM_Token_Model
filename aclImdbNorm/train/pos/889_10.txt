this is one of the best hong kong (action) films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes. this sammo film has it all, romance, drama, excitement and a great hero as well. it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights. sammo fans- this is a must see (see also eastern condors, shanghai express (yuen biao is ace!), dragons forever and enter the fat dragon.
