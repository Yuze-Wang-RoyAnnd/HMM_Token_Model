if you were brought up on a diet of gameshows you'll understand that you gradually need a bigger and better fix. well, in the world of the running man, your needs will be sated. for in this game show, prisoners compete for freedom, and the ultimate prize - their very lives.<br /><br />i loved this film. it was such a parody on the mind-numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis. it isn't one of schwarzenegger's best performances, but on the whole it is a very good film. the underlying idea that television corporations will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very believable, and is very well portrayed in this film. of course there are the usual arnie one-liners, my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone, the gameshow host asks "any last words?" arnie says: "yeah, i'll be back" but the host quips "only in a re-run" and presses the eject button. i give this film a 10 for sheer originality. i must have watched it 30 or more times. the only film apart from the die hard series that i watched this often!!<br /><br />in short, do not for a minute think that you own the t.v. - it owns you.....
