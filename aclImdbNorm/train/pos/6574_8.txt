this could be difficult to for some people to get into, being used to hollywood production styles. the directing is uninspired, apparently simply a filming of the stage set-up, and the audio quality is bad here and there (the rustling of people's clothes occasionally competes with their voices, etc.).<br /><br />my friends and i started watching without knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost put us off. it seemed very stagy and cheesy. then we picked up on the tone of the content, and really started to enjoy ourselves.<br /><br />it is very funny, despite some corniness. definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialog. also, helena bonham carter is adorable, of course.
