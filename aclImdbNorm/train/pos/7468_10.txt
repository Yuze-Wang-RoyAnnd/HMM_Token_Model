as the one-line summary says, two movies have left such a remark on me when i walked out of the theater. the one was "stir of echoes" with kevin bacon, and the second was "vanilla sky".<br /><br />its one of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you, stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie swift you where it wants... walking out of the cinema was a bit weird, like that feeling you get when you are sick and cant think of anything. one of those movies that you become one with the guy, and feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie.<br /><br />one thing is certain. the actors are awesome, the sound track is excellent, and everything in the movie is 9+.<br /><br />surely one of the best movies i ever saw, and the movie that made the best and most shocking awaking about my life and my purpose in this world.
