this is without a doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen. the first time i saw it i was about 9 or 10 years old. i began looking sometime before the rape scene. and when i saw it i was really shocked thinking "what kinda sick movie is this?". today i've seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is. it's exciting, frightening, shocking and in it's own unique way disturbing. but the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lifes. it'll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the bodies being found in that river. and there is nothing they can do about it, it's something they have to live with. this ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart, brilliant and horrifying<br /><br />and the acting is also great, especially jon voight and burt reynolds. magnificent acting in this movie. all in all, john boorman has created one of the best movies throughout movie history based on dick chaney's novel. a must see for all the movie lovers
