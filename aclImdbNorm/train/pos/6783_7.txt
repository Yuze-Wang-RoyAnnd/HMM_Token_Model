if you like "othello," you'll love this flick since half the movie revolves around the stage production of the play.<br /><br />the film has a great cast with signe hasso and shelley winters as the women in colman's life while edmond o'brien plays the enterprising press agent.<br /><br />a couple of the supporting players i particularly liked were millard mitchell as the grizzled reporter who finds an angle and joe sawyer, the 1940's answer to drew carey, who plays the cop on the case.<br /><br />great raw moments in this one with noir realism throughout.
