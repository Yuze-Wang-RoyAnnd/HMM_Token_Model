i stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago, and fell in love with it. it features t'ea leoni and holland taylor and kept me laughing, one episode after the next. i guess it didn't make it so big, and was cancelled after a few seasons, but i believe it was a good run, and would suggest watching it...if the opportunity arises.
