i am glad other people enjoyed this movie, cause i know it doesn't have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office. i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why - bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches, the cast (especially coleen camp) is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film. you've seen worse movies!
