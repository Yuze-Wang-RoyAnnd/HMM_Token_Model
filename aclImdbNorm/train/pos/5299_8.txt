once you can get past the film's title, "pecker" is a great film, perhaps one of john waters' best. a wonderful cast, headed by strong performances by edward furlong and christina ricci, make the story very funny, and very real. there are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children, but they are there for a purpose. unfortunately this movie was not mass produced, and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to view it. if the opportunity knocks, then go see this film.
