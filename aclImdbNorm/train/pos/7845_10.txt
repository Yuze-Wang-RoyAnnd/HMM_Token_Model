so, fox pulled the plug midway through a drama/mystery...<br /><br />how lame is that? do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens? why weren't the remaining, already filmed episodes aired in the us? they were broadcast elsewhere.<br /><br />hey, fox! are you listening? this was a great show, but you left us hanging. if you're going to introduce new drama/mysteries, at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid-theme. every time something like this happens (and it seems to happen a lot with you - i.e., fox), there are more of those who will "wait and see" before investing their time. this means you will see an artificially low interest share, and are more likely to end the series. see? it is a vicious cycle. don't let us down again...
