deliverance is john boorman's 1972 horror/thriller movie about a group of four atlanta businessmen (burt reynolds, jon voight, ned beatty and ronnie cox), that undertake a canoe trip down the cahulawassee river before the river is dammed. along the way, a raft (no pun intended) of unpleasant things happen to the men. despite the nasty happenings in this picture, boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely. the location was really chosen well. indeed, this would still be a very nice film to watch, had the canoe trip gone smoothly. the lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible. not only is the location scenic, but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer vilmos zsigmond. it has been said that burt reynolds' performance as the outdoorsman, lewis, is the star acting role in this film. i reckon however, that jon voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man, ed, who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive. in fact, the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman. it was voight himself. to cut costs the filming wasn't insured and the actors did their own stunts. the soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. eric weissberg's and steve mendel's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the duelling banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance. at a couple of other points in the movie, we are treated to more, softer, banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river for all the good points of this film, i did find it a little lacking in purpose. it doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe. the plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere. nevertheless, this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation. i did like it but for fans of gore, there isn't really much of it. none really, in fact. it isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour. think of it like rambo: first blood meets three men in a boat. look out for a very young charley boorman as ed's son. i did like this movie, the soundtrack, cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10.
