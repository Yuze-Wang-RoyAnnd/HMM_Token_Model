it is a story of siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties. it is about passion and feelings, about russian soul, and very romantic. this movie is not action packed, it flowes slowely. in second part one can find great songs - russian romances. it is much more better than doctor zhivago. the director of this movie moved to america and made runaway train for example.
