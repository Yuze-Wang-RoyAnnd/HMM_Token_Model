'the shop around the corner (1940)' is a pleasant romantic comedy, not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days, but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation. by 1940, director ernst lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm, and his famed "lubitsch touch" had become a sparkling commercial trademark. this film was planned for a 1939 release, but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret sullavan were unavailable for filming. rather than substituting either of his main stars, lubitsch decided to postpone production, in the meantime directing greta garbo in 'ninotchka (1939).' when it was finally completed, 'the shop around the corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference, receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role. time, nevertheless, has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence, with high-profile remakes including 'in the good old summertime (1949)' and 'you've got mail (1998).'<br /><br />at its surface, one might assume 'the shop around the corner' to simply be the story of two lovers, klara novak (sullavan) and alfred kralik (stewart), who love each other without knowing it. however, lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that. it's the story of matuschek and company, a stylish gift shop in budapest, and the various human relationships that make the store such a close-knit family. when store-owner hugo matuschek (frank morgan) begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife, we witness the breakdown of two families, both at home and at work. there's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states
