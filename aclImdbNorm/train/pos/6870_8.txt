from start to finish, i laughed real hard throughout the whole movie. it's amazing that "the groove tube" is possibly the granddaddy, yet raunchiest, of all comedic skit movies.this is the way i enjoy watching tv without being bored at flipping channels only to suffer from insomnia! for 73 minutes, the weird, strange humor never stops! just think of how all this nonsense laughing can help you enjoy life easier! it's way, way better than comedy central or any prime time show! do yourself a favor and trash all those soft, lame romantic comedy movies into the wastebasket! better yet, tell your box office manager you want "the groove tube" back on the big screen!
