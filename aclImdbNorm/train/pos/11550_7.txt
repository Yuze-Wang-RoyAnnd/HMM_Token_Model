if you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this film, you will be left with a fantastic comedy. as it is, i still found it to be a pretty good movie, which is no small feat considering the coma i was put in by the opening scenes. to put it mildly, this film has a dreary beginning that wasn't even remotely funny, or even upbeat. once things get sillier, however, you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades. definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger fan of lemmon and matthau who wants to see their earlier work.
