i watched the dvd of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track (in english). it seems in cambodia (the subtitles in english say the character is speaking thai but the movie says cambodia)a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill. he sends pang to kill some people in china and during the killings a cop's partner is killed. the cop wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma. wai's chief is his dad's friend and is worried about wai's erratic behavior. he doesn't know wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma. pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father won't let her leave (pang doesn't speak chinese and doesn't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for cat iii). wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting pang but pang is almost unstoppable. even after pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant wai follows and joins the evil man (who's training the boys)making a deal to fight and train so he can get pang. there is a big showdown between wai and pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving wai dead and pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer. this film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. there are many very brutal violent scenes. the woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot. knives to the neck and torso. guns fired directly to the head. and several very intense beatings. it maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing.
