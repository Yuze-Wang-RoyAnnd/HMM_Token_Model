i saw this film for the very first time several years ago - and was hooked up in an instant. it is great and much better than j. f. k. cause you always have to think 'can it happen to me? can i become a murderer?' you cannot turn of the tv or your vcr without thinking about the plot and the end, which you should'nt miss under any circumstances.
