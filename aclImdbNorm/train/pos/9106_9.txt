since i watched it for the first time, "piedras" is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures i actually could watch over and over again. the great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women (all of them somehow interconnected) with deep understanding and sensibility. ram'on salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut, and proves himself as an efficient actors' director. <br /><br />not that all performances are excellent, though. of all leading ladies, they range from average (najwa nimri) to very good (vicky pe~na), but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer m'onica cervera, who convincingly plays antonia san juan's retarded daughter. enrique alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl's male nurse, and there are nice small turns from andr'es gertr'udix, geli albaladejo and the director himself, ram'on salazar.<br /><br />"piedras" is beautifully written and filmed, when i watched it i got so moved that i couldn't stop thinking of it for days. i highly recommend it.
