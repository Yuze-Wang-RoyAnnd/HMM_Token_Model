when it comes to the erotic genre, i'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch. this movie is different. julie davis (i love you don't touch me) directed two very strong lead actors kira reed and doug jeffery in this enthralling thriller. kira is convincing as "kim" a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug jeffery's "the man" a handsome stranger. kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role, and as actress, giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability. i believe it to be her best performance yet. and julie davis' direction is a great gift to erotica.
