this is one of my all time favorite movies, period. i can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does. this flick has it all: action, adventure, science fiction, good vs. bad and even some romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between the pazu and sheeta). maybe best of all, you don't have to be in mensa to "get it" and enjoy the movie like you do with some of miyazaki's other movies (i don't know about you, but i watch movies to take a break from thinking). this is just a flat-out enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. the only sour note is the american dubbing. i found vander-geek to be just plain annoying. but all is not lost, the original japanese version is on the two-disc set and it rocks! who cares if you can't understand spoken japanese? if you can read at a second-grade level then watch the original japanese recording with english subtitles. you won't regret it.
