i have not read the other comments on the film, but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary.<br /><br />i watched it for the second time with my children. they absolutely loved it. true, it did not have the adults rolling around the floor, but the sound of the children's enjoyment made it seem so.<br /><br />it is a true mel brooks farce, with plenty of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, not for whom we are, and how fickle are our friends and associates. there are many other films on a similar subject matter, no doubt, many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults. it's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family, however.<br /><br />hence, for the children, a 9/10 from me.
