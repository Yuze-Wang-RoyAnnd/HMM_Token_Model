the sequel to the ever popular cinderella story reminded me somewhat of what they did with one of the beauty & the beast movies. it's basically three short stories rolled into 1.<br /><br />ok, the mice are adorable (i love gus! he's sooo cute!), and lucifer's awesome (as usual). i liked some of the newer characters as well, (pom pom was adorable and i did like prudence.). still, the storyline was somewhat limited, but still very cute. so, i vote 7/10.
