holes, originally a novel by louis sachar, was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-made film. starring sigourney weaver as the warden, shia labeouf as stanley, and khleo thomas as zero, the roles were very well casted, and the actors portrayed their roles well.<br /><br />the film had inter-weaving storylines that all led up to the end. the main storyline is about stanley yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at camp greenlake. the second storyline is about sam and kate barlow. this plot deals with racism and it is the more deep storyline to the movie. the third is about elya yelnats and madame zeroni, which explains the 100-year curse on the yelnats family. in my opinion, these storylines were weaved together very well.<br /><br />contrary to many people's beliefs, i think that you do not have to have read the book to understand the movie. the film is reasonably easy to understand.<br /><br />the acting in the film was well done, especially shia labeouf (stanley), khleo thomas (zero), sigourney weaver (the warden), and jon voight (mr. sir). the other members of d-tent, jake smith (squid), max kasch (zig-zag), miguel castro (magnet), byron cotton (armpit), and brenden jefferson (x-ray), enhanced the comic relief of the movie. however, the best parts were with zero and stanley, who made a great team together.<br /><br />although holes is a disney movie, it deals with some serious issues such as racism, shootings, and violence. the film's dramatization at some points is very well done.<br /><br />i would suggest this movie to people of all ages, whether they have read the book or not. you shouldn't miss it.
