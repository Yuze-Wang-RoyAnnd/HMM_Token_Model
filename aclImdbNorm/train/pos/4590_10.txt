maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best jackie chan's movies, but i think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made. there also was some memorable stunts, which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. this movie influenced many other action movies and i think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film (like they could remake that chase scene, i thing with modern technologies they could make it even better). there also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when jackie wasn't fighting. althou i think they could put more fighting scenes in this film.
