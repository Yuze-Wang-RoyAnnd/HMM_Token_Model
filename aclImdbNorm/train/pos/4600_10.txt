this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here. this is still the best action movie ever done. the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly. only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan. the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever. the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing. the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film. the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt.
