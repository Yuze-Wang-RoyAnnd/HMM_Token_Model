sequels hardly ever live up to the original. this definitely proves true in this case. however, if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch. although the camera work is lacking, brian krause's character is annoying, and the plot is clique, it's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it. <br /><br />don't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film. quite frankly it's a bit different. rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays, stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project, cabin by the lake. this movie has a much different feel but it's still great to see stanley back in action.<br /><br />i'm giving it a 6 out of 10.
