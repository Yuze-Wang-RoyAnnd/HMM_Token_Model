beside the fact, that in all it's awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations, this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in it's best! paul johansson and craig sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it. as usual a woman concieling her true intentions. the end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of keith scott by his older brother.<br /><br />the scenes in 'wiking land' are just as i remember it from my early time travels. - to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collection.<br /><br />i recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree hill.<br /><br />-odin-
