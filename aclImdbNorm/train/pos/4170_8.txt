i've seen this movie more than once. it was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in television movies back then. the only problem i had was with the title for the obvious reasons... one immediately thinks of the famous snack cake by drake's! leaving off the first part, 'hound of hell' would have sufficed.<br /><br />richard crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does, anyway - whether the plot is good or bad. but this was an enjoyable halloween fare offered by the cbs network. i loved the part where crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast. he asks the cab driver how to find this guy. great dialogue between the native cab driver and crenna in terms of the cabby dissing his own people's ethnic beliefs. 'aw, mr. barry, i left that stuff behind when i came down from the mountains...' - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and nobody knows how to really contact him. <br /><br />as far as supernatural fare goes, this movie is still enjoyable.
