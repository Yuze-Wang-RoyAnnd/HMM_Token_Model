this is an excellent modern-day film noir...."excellent" in that it's interesting, start-to-finish. there are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief.....but i haven't found anyone who didn't get caught up in this story. the movie has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. in addition, it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack. <br /><br />i labeled this crime movie a "film noir" because it's gritty and the all the characters are no good. even the only supposed-good guy, played by nicholas cage, gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should't have. he also does something at the end which isn't right, but i'm not going the spoil it by saying. suffice to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad they make cage look good!<br /><br />speaking of "bad guys," does anyone do it better than dennis hopper? not many. at least in the "deranged" category, he's tough to beat. lara flynn boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons. j.t. walsh gives another great supporting performance, too.<br /><br />this is one of those films that never got much publicity, but it should have. you'll have fun watching this. by the way, try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up!
