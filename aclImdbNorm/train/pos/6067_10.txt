although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie, i am ashamed to say i rather like it. not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham! video, so it is most definitely worth a viewing (lb0.79 a night in my local store!). watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster's costume, the fact that the 'hero' looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following: evil wizard-type bloke: "at last we meet kor..." kor: "thrilling, isn't it?"<br /><br />amazing!!i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon-like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety (among other such 'interesting and engaging' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film, none of them actually happen. no, i'm not joking...there really isn't a raging sea or a ferocious bird, it's just trying to make you interested...classic in my opinion. this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value!!
