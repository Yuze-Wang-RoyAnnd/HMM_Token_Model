peter m. cohen has a winner satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. the critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as "offensive" and "raunchy" only serves to underscore its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. it is in the tradition of what i call "reality based" satire following in the footsteps of "in the company of men," "chasing amy", "your friends and neighbors" and "two girls and a guy". cohen's dialogue is hilarious and i was continually intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations. brian van holt, zorie barber, and jonathan abrahams are three distinct, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by judah domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (amanda peet). underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products.
