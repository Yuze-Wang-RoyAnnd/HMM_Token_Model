by saying that,i mean that this is not a well made movie but it's a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so far.and if you are a ww2 buff then this is a treat for you,cause there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie. it's theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi documentary.<br /><br />me personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over-human heroes of the second world war,and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won't get forgotten by next generations.cause nowadays kids doesn't read books,they watch movies.<br /><br />so if you want a action extravaganza,rent private ryan,this is the truth about lingering pain,outrageous endurance and the will to fight when all seems lost.
