if ever anyone queries whether cinema is an art form, you can do worse than pointing them at this movie.<br /><br />quite simply it is the perfect combination of story, script, actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloid.<br /><br />the story of a doomed bomber pilot who is missed by his heavenly conductor in the english fog during the second world war, and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities (or is it in his head) is played with panache by david niven and kim hunter and is incredibly touching - especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot (niven) describes his plight to the ground radio operator (hunter).<br /><br />the sense of otherworldliness is heightened by jack cardiff's photography and the incredible production designs.<br /><br />the supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in technicolour - this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor (a fantastic marius goring).<br /><br />not only a highpoint in british cinema, but a highpoint in cinema, period.
