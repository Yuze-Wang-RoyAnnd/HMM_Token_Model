cat soup has two "hello kitty"-type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. this mind-tripping asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. there is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself. and make sure no one under 10 is in the room. dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. honest. perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. but like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end.
