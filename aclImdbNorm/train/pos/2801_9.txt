my scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when i vowed i love this film. bring on the coals; i'll walk over them as well to say again that i love "bend it like beckham." granted, there's a lot of "in spite of" in that confession. it's a bit movie-of-the-week; the screenplay is on the paint-by-numbers side. and, most troublingly, the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin.<br /><br />the film's genius is not in what's obvious to the syd field-doctored eye: character arcs, themes, construction. it's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath, but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at. powerful, sometimes semi-clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than lara croft or zhang ziyi will ever do. these are real bodies (keira knightley's excepted) whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later. they are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self-determination. and, in my book, lead actress parminder nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen
