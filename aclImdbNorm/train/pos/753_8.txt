story about four teenage girls growing up in california. jeanie (jodie foster) is the most level-headed of the bunch--but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (sally kellerman). annie (cherie currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father. madge (marilyn kagan) has overprotective parents. deirde (kandice stroh) thinks she's more mature than the rest of them.<br /><br />this is nothing new from what we've seen plenty of times before--but this one has one big difference--it's accurate. i graduated from high school in 1980 (when i first saw the film) and i was surprised at how realistic it was. they got the dialogue, clothes and attitudes down completely right. even the main song of the movie ("on the radio" by donna summer) was a big hit before this came out. this film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because i could understand and relate to the characters. i knew girls in high school who were just like this! the film is (of course) dated but it captures a time we will never see again.<br /><br />the acting is good on all counts with foster giving the best performance. the relationship between her and kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well-done. even scott baio (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) more or less realistically played a teen boy.<br /><br />a very good movie--essential viewing if you came of age in 1980. the film has a deserved r rating (plenty of drug use and swearing) but should be seen by all teens. i give it a 8.
