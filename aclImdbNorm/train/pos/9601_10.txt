darius goes west is an amazing documentary about a teenager (weems) with duchenne muscular dystrophy, and his 11 friends who take him on a cross-country trip to see if "pimp my ride" will pimp out his wheelchair.<br /><br />i recently watched this movie at the sunscreen film festival. it played twice over the course of the festival. this movie is an amazing story about the human spirit, and the spirit of weem's friends. i do not say this often about movies, but after watching this movie, i feel moved to do something towards the cause. every festival this movie has taken part in, this movie has won an award of some kind. it is in the tribeca film festival, and it is going to london and athens, greece. i would not be surprised if this movie went all the way to the academy awards. it is snowballing out of control. if anyone has a chance to see this movie, wherever it is playing, go! take as many people as possible, and go! it is heading to new orleans for a film festival, then on to atlanta and palm beach, fl. darius is from georgia, so i expect the tickets for the atlanta showing will be sold out quickly, if they are not already. please, go see this movie! dgw (talk about it)<br /><br />-kish
