this was a pretty good movie, i liked it. i thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it's not about dieting, it's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this. beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling. i also think one of the best lines in the movie is where beth yells the words, "it's not about you." to her mother. those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie. i think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.
