thomas capano was not anne marie's boss tom carper, the governor was. that is the reason the feds became involved, he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case. i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day. i also read ann rule's book and saw the "city confidential" segment on a&e. tom capano was a megalomanic(sp.), an uber-controller and a monster. he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control. when she wouldn't let him do that anymore he killed her, the ultimate form of control. i think it's a waste of money that he is still alive.
