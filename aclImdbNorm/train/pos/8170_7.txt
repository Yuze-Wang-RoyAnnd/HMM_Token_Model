as if most people didn't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry, this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm. a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man (on their anniversary of all days!) and snaps big time into a furious breakdown. after shooting an attack dog's head off, he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his "slut" of a wife. there are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and beauty queen fondling, as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen. the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch. a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail. "the dentist" is incredibly entertaining, fast-paced, and laughably gory at times. check it out!
