william wyler was to have directed this adaptation of moss hart's hit broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: george cukor. the "women's director" has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of air corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled chinese-american recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring. notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years: lon mcallister, edmond o'brien, martin ritt, red buttons (in drag, as an andrews sister), peter lind hayes, karl malden, kevin mccarthy, gary merrill, lee j. cobb, and don taylor. also for a very early glimpse of judy holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as o'brien's worried-sick brooklyn spouse. too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after twentieth century fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the pentagon. it's disingenuous and corny in spots, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and it deserves to be more widely seen.
