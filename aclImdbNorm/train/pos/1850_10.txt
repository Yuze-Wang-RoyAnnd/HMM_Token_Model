this is my favorite movie ever. i have watched it at least 10 times and i cry every time. my family begs me not to watch it so i wont have a crying fit. i think i love that it is a true story written by antwone himself just as much as i love the movie. the acting is top notch, and the actors were perfect for their role. denzel washington is one of my favorite actors. but this is my favorite movie he has done so far. i took care of a little boy who was also born in jail. he was the most precious little boy i had ever met. he has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. i saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and i am so happy he is safe and loved. and i am so happy antwone's happy and found his family.<br /><br />i would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family. i just cant say enough good things about it!!
