i saw this as a child in the late eighties and i must say, galaxy express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time. if you've never understood the appeal of anime, discovering this film may be your golden ticket to otaku-town.<br /><br />the story is as delicate and poetic as ridley scott's blade runner. the cell animation, while somewhat traditional, possesses a vivid style that explosively portrays leiji matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual storytelling.<br /><br />this is one of those unique children's films like star wars, the dark crystal and the wizard of oz that completely transcends 'family entertainment' status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms.<br /><br />i highly recommend this film.
