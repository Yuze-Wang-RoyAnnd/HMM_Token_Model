i know, i know: it's childish. but i just love this type of movie. a bird that suffered a lot of "mishaps" and still hasn't lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor. what's special about this film is the fact that the main character is paulie -the parrot- and he's not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor. furthermore i like the storyline: paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom. (by the way: jay mohr's voice almost sounds like joe pesci's!). and cheech marin of course, the man is humor to me. ever since i saw "up in smoke" i have appreciated his naive way of performing, making a simple situation a hilarious one.. can't help myself.
