this movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that i have ever seen. i am not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience. one suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to life.<br /><br />i must admit that when i first heard about this movie i was sceptical. i thought the plot sounded contrived and i was afraid that the story would be banal. but being a david lynch fan i decided to give it a go. it took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie, but then i was completely lost in it. there is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! i left the cinema feeling that i had truly learned something valuable about life.<br /><br />this is not a typical david lynch movie, and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years. on the other hand, i am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because i also thought he managed that very well in the elephant man. lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and i think the straight story is his best yet. 9.5/10
