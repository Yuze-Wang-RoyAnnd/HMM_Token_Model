first a quick 'shut up!' to those saying this movie stinks. you can't go to every movie expecting 'citizen kane'. this was actually a fun movie. jason lee is good in everything he does. the only flaw in this movie is, i don't think there was enough chemestry between lee and julia stiles. they should have dwelled more on that. other than that, the movie is good fun. selma blair needs to eat something. she's worrying me. but she still looks beautiful. so yes, i recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun. go see.<br /><br />rating: **1/2 out of ****
