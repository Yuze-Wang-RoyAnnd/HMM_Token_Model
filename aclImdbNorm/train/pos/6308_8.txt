silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable.<br /><br />a group of down-and-outs team up with a "seasoned" crook to elevate themselves out of their poverty. great idea...if you ignore the screwup factor.<br /><br />nice to see george clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change. the casting is perfect and the acting standards very high. although it could be said that the motley crew subject isn't new, i think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way. sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone before.<br /><br />very well done guys.
