i first saw this movie at a festival. there were many good movies, but few kept me thinking about it long after, and an insomniac's nightmare was definitely one of them. tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker. the shots were great. casting was perfect. dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted. there wasn't a lot to know about his character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him. and ellen-- i can't wait to see where she ends up! she's showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films. with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill, tess shows that it's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors. kudos to everyone involved with this film. and thanks to tess and co. for distributing it on dvd!
