most hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience of teenagers. this film demonstrates exactly how to do it right. it combines elements of humour, suffering, rebellion, etc. in a way that is comlex & sympathetic. the ending could be a bit clearer, but the fact that the director doesn't spell everything out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes a more intelligent viewer.
