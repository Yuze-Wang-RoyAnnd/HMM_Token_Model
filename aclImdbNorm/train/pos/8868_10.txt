i have to say that higher learning is one of the top 3 movies i have ever watched. it has a brilliant cast, and an equally brilliant director. singleton shows how life in university can be. there are 3 main story lines, the skinheads, the african-americans, and the homosexuals. i was intrigued by all of the stories, but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about kristen, battling her feelings towards another girl. the end was great. after seeing the movie 25 times plus, i still cry. i would have given this movie an 11, but i have to settlefor 10/10.
