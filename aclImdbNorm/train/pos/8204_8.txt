sudden impact was overall better than the enforcer in my opinion. it was building up to be a great movie, but then i saw the villain(s) and was disappointed.<br /><br />sudden impact was different than the previous installments. the plot went a different direction in this movie, as dirty harry doesn't take as much of a police approach this time around. we also don't see the villain(s) until later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for us all.<br /><br />clint eastwood once again steals the show as dirty harry, enough said. pat hingle was enjoyable as chief jannings, harry's new assigned boss. bradford dillman seemed to change his name to captain briggs here, either way, he wasn't any different. michael currie is decent as lt. donnelly, harry's annoying superior. i personally enjoyed kevyn major howard as hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against harry. albert popwell was excellent as horace, harry's buddy. audrie j. neenan was good as ray parkins, a famous lesbian around town. jack thibeau was well cast as kruger, a pervert. now for the really bad part. sandra locke, eastwood's long-time lover was horribly miscast as jennifer spencer, harry's love interest. and paul drake was just horrible as mick.<br /><br />the movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts.<br /><br />8/10.
