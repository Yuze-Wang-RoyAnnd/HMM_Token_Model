j"org buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times, even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify. they are artistically made, with also often deeper meaning to its themes. this movie is a perfect example of his work.<br /><br />it's also really hard to label this movie. it's not really a movie with a story to it, in a sense of having a beginning, middle and end in it. it also doesn't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings, on 7 different days.<br /><br />all different stories are being told with lots of class, though some of them are of course more 'interesting' and realistic than the others. they are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story. the movie doesn't feel disjointed at all. all different stories have a different feel to it and buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words (also typical for his style) but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story. it helps to make this movie an effective one to watch.<br /><br />again, the production values all aren't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people. it however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes.<br /><br />a buttgereit movie that i 'enjoyed' watching.<br /><br />7/10
