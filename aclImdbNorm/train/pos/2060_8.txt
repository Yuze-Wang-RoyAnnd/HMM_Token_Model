this movie is not your typical horror movie. it has some campy humor and death scenes which can be sort of comical. i personally liked the movie because of its off-beat humor. it's definetely not a super scary movie, which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid afterwards. i liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of lester... very believable. i think i'm going to dye my hair red like that girl in scarecrow- very cool! anyway, overall worth renting for the campy humor and non typical horror experience.
