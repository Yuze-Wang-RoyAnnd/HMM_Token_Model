i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year. i was enthralled and entertained. it has all the elements of what i love to see in a sci-fi story, in a book or on the screen. there's social commentary, speculation, and a good story.<br /><br />there's something eerie, and amusing, watching a 1936 view of the 'distant future' of the 60s and 70s.<br /><br />i think it's a must see, and not only for sci-fiers.
