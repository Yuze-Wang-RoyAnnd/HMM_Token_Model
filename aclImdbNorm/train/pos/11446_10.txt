right at this moment i am watching this movie for the second time (on television) and for the second time i fell into it when it was running for an hour already (i think i saw 2 minutes more this time) this movie is really impressing, the way goldsworthy looks at nature, changes nature in a way that you yourself would never think of, really is amazing. this whole movie gives you a warm feeling, seeing him play with the world around him with such love. or only seeing his hands, covered in dirt and with broken fingernails, it just touches you.
