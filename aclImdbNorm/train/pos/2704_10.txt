i've been disappointed, if not surprised, at the lack of appreciation this film has received. once again, billy zane proves he's more than just a hollywood pretty boy in a silent performance that combines spastic slapstick with understated pathos. calling this a silent film is inaccurate, as there's a lot of music and sound. it has a manic pace and is full of the goofy inventiveness that ed wood is finally beginning to be appreciated for. look at the cast listing, and realize that everyone shines. no one is there just to show their face. i believe they're all in the movie to show their appreciation of wood, and to do a broad, physical kind of acting not seen much these days.<br /><br />but, today, reviewers try to guess what's going to become a hit much more than they show any kind of esthetic appreciation for a movie. and iwuetdid has no discernable target audience. it was made mostly out of love for wood's script. even after his death, the trendy social parasites have dealt him another serious blow, and deprived the world of a minor classic. this is a highly entertaining and a genuinely experimental film that really deserves to live, at least on dvd.
