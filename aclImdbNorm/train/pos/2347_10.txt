i have been a fan of pushing daisies since the very beginning. it is wonderfully thought up, and bryan fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show.<br /><br />it is unbelievable on how much tv has been needing a creative, original show like pushing daisies. it is a huge relief to see a show, that is unlike the rest, where as, if you compared it to some of the newer shows, such as scrubs and house, you would see the similarities, and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity.<br /><br />with a magnificent cast, wonderful script, and hilarity in every episode, pushing daisies is, by-far, one of the most remarkable shows on your television.
