michael jackson is not very popular in usa anymore, however in europe (especially germany) he has still got lots of fans. many will say that this is a bad movie, and it is: it has no plot, it's full of cliches, michael praises himself constantly.<br /><br />but, you can't expect a plot or non-cliches in this kind of movie! it has entertaining visual effects and the music is perfect. the smooth criminal fragment - the greatest song ever, full of moonwalks, group dance acts and even the famous "michael jackson's bench-over" - makes this film one of jackson's masterpieces with an even good-looking (and white...) michael jackson!<br /><br />a must for jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for dance act fans.<br /><br />however, as i'm an mj fan, i should warn all michael jackson haters out there: don't watch this movie, you'd only make your hate increase...
