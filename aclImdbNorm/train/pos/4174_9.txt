... when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary.<br /><br />although few lines, it was kind of weird to see this movie, no subs, in a language unknown. a friend of mine sent a vhs, included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated to english. with her translation next to me, i began watching this tale (it is indeed a tale), and from the very first tunes of the whistling melody during opening credits i was stuck. the colours, that minimal acting (well, in most cases), absurd comedy, slapstick, thoughtful, beautiful... along with a few other movies (paris, texas and nenette et boni), this one is able to speak to anyone's heart - without words. whenever you get the chance, see it. whatever you do - don't miss it. it's a once in a lifetime experience. oh, acting is great, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) like this.
