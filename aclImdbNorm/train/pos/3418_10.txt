the hip hop rendition of a mos def performance (according to the film's musical credits)...it is an incredible piece of savage consciousness that slams the violence in your heart with each "snap" if anyone can tell me someplace this song, "live wire snap" by mos def from "the ground truth", an undeniable duty to see as the americans who might not support the mission but embrace each soul caught inside this savage miscalculation of purpose...they take on the haunting as so many of us can sit back and be angry...<br /><br />"live wire snap" by mos def, where can it be found<br /><br />desperate to find it :<br /><br />medically unable to serve
