if you think "weird al" yankovic is hilarious, you won't be disappointed by the compleat al. not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of yankovic's more memorable videos ("like a surgeon" and "i love rocky road" among them), but they are inter-spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame. yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be lightly amused. die-hard fans will love it not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look into yankovic's now nearly three decade career. suitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals.
