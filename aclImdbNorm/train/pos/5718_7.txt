i wanted to see sarah buffy on the big screen, so i first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at imdb. i worried about seeing a bad movie. well, i had fun watching the movie. some parts, which obviously were meant to be scary, were actually quite humoristic, almost as in buffy the vampire slayer.<br /><br />i don't consider this a bad movie. it's not a great movie either. just a rather well made horror movie. it does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. in my opinion, the acting was ok. sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. the other actors were definitely not bad either, i liked yoko.<br /><br />the sets are nice (and i don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the japanese original).<br /><br />the scary moments were often predictable. but not always. i have seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. nice.<br /><br />the movie had some nice scenes that were almost original, like the trails of rubbish, the simple special effects for he ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat that made eery noises, the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother.<br /><br />don't go if you want to see sarah in another buffy episode, because it is very different from her buffy work, much more serious. don't go if you only want to see movies that gather oscar nominations. it's a good horror movie, enough suspense. i gave it a 7.
