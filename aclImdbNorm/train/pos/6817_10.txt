i love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie b/c of the real meaning of family in it, the history of our country, the fun-filled action displayed in the movie. i watch time @ the top about 4 x's a week and i just love it! i wish that a sequel had of been made to see more of susan's dad in the past and watching how susan delt with her new baby sister and having no telephone, computers, gameboys or anything of the 21st century. i hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as i did i guess you could say i'm a time at the top fanatic and i don't mind. the lil boy in the movie robert lincoln walker was simply adorible i wonder who he is and how old he is today. does anyone know if he's played in over movies or tv shows?
