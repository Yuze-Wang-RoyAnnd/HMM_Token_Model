gojoe takes a little getting used to at first, but the final result is very satisfying. the tale, about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate, but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. there is a lot at stake here, from physical survival to soulful salvation. the movie may seem a bit similar to other anime-inspired samurai film at first, but it does eventually delve into more mature/adult territory soon after.<br /><br />not to be missed. gojoe is one of the better samurai movies to come around post-kurosawa.<br /><br />8 out of 10<br /><br />(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films)
