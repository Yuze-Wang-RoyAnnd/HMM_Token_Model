getting to work on this film when it was made back in the summer of 1990. shot partly in the biltmore estate in asheville, nc and the remaining parts in winston-salem. the massive offices of the rj reynolds were used in several office scenes and places in around the beautiful city that is know as the tulip capital of the world winston-salem! i enjoyed my work although it was exceedingly hard work building all the sets like the golf of mexico where renee russo and jim belushi went on their date. i also had a big hand in decorating the bar where larry encounters the magical bartender mr. destiny. i tacked all those pics on the wall of sports heroes and decorated that phone booth where larry makes a phone call for a cab. i even put my mothers photo at eye level so i could freeze frame it and show it to her when we watched it. i remember dyeing the grass at his old house with green dye because it first had to be sodded(it was a new house in a new development and i guess they leased it for the movie)..then i had to cut that newly laid sod to make it look nice..man that was hard! as far as the movie, when we made it we had no idea what it would be like but after seeing it i fell in love with it because really tells the story of "what if" as good as i ever had seen it, including the great it's a wonderful life. i cried so many times<br /><br />i can't count. i got to meet the wonderful actor michael caine while shooting scenes at an old minor league ballpark where larry's boyhood scenes were played and replayed. i remember after he had done a take an was heading back to his trailer, i ran him down and asked him for a picture and he was quite amiable and said "why not!" he is a good guy and a really natural and forceful actor. i can't say the same for jim belushi..he was so full of himself, smoking big cuban cigars and talking loudly so<br /><br />everyone in earshot could hear his every word. his career never did take off but he has had a decent tv career recently. i would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance. it's wonderful and really heartfelt and real. you can feel larry's pain after he enters into the new world mr. destiny gives him after hitting the homer, and as he wants so badly for people to believe he is not this bad guy everyone thinks he is. they all think he belongs in a nuthouse! but eventually he wins people over but by then he wants his real life back so badly, especially his wonderful wife, played so beautifully by linda hamilton..and he wants his dog back! so see it.
