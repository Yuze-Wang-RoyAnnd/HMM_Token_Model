plot is never the strong point of a fred astaire and ginger rogers movie, but "follow the fleet"'s screenplay is exceptionally mediocre. fred and ginger still come off all right--they play "bake" baker and sherry martin, dancers whose personal and professional partnership ended when bake joined the navy. when they meet again, their love-hate relationship generates some entertaining comic moments. but for much of the movie, they take a backseat to a tedious subplot about sherry's sister connie (harriet hilliard), her love for sailor bilge smith (randolph scott), bilge's dalliance with another woman, and an old schooner that connie inherited from her father. though hilliard is rather charming, this plot is uninteresting.<br /><br />but at the same time, "follow the fleet" is blessed with an exceptional irving berlin score that gives the stars plenty of chances to show off their talents. astaire gets two good solos with "we saw the sea" and "i'd rather lead a band." he sings expressively and, of course, dances electrifyingly--and the sailor suit makes him look a little more boyish and athletic than usual. rogers sings the catchy "let yourself go" and later does a solo tap-dance to the same tune. <br /><br />the three duets really save the film, even though they're all shoehorned into the plot with silly excuses. fred and ginger win a dance contest by doing an energetic routine to another reprise of "let yourself go". later, they sing and dance "i'm putting all my eggs in one basket" as if it were an early rehearsal of the number, flubbing the choreography to comic effect. at the end, the movie finally figures out how to get fred and ginger in evening clothes for a romantic duet--it makes it part of a show-within-the-show. the situation is contrived, but the song, "let's face the music and dance", is one of the most sinuously beautiful things berlin ever wrote (it's reminiscent of cole porter), and the dancing matches it in elegance. quintessential astaire and rogers.<br /><br />it would be a chore to sit through most of the dialogue sections of "follow the fleet" again, and, in fact, it's not necessary, because the plot rarely propels the musical numbers. but i could watch the songs over and over.
