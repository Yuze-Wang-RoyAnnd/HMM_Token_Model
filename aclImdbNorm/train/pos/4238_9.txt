on the surface, this is an above-average post-war romantic comedy. beneath the veneer, it is mgm character actor stunt-casting at its funniest.<br /><br />the leads are straightforward, but all the secondaries are cast much against type. margaret hamilton (aka wicked witch of the west), edward everett horton (professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget), and sig ruman (the marx brothers' nemesis in _night in casablanca_ and the always-wonderful _night at the opera_), playing a well-intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together, instead of driving them apart as their "usual" characters would do.<br /><br />it also pokes fun at many romantic-comedy conventions, which is another indication that this could be not so much a "straight" romantic comedy, as it is a wry send-up of the many post-war romantic comedies & their 2-dimensional, stock characters.<br /><br />i've seen it only once, with interruptions, so i can't be positive, but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made, but is less successful now that viewers "see" these secondary characters through a completely different lens. i'm assuming this is the case when i give it 9 stars. i thought it was hysterical.
