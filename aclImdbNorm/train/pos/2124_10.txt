this is a truly classic movie in its story, acting, and film presentation. wonderful actors are replete throughout the whole movie, miss sullivan, and jimmy stewart being the foremost characters. in real life she greatly admired, and liked jimmy, and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles, and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set. the "chemistry" between the two was always apparent, and so warm and enjoyable to behold. she was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality portrayals. the story of these two young people, and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch, and pure magical entertainment. heart warming presentations are also given by the other supporting actors in this marvelous story/movie. i whole heartily give miss sullivan a perfect 10 in this golden age cinema classic, that has a special appeal for all generations. a must see for all!
