i can remember watching this for the first time, when i was 9 years old. i wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". this movie is still great. one original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short. implying that the "barbarian brothers" where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly! plus, you have chases, a cage fight, a dragon, and yes even a bar brawl! <br /><br />yes, the acting is bad so that's why it's not a ten, also the story line has received a lot of criticism. i think it is quite original. not to many movies in it's genre have the same original story lines, or colorful dialogue. <br /><br />i definitely recommend this film.
