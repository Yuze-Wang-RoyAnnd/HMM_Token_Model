generally, i am not a huge fan of stop-motion films and at first ruka didn't capture my attention. however, knowing that this film was made in the repressive czechoslovakia during the soviet-domination era, the more i watched the film, the more i realized just how subversive this innocent looking little film was. this subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statement.<br /><br />the sad little film is done without any dialog, but it's pretty clear what is happening. a cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a meddling animated hand appears and destroys the pot--making it into a sculpture of a hand instead. well, the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing. however, over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually cages the man. and, by the end, the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand, in a sign of real hypocrisy, gives the man a hero's funeral! <br /><br />as i said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave jir'i trnka to criticize his domineering government. not surprisingly, though czechs loved the film and gave it critical praise, the state (i.e., the hand) banned this little parable. sadly, trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the co-called "velvet revolution".
