when i first saw this movie i was with my dad. he encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. after watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites. <br /><br />a river runs through it is about two brothers who each take a different path in life. norman maclean (craig sheffer) is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education. paul maclean (brad pitt) is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. the movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path.<br /><br />there is no downside to this movie. you will be entertained the whole way through. the acting, directing, and script is all perfect. the two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score. both of which entrap you in the world robert redford creates for you. <br /><br />this is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic. it sure is in my book. if you haven't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever.
