when i saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen. its greatness held my attention to such an extent that i focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration. i would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime, but to anyone who likes great movies period (or who likes really weird stuff). the style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism within it is breathtaking. i've heard complaints about the weird insertion of english text in the movie, but i think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie. the self-attributed description of "hello kitty on acid" doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions. i'd like to find more works by whoever made this, and see them.
