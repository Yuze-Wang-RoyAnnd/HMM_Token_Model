sydney lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still got game! a few years ago he shot "find me guilty", a proof to everyone that vin diesel can actually act, if he gets the opportunity and the right director. if he had retired after this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one could have blamed him. but he's still going strong, his next movie already announced for 2009.<br /><br />but let's stay with this movie right here. the cast list is incredible, their performance top notch. the little nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogue and/or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing. the (time) structure of the movie, that keeps your toes the whole time, blending time-lines so seamlessly, that the editing seems natural/flawless. the story is heightened by that, although even in a "normal" time structure, it would've been at least a good movie (drama/thriller). i can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! :o)
