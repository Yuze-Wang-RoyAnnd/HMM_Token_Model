in a series chock-full of brilliant episodes, this one stands out as one of my very favorites. it's not the most profound episode, there's no great meaning or message. but it's a lot of fun, and there are some fine performances.<br /><br />but what makes it really stand out for me is that it is, to my knowledge, the *only* twilight zone episode with a *double* snapper ending. the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story. but this time, you get a surprise, and think that's that, but it turns out there's *another* surprise waiting. i just like that so much, that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other being a deeper, more message-oriented one).
