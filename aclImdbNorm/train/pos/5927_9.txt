stephen king movies are a funny thing with me. i either really love them or i loathe them. some of the fancier productions (such as desperation and storm of the century) i didn't enjoy. some of the smaller ones, i really loved. sleepwalkers is one that i really do enjoy and watch it regularly.<br /><br />the story revolves around charles brady and his mother mary. they are sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature. they are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. when they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when charles finds one, he actually falls for her,but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. the story revolves around what will happen with the girl. will charles spare her or use her to save his mother.<br /><br />although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake. like most stephen king stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. the acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption.<br /><br />for uk readers: this production has most recently been shown on bbc1, sci-fi and sky thriller/horror channels.
