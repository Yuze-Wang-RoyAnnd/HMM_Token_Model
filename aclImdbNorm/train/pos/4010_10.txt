in my mind, this remains one of the very best depictions of superman on tv, as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period.<br /><br />this series paid homage to both the superman films of the '70s/'80s and the superman comics series "reboot" of 1986-onward ("man of steel," "superman vol 2," "action comics," "adventures of superman," etc). the opening score and titles were stirring, based on the john williams score from the films, updated for a saturday morning action series. marv wolfman, one of the main contributors to the comics reboot (writer of "adventures of superman") was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series. overall, the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kid-friendly.<br /><br />superman was presented as believable, strong, and iconic. his recurring nemesis was lex luthor in his megalomaniac/ceo incarnation. the daily planet characters lois, jimmy, and perry were portrayed well. one of my favorite appearances was by wonder woman, and the story revolved around her home island of themyscira ("paradise island"). both her design and that of her mother hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted wonder woman comic book series of the era, and it seemed like an equally well-done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same.<br /><br />the one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on dvd/blu-ray! it deserves to be.
