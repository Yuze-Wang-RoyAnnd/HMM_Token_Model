todd rohal is a mad genius. "knuckleface jones", his third, and most fully realized, short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads. what the film is about at heart, and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this, is how a regular joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration. or not. you just have to see for yourself. the short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit, so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can - you'll be glad you did. it is hilarious. and check out todd's other short films also popping up here and there from time to time: "single spaced" and "slug 660".
