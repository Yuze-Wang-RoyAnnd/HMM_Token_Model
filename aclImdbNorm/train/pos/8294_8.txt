this movie has great fight scenes. now its true that the acting is a little rough. but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty. but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix. then watch this. now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li p**s his pants. and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire.
