first off, if you're planning on watching this, make sure to watch the uncut version (although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship), it makes a huge difference. this film is about a young woman, played by barbara stanwyck, who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father. when her father suddenly passes away, she is able to go out into the world on her own. after reading about nietzsche's philosophies on life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love. throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all. overall, baby face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film. while no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen, it is very obvious what is happening off camera.<br /><br />i enjoyed watching this film very much and i believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it, especially with the films shock value. i did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts, but i think that about most movies the first time is see them. actually, i think that almost all movies i've seen made from the early 30's had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didn't quite "flow" right. this was probably just the craft of film-making wasn't quite perfected yet
