this movie started slowly, then gained momentum towards the middle. however, the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that momentum at its peak. the second part really got interesting, but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending. playing football in the yard? really, could it get any more sappy and maudlin? now i hear plans for a similar movie based on the '70s. i won't make any great efforts to tune into that one if it's anything like "the '60s."
