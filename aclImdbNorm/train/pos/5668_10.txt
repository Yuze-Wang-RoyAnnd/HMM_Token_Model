i stumbled on this series rather by accident. after half an episode, i was hooked. american gothic was a dark, strange series with gary cole as the mysterious, probably evil sheriff buck who is trying to gain control of his illegitimate son caleb, played by lucas black. i was impressed with gary cole's sinister sheriff and i was even more impressed with lucas black. lucas black's caleb was able to stand up against sheriff buck, one of the most frightening characters ever created for a tv series. i have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as lucas black. if you were not lucky enough to see lucas in american gothic, see him in slingblade.<br /><br />it was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during it's short run.
