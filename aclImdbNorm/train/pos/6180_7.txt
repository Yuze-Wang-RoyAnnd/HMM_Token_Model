during the opening night of the vanties a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage. as the show continues the police attempt to piece together who killed who and why before the final curtain.<br /><br />i had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so i was excited to find myself a copy. unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers which go on and on and on. while the numbers certainly are the type that hollywood did in their glory days, they become intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite attempts to weave action around them. this wouldn't be so bad if the music was half way decent, but its not. there is only one good song. worse its as if the studio knew they had one song, cocktails for two, and we're forced to endure four versions of it: a duet, a big production number, as the vanities finale and in the background as incidental music. i don't think spike jones and his city slickers ever played it that much. the rest of the movie is pretty good with victor mclaglen sparring nicely with jack oakie. charles middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistress.<br /><br />by no mean essential i can recommend this if you think you can get through the musical numbers, or are willing to scan through them. its a fun movie of the sort they don't make any more.
