paulie was cute, cool, enjoyable and quite fulfilling. i went to this movie expecting to view a typical "family" movie, one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor. my mindframe immediately changed when i was quickly captivated by the movie's wholesomeness. it is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined "wholesome". most are cheaply made, written and produced purely to attract young family members, who'll then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plots.<br /><br />oh yes, paulie had a plot. it told the story of a young girl(marie) and her best friend paulie the parrot, who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her. marie's dorky jerk father found this unbelievable, and thought paulie to be damaging to his 4-year old daughter's mental health, and quickly tore them apart. we follow paulie's adventures (and misadventures) as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters along the way. oh yeah, paulie really could (smart)talk and had a swift new jersey accent. cool. the plot held thick and entertaining throughout, keeping me attracted. paulie is the best family movie i have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed. ever. seriously. pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie, with the whole family. no sleeping. i promise.
