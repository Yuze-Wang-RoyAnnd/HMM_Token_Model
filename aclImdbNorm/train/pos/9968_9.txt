my mother took me to see this film as a child and i long to see it every year as i do all of my other christmas favorites. what i remember most was the silly devil and santa looking through his telescope. i waited and looked through the t.v. guide each year after that to see when it would be shown. i would usually find it playing on a saturday afternoon. i only found the movie in english which took something special away from the film and have longed to find a copy of it in spanish. i hold this film dear to my heart and have never suffered from nightmares as others might suggest. yes, it is a different film about santa claus and that is what makes it special and unique. i can't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children as i explain to them my favorite parts and memories!!
