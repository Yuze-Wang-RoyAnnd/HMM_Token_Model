i saw true crime when it was first released back in the mid-nineties and i have watched it many times since. it is a great mystery about mary (played by alicia silverstone), a high school senior in a california town who's classmate's younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer. mary meets tony (played by kevin dillon), a police cadet who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer.<br /><br />many suspects in this one. true crime feels very "true" or real to me. i read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true. alicia silverstone is perfect in this role and kevin dillon and bill nunn do a great job, as do the other actors. the locations are right on and the writer/director, pat verducci, really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of mary's loneliness (see the scene where mary awakens from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of tony). i wish verducci would make more movies.<br /><br />i have not seen any other movie quite like true crime. 10/10
