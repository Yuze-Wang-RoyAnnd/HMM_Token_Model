i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written. its not just about entertainment. there's tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across. and yes, it might be confusing to some of you(especially if you didn't watch sepet and/or gubra for 76 times).<br /><br />i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? its really ironic how the characters relate. like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra. and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /><br />and i absolutely love the voice-overs. its crude yet awakeningly fresh. like, when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard, then there was suddenly mukhsin's voice saying 'bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..' (the scene when he climbed the tree).<br /><br />it captured malaysian's attitude(and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is) portrayed in the character. for example, even the kids can be really sharp tongued(complete with the shrill annoying voice) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur own life isn't sorted out. <br /><br />all i can say is, this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it. <br /><br />it kept me glued to the screen, i couldn't even take my eyes off it. not even to make out in the cinema. ha ha.
