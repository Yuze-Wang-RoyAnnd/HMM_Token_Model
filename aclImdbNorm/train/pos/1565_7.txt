i've just seen the saint strikes back for the first time and found it quite good. this was george sanders's first appearance as the saint, where he replaces louis hayward.<br /><br />in this one, the saint is sent to san francisco to investigate a shooting at a night club. with the help of his acquaintance inspector fernack who has come down from new york, they help a daughter of a crime boss.<br /><br />joining sanders in the cast are wendy barrie and jonathan hale.<br /><br />not a bad saint movie. worth seeing.<br /><br />rating: 3 stars out of 5.
