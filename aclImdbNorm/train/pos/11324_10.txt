i have to agree with everyone else that has posted.<br /><br />i watched it quite a while ago but i'll tell you, whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling i got when watching it, and it does make me cry(such a happy yet sad feeling). i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience.<br /><br />i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research(and watch the ending a few more times) and i found all my answers and a whole lot more. i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime, it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more.(i've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime)<br /><br />i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely. i'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story, well built characters(some mysterious)and a bit of fantasy action.<br /><br />also, even though this was based on a h-game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way.(i have no problem with mature anime, in most cases i prefer it)
