i have to agree with most of the other posts. was it a comedy? a drama? to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side. i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived. jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name. in new york, how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland.and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold. again, a comedy or drama? but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning. i enjoyed kimberly elise's performance, she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously. she is a younger actress that is going to be viable.
