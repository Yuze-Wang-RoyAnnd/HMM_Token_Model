ok, so it may not be the award-winning "movie of the year" type-film (apart from the brilliant soundtrack that i think won a few awards), but it is a really great film about 'the kid' (prince / o( take your pick) and the happenings around him living in minneapolis, playing his music. the music is absolutely superb, in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack, it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion. and the movie itself plays out a nice plot, it's worth seeing over and over again, espeically if you like prince / o (which i do) of course.
