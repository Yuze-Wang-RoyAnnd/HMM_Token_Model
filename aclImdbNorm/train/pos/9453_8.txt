deliverance is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by james dickey, turned into a brilliant movie by john boorman. it's about four businessmen, driven by manhood and macho-behavior, who're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains. up there, they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery...poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! these four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land, completely estranged from all forms of civilisation. all these elements actually make deliverance one of the most nightmarish films i've ever seen. just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation. pure talking cinema, deliverance is a very important movie as well. john boorman's best (closely followed by zardoz and excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies. just think about the terrific "duelling banjos" musical score and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual "squeal like a pig" rape scene. all the actors deliver (haha) perfect acting performances. especially jon voight. a must see motion picture!!
