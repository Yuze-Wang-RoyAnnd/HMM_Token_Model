i was drawn to this movie the moment i saw a preview of it on oscar night. when i read about kay pollak, i was hooked. we americans are suckers for a comeback kid.<br /><br />i understand this movie was a huge draw in sweden. as a very provincial american i can only speculate on the reason. perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which i believe has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societies.<br /><br />the message of this movie for me is the same as the movie titanic. life is short people and as far as anyone really knows it's all we've got. it can be taken away at any time. so isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because we're so afraid of being hurt? tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls. feeling alive is worth taking the risk. give and you will receive. so start living now.<br /><br />many people are criticizing this movie for it's lack of characterization and other flaws. i say you are all pseudo-sophisticated. get a grip folks, it's a parable, a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject poverty.<br /><br />so join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you. spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and commune with your fellow man. writing a check is not enough. we are a social species by the way. even the humblest of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought possible.<br /><br />rugged individualism has its place but it is over-rated.
