lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to miami. she ends up sitting next to an assassin named jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies. the reason she has to switch the room is because jackson wants to blow it up.<br /><br />it's a great suspense movie because lisa tries several ways to escape this ploy that jackson has set up. the whole storyline is great and i thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane. there could have more to the plane but other than that, the whole movie was pretty good.<br /><br />i especially liked the ending because it was heart-stopping. i didn't know what was going to happen and i was surprised by it. for me, this movie just took off.
