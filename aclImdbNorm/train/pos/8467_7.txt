i liked this movie because it basically did more with less. it could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more (though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop).<br /><br />the guy playing the dj did a good job of showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories. i also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny.<br /><br />while parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away, other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did.<br /><br />i thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part, concentrating more on the living side of the equation. the last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed.<br /><br />while it was a shorter movie, it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story. any more and it would have started to drag.
