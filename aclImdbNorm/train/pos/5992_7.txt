i admit i had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece. it could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all i knew. it began with great visuals, little snippets to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild. as it continued i learned quickly through voice overs what was taking place. a nice little neo noir story that i felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time. the little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment as they piece together the plot. along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall. the score, though not bad, gave the film almost a music video feel. it just felt a little dated, not adding anything to further the storyline. some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece. i walk away from this very satisfied. i was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice-over work it didn't feel rushed or pushed. great job!
