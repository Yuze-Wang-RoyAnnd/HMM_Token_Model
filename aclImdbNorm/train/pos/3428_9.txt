i saw this film tonight in nyc at the landmark sunshine. i didn't know what to expect, i'd not read much about it as i knew i would see it no matter what. all in all, it is very well done. it doesn't focus on the generalization of "anti-war" statements, which to me, left the politics out of it. the soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp, and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life. it was really good to see paul rieckhoff and camilo mejia tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war, but refusing the command to go back when it was against personal morals. make no mistake - this is not an anti-war film. anyone who says it is hasn't seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls.
