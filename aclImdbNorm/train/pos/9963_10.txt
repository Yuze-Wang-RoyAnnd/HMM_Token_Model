i saw this movie when i was a little girl. and i have enjoyed it every time. sure the graphics are a little cheesy, compared to now, but back in the 70's it was great. i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful. that was how i remember my christmases were with my family - magical. santa claus was amazing and i couldn't wait for him to come back each year.<br /><br />if you have a child/children and speak spanish, bring them up watching this old fashioned version of "santa claus". it's a different version than we are used to today, but who says there is one way?<br /><br />it's a fun movie to watch. it teaches children good vs. bad. i don't know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this, but the spanish is the best. enjoy and happy holidays! feliz navidad!
