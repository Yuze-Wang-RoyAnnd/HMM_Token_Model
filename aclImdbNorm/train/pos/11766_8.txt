this movie has everything you want from an action movie. explosions,shootouts,bad guys and worse guys. it is fun to see james belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollars from the ultimate big boss "the skipper. does this sounds cheesy. of course it is. but boy,did i have fun watching this movie. it is a whole lot better than all the direct to dvd garbage that is made nowadays. if you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store. you could argue about the twists being predictable. but the fast pace of this movie doesn't give you time too think too much of them,which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist. but more about the journey to that moment. only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie. they probably expected a movie about mobsters in stead of some crooks double crossing each other. pure fun!
