"hot millions" is a well-written, well-acted tale about an embezzler who steals (whoops! -- too low class a word for an embezzler, according to peter ustinov's lead character) a "hot million" from the london branch of a u.s. corporation by creating shell corporations on the continent and using the firm's ostensibly secure computer to transfer funds to them. (remember, spoiler police, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) <br /><br />from 1968, this movie's depiction of computers may seem naive to today's more computer-literate populace; but as one who has worked with computers since before this film was released, i would assert that even then, this smacks of having been written by and for computer illiterates, probably on purpose to heighten the droll comedic aspects of this british flick. <br /><br />if one has little taste for this type of entertainment, the movie may seem to drag in spots. fortunately, it has a nicely wrapped-up ending; unfortunately, the end credits give no indication of the classical music used therein -- the symphonic piece at the end and the piano-flute duet in the middle -- just the song sung by lulu which i totally don't remember.
