i have to start off by apologizing because i thought the first 75-80% of this film was hilarious. it's mostly because of brad pitt's performance. spot on.<br /><br />the acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie. the atmosphere was perfect in all respects. i'm not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever.<br /><br />brutal,honest,gritty. all good words to describe this movie.<br /><br />i was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind early's violence isn't explained. it is explained but they thankfully don't have to go into graphic detail to get their point across.<br /><br />overall i gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. underrated.
