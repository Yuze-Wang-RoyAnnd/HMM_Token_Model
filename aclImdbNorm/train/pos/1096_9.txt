i first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot. after many subsequent viewings (and purchase of the video) it still makes me laugh out loud.<br /><br />yes, it's a relic of another age - a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class america - but well executed is well executed. but it's also a document of its age - a celebration of post-war optimism, the baby boom and the nascent consumer age. this film is no "guilty" pleasure.<br /><br />three wonderful sophisticated leads actors - urbane melvyn douglas; bemused cary grant; daffily determined myrna loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters.<br /><br />my favourite scenes - "it means we gotta blast" and "miss stellwaggen" and "this little piggy".<br /><br />love it.
