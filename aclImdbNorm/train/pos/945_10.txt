this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine. the immortal charles dicken's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine. i admit i have not seen the classic alistair sim version and i'm sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version. i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it.<br /><br />the story is well known, i won't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another. a rich, stingy, mean, old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways. in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits, each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with, past, present and future. finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done.<br /><br />george c. scott is absolutely, undeniably perfect for this role. he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character. he is not just a mean old man, but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world. there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved. scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scrooge.<br /><br />not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place. this is a grand epic of victorian england, dickens england is recreated before our very eyes, the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market. director clive donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination. i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery. it's not spectacular scenery per se but it's real. the film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between.<br /><br />the rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life. bob cratchitt, played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony walters were wonderful. the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story. a christmas carol is not a light story. dickens wrote this story for a dark period in england's life and it's one of the few christmas tales that is really dark, almost scary, and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around. the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas miracles. the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it's the actual score or the christmas music, everything fits together. apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others. 10/10
