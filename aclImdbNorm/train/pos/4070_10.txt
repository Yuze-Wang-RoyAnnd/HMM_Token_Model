i know anime. i've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon; i loved ranma before most people knew what dragonball z even was. and just so you know i'm not bragging about my, let me say this: out of all the animes i've seen, castle in the sky is by far one of the best. it's obvious people say spirited away is the best, but i really disagree. most people only know that movie because it one an acedmy award; this isn't an exaggeration - i've shown princess mononoke and castle in the sky to people who'd only ever seen spirited away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three. personally, i'd never thought that anything could compare to princess mononoke, until i finally saw castle in the sky. i still think that the prior is the better of the two, but castle in the sky is easily on par with it; in many ways, castle has major elements that mononoke was missing. in either case, if you've only seen spirited away, and think that that is miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken.
