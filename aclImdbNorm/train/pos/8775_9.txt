excellent warner bros effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performances. it's often cited as his best, and i can't really judge fully until i have seen his "dawn patrol". however, his work in "they died with their boots on" takes some beating. i'm a big flynn fan (he's my favourite actor after james mason--it also helps that he's an aussie) and i think he's just marvellous, a great screen presence and also a great actor. he is the centrepiece of "gentleman jim" as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork, but he is also backed up by a literate, warm and funny script, and raoul walsh's direction. every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it's pace, he truly was a born film-maker. walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully, as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant, great final scene between ward bord and flynn. add to that great production values (the "gay nineties" never looked better!) and a lovely supporting cast and it's pretty much perfect entertainment. alan hale usually played flynn's sidekick, but here is his father, and it still all works. alexis smith is flynn's love interest. the pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other.
