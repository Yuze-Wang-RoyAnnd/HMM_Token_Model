walter matthau and george burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act, lewis and clark, who haven't spoken in over 10 years. burns retired and matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since. such is the premise of this hilarious neil simon play made into a movie. of course, what makes it so good is matthau and burns in their prime, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. richard benjamin shines as matthau's nephew and agent. there's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film, and character actor fritz feld starts it all off with a "pop." rosetta lanoire, who started out in the 30s in theater with orson welles and later was grandma on "family matters," is great in a small role.<br /><br />the only problem i had with it (and maybe i'm being too picky and/or serious) is the way matthau treats burns when they first meet. granted, he's had a lot of resentment festering in all these years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context. also, i'm used to seeing matthau act that way in other movies, but not to george burns. and, matthau's bellowing tends to get a little old. <br /><br />all in all, if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles, put in "the sunshine boys." they'll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life.<br /><br />benjamin: "you have to slide it." <br /><br />matthau: "wait, wait. i think you have to slide it."
