one of the best musicals ever made, this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to pick actors for their talent, rather than for what people might expect. the lighting and set are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (this has a special name that i cannot think of). the dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used. the movie is well paced, beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish. a real joy is the music. such an array of first-rate songs, from beginning to end, that are perfectly performed and orchestrated. also, the music is very original and very memorable, and i think superior to many musicals from the thirties through the sixties. it certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, that might have only two or three. not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie. another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it.
