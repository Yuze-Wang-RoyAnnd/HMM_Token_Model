the plot: a crime lord is uniting 3 different mafias in an entreprise to buy an island, that would then serve as money-laundering facility for organized crime. to thwart that, the fbi tries to bust one of the mafia lords. the thing goes wrong, and by some unlikely plot twists and turns, we are presented with another "cop buddies who don't like each other" movie... one being a female fbi agent, and the other a male ex-dea agent.<br /><br />so far, so stupid. but the strength of this movie does not lie in its story - a poor joke, at best. it is funny. (at least the synchronized german version is). the action is good, too, with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket launcher. but the focus is squarely on the humour. not intelligent satire, not quite slapstick, but somewhere in between, you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /><br />however, this film is the opposite of political correctness. legal drug abuse is featured prominently, without criticism, and even displaying it as cool. that's the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me, and renders it unsuitable for kids, in my opinion. <br /><br />all in all, for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. just remember: in this genre, it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / tv room. then you'll have a good time. 8/10
