i enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called "roxy". especially at christmas time, because there also appears a "mc santa claus".<br /><br />even if this is an old film, and even if i have videotaped it from tv, when the state movie archive of finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, i went there to check it out. it's much more enjoyable on big screen than on tv.<br /><br />even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket, i got the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video.
