i think 'blackadder the third' is the best one of the series.<br /><br />actuelly all the episodes are funny, personally i really like the episode with the 'french invasion', but the one with the superstitious actors, in 'macbeth' is also really funny, the way rowan keeps playing on with them is really (english) humor at the highest level.<br /><br />actors: 'never say that again, always call it the scottish play; blackadder: oh, so you want me to say the scottish play? actors: yes blackadder: rather than macbeth...!<br /><br />i am a big fan of rowan and i have the majority of his work, but i think he did the series of blackadder especially good.<br /><br />i hope rowan is going to continue his great style, but i think we can count on him, because he is already working on a bean 2 movie, that will be out this year, i can't wait...<br /><br />i give this 3rd blackadder a 9 out of 10 rating.
