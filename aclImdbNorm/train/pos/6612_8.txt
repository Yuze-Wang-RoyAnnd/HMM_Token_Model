just like final fantasy brought cg to a whole new level, this is a rebirth for motion capture. neither movie nor cartoon, this motion picture looks like a homage to the film noir, akira, sin city, blade runner and the new generation of european cartoonists. you see paris the way it almost could be, the characters seem as real as you and i. they blink, trip, shiver like real actors in a way never achieved before.<br /><br />don't go watch it hoping to find a mind twister. you will most likely figure it out before you're half way from the movie. the scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers, but this definitely is bliss for the eyes.
