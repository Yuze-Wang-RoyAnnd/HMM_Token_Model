this anime seriously rocked my socks. when the anime first opened itself, i felt it was too slow; the story wasn't quite moving forward, and shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead. once he learns more about tracing, and you learn more about saber and the holy grail war itself, the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together. it was fantastic.<br /><br />additionally, i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop, in the real world. there wasn't any stupid completely obvious things going on; the development of ilya and rin was interesting to watch, but i think the way shirou and saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on. a few of the "surprise" people that show up (gilgamesh?) seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another, meaning we didn't have "generic bad-ass a" being replaced by "generic bad-ass b" as soon as a died.<br /><br />anddd, i loved the music. the opening music rocked, and the finishing theme from the final episode just...seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more. good job, type-moon!
