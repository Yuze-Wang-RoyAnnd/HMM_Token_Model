this is an amazing movie from 1936. although the first hour isn't very interesting (for the modern viewer), the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterwords makes up for it. however, don't plan on being able to understand all of the dialog - the sound quality and accents (it's american - but "1930s" american) make it difficult.<br /><br />basically, the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional us town called "everytown". it spans from 1936, when a war is on the horizon, to 2036, when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems.<br /><br />the first one hour is a bit slow - although it's tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought. the events, suspense and visuals are pretty low-key in today's terms. however, when it gets to the future, it's just plain fun to watch. the large sets and retro sci-fi look of everything is hard to beat.<br /><br />unless you have great listening abilities, this movie is hard to listen to. i think i understood only 80% of the dialog. it could use closed-captioning.<br /><br />if you're a sci-fi fan, this is one of the genre's classics and is a must see (well, at least after the first hour). for the average viewer, wait until there's a closed caption version and then watch it if you're comfortable with movies of this time period.
