pandora's clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see. a highly faithful adaptation of john j. nance's novel ,which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel,is made even more so here. <br /><br />despite being made for tv, this is first rate entertainment. the cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel. richard dean anderson steps way outside the shadow of macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date. jane leeves is great her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor. daphne zuniga is great as dr. sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it works incredibly well. robert loggia, edward herrmann, robert guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter.<br /><br />there are changes to the story of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel. the plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie. the production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago, they work fine. sets are great, especially cia hq and the oval office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work.<br /><br />it doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. just do both and you won't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. this will leave you breathless.
