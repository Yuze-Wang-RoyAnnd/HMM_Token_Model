"death lends a hand" is one of the pivotal early episodes of "columbo" that helped define the show for the next thirty years. it marks the first of robert culp's four appearances (three as a murderer), playing much the same role in each show.<br /><br />in this case culp plays brimmer, the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate, mr kennicut, is having an affair. although she is, brimmer decides not to tell kennicut, in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husband's business associates. she reacts badly to this suggestion, an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as brimmer whacks her across the face. because he is wearing a large ring, the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her.<br /><br />there are some really priceless moments in this episode. one of my favourite scenes is where columbo pretends to be into palm-reading, although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of brimmer's ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring. columbo being columbo, he only reveals what he really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little. so initially he goofily plays the part of a rather simple-minded man who gets excited by the "lifeline going over the mound of the moon", or some equally ridiculous palm-reading mumbo-jumbo.<br /><br />another great scene is when brimmer tries to offer columbo a job for his firm, effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose around. again, columbo doesn't reveal that he knows what's going on, he pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer.<br /><br />and there's another where columbo says to kennicut, in front of brimmer, that he wishes the murderer could hear their conversation. he wants to hint to brimmer that he is onto him, without directly accusing him, so he rather cruelly (but understandable in the circumstances) decides to play mindgames on brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid. which of course he does! all the while, the grieving kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation. it's only near the end that columbo explains all to kennicut (not shown on screen).<br /><br />i won't reveal how columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights, but let's just say there's a potato involved... <br /><br />a really really good episode, possibly the very best of the first series. if you liked this then you'll like "double exposure" too, also featuring robert culp.
