i did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a welles box set i had recently purchased. a box set i chiefly got because i wanted to own a man for all seasons and to also re-evaluate waterloo. so i stick orson and rita in the player and i'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure.<br /><br />on the surface the story seemed a simple one, man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs, they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband, and then.............<br /><br />..well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans. michael o'hara (orson welles} himself doesn't really know what is going on, he is as confused as the viewer is, and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film. obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as elsa bannister (rita hayworth} has its moments, but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped.<br /><br />so many wonderful things in the film, it has welles visual style all over it, see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye. the narration from o'hara is joyously self mocking, and we get good light relief by way of a court case with everett sloane considerably lighting up proceedings.<br /><br />yet the film is an oddity, and in fact it's a choppy viewing experience, because {as i was to find out after} studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour, and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer, but unfair on welles' vision. i'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale, as it is tho, we have a very good and intriguing film, one that sadly only hints at greatness, but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that i'm glad i own to revisit further. 8.5/10
