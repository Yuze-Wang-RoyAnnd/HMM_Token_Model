it tries to be the epic adventure of the century. and with a cast like sh^o kasugi, christopher lee and john-rhys davies it really is the perfect b-adventure of all time. it's actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had. big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. this on the other hand, just has the real feeling. you just can't hate it. i think it's an okay adventure movie. and i really love the soundtrack. damn, i want the theme song.
