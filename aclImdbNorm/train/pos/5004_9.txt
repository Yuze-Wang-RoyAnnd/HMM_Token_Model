but just as entertaining and random! love it or hate it, but don't expect a sophisticated plot or nail-biting cliffhanger. think of it like seinfeld, but without the follow-through and repeat performances of wacky characters (well...so far; i have a feeling i will develop favourites as the season continues).<br /><br />"creature comforts" is not for the faint of humour - it's meant to be enjoyed with the least amount of effort on your brain's part. which is why this show embodies everything i need in a program when i get home from work in the evening: superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of "cute" to the characters for me to enjoy when i eventually look up from the computer to see what i'm missing.<br /><br />funnier than most of today's sitcoms, calmer than an evening at nascar. just the right mix of dead air and comebacks. can't wait for the next one.
