i'm a fan of c&c, going back to their records, and liked this movie, but at one point in the mid-1980's on cable television in san jose california, it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie. all references to marijuana were replaced with "diamonds". the bag that "red" drops to chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana, but the conversation still remains the same ("...it's worth ~$3000/lb"). there is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing c&c, and talking to each other about getting the diamonds. at the end, instead of "space coke", it's something else. i'm not sure who created this version, but it was horrible, and obvious that they were attempting to make it family/child friendly. it would have been better if that network had not aired it at all.
