the combination of reading the novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and i to new levels. recently i was pondering a statement made by the artist thomas kinkade in one of his inspirational books; he states: "you and i were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic. nor do i think god had banal television programs, media hype, worthless purchases, and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe..." i hadn't seen "a river runs through it" in a couple of years, but after pondering kinkade's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye. i watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book (a must read). i have always been frustrated in southern california but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society. the film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience god's creations. a combination of macleans story and my desire to move back to the northwest has driven me to move to montana. i want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape, go fly-fishing with me, ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside. a place where you seldom worry about crime. i look around socal and all i see is shopping malls, rude snarling people in their mercedez bens, miles of vehicles on congested freeways, gangs, racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption, and everyone skeptical of each others intentions.<br /><br />anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones. there is a lot of deep thinking in this film. the scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension. you should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life. it takes a compassionate, intelligent, and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning. if you don't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue, tone, light, colour, scenery, camera angles/movement, etc. then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks "the fast and the furious" is the greatest film. granted it was entertaining but shallow.<br /><br />the bottom line: this film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses. rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together. quality not qauntity
