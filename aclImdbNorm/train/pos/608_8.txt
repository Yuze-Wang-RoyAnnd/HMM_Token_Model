going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. especially a romantic fantasy.<br /><br />little did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic. everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfection.<br /><br />claire danes shines like the star she is in this movie. from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character.<br /><br />michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty.<br /><br />robert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax.<br /><br />overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan. if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike, stardust is the way to go.
