wow! this is a good movie! the acting wasn't good at all, but if you look at some moments in the film, rewind, and watch it again, it is genius! the man in the begin of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. wow!i never expected that. then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. i bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later. and the genius quotes: ''nice shades, i need a pair'' ''their yours.. if you think you can take them..''.. just brilliant! and the fighting is the best i've seen in a while. look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table. what a hit! and in the middle of the film, one guy in a car shot one time, then 3 guys fall, he is really good at aiming. it costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. the end was brilliant, it was so exciting that james cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves. jason peters falls down, and roll over again while he is dead! i can't say with more words how great this movie is!
