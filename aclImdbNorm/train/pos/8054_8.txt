"enter the fat dragon" is one of the funniest martial art movies i had the opportunity to see. sammo hung portrays a chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. just like tang lung of "way of the dragon." wherever sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. luckily, sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, bruce lee. he even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way bruce lee does and also releases his screeching yell. he also uses nunchucks in a scene. it was like watching a fat bruce lee. there's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. sort of like "the game of death", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.<br /><br />this is one of the films i really enjoyed watching and also the very first sammo hung movies i've seen. excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs. a rare classic sammo hung film i highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 8.5/10!
