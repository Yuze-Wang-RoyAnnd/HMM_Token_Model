i first saw this movie 3 years ago, and it was introduced by then disney chief eisner and the real jim morris.<br /><br />about a month ago, it came back on tv, and this time i taped it. since then i must've watched it at least three times.<br /><br />this is a wonderful, inspirational, feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned. it resists going for every sentimental trick in the book, as well as all of the other clich'es.<br /><br />it is refreshing to see a movie where the kids aren't jerks and have a whole slew of behavioral issues, and the jocks aren't portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads.<br /><br />these are just normal people who have dreams like you and i.<br /><br />in my opinion, hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term "gritty realism", making movies where everyone curses, and has problems with aggression.<br /><br />this movie is about a man who has a dream, and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream. the people in big lake tx seem so personable that i want to move there.<br /><br />as i said b4, the film doesn't try to go overboard with sentimentality. dennis quaid, as usual, never disappoints. i've watched him from the late 70's, and he is so underrated.<br /><br />but this movie has excellent performances from everyone concerned, and kudos to the writers.<br /><br />a gem in the movie is near the end when jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game, and his wife calls out to him from the stands. he rushes over and reaches out to his family. the look on the faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the dugout is priceless.<br /><br />if you're looking for a change of pace, then pick this movie up.
