with all the "adult" innuendos in todays family movies its nice to see one where you don't have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids. yes, this movie might have a few swear-words (there's that time where knox swears, but they don't let you hear the full words), but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come (and that's including movies from back in the day). not only that, its very enjoyable, one of my favorites, and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family.<br /><br />the only thing i have against this movie is that it is too short and i wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it, i'm not going to mention them because i don't want any spoilers here.<br /><br />all in all nicely done and a great movie to watch; so go out and get the kids, make some cookies, and watch this movie!
