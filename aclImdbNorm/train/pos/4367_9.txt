i haven't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty. i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of braveheart. it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters. ridb roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like, messy hair and beard with simple clothing. also the liam nesson has a celtic look about him, he looks like a scot and more importantly looks like rob roy. it's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace. gibson is supposedly playing a man who's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter. the story contains a little romance, conspiracy and an underdog story. sound anything like braveheart? but instead of a film that cries out "freedom", liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour, love and justice. this makes it a more interesting film. much like gladiator. the cast is fantastic and liam nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour. the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity. the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic. this is something a heroine in braveheart would never do. overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch. go and see it!
