this would have to be one of the funniest tv sitcoms to come out of the states since the demise of "everybody loves raymond". warburton is always hilarious, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. david spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines. after having raved over the british series, "coupling" i can see from just where the creators of "rules of engagement" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a "brickbat" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. but it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. having been a part of a professional tv comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in australia, i can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. one of the few grievances i have with the series is the very obviously "canned" laughter. surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series.
