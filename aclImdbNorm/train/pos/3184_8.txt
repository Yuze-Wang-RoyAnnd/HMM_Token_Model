this hong kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than week's worth of 'the young & the restless'. this one is more of a throwback to the original 'emmanuelle' trilogy(especially 'goodbye emmanuelle') than a d'amato sleazefest. chai lee(emy wong)undergoes a stunning transformation from dour nurse to hot-to-trot streetwalker. future italian porn star/politician, illona staller, who would later go by the name ciccolina(and have sex with an hiv positive john holmes) plays emy's competition. exotic locales and some decent soft-core scenes round this one out. recommended for fans of the original 'emmanuelle', of which i am one!
