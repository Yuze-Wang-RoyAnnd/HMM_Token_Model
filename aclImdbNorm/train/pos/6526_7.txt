i always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime-time every year in the 60's. it's a typical hollywood history epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what, it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film. cecil b. demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. his son-in-law actor anthony quinn who had the supporting role of beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again. demille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 commandments to help quinn pull it off including longtime demille associate producer/actor henry wilcoxon overseeing the project. also from the 10 commandments are screenwriter jesse lasky, cinematographer loyalk griggs, assistant director francisco day, 2nd unit director arthur rosson, art directors walter tyler and hal pereira, set directors sam comer and ray moyer, costume designers edith head, john jensen and ralph lester who as a costume design team received the buccaneer's only oscar nomination. a great cast here from team demille headed up by yul brynner as pirate jean lafitte and charleton heston as future president general andrew jackson. also in the cast are charles boyer, e.g. marshall, lorne greene, claire bloom and inger stevens. at just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes. i would give it a 7.5 out of 10.
