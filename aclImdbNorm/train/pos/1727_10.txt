the wooden horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by british pow's during world war ii. it is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues leo genn. anthony steele and david tomlinson (later george banks in mary poppins) are marvelous as the two heroes. the direction is taut and fast-moving throughout. highly recommended.
