the show is really funny. nice theme. jokes and one liners are really good. with little extra tuning it can become a very popular show. but the only major negative point of this show is the cast. david spade does a great job as russell, megyn price does a good job. but who the hell did cast patrick warburton, oliver hudson and bianca kajlich.<br /><br />technically russell and jeff are the main characters of the show, which make viewers wanna watch the show. russell is a playboy and jeff is a kind of frustrated family man, the relationship wiz... with an experience of all the problems a married couple face in a relationship.<br /><br />patrick warburton - does a horrible job as jeff, he is not at all suited for the role. he is like a robot, literally there is no punch in his dialog delivery. <br /><br />cast is really very important for viewers to like it. the bad acting certainly will take the show downhill...
