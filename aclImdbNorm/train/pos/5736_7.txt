dumland focuses on the lives of one (american?) family... the father; a violent and obscene person who loves to fart and use profanity and who has no redeeming qualities. the mother; who appears to be a paranoid psychotic, never really says much. the son; an obscure annoying repetitive little fellow. the animation is simple and crude, but does suite the stories and the characters. the episodes were originally only available from the davidlynch.com website, but have now been released on dvd. there are 8 episodes on the dvd and a brief synopsis follows:<br /><br />1- the neighbor: we meet the next door neighbor, and find out three things about him... he has a really nice shed, he only has one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks.<br /><br />2- the treadmill: we find out that the wife has an affinity for exercise, but the husband doesn't really think it's a good idea. in the end, the exercise treadmill is victorious.<br /><br />3- the doctor: the father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire... the doctor's examination is quite thorough (if not unconventional) but the diagnosis is "you are perfectly normal" (but we knew that).<br /><br />4- a friend visits: after an altercation with the new clothes hoist, a friend comes to visit (believe it or not, he has one! but after we meet him we can understand why), no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are.<br /><br />5- get the stick: we meet another neighbor, he has a stick stuck in his mouth (although we never find out how it got there). unfortunately, removing the stick from his neighbor's mouth ends up being harder (and more violent) than expected... but he is victorious in the end... jesus some people can be ungrateful!!!<br /><br />6- my teeth are bleeding: this was my favorite episode... and was also the most mind- numbingly repetitive and annoying (hmm, what does that say about me??). not sure why the son's teeth started bleeding, but believe me when i say it was minimal to the plot of the story. which is an oxymoron, as the story had no plot. but did have a funny ending (involving a fly)!!<br /><br />7- uncle bob: after meeting uncle bob, and uncle bob's wife, we get a distinct feeling that the dumbland gene-pool is very shallow. uncle bob is a sickly fellow (i shan't elaborate, lest i spoil it for you). uncle bob's wife definitely wears the pants in his family... and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her ample fist (and spends the rest of their visit cowering in a tree in the back yard).<br /><br />8- ants: after the home gets infiltrated with ants, and a misbegotten attempt to bug-spray them goes awry... he ends up spraying himself in the face with the bug-spray and starts hallucinating. the ants put on a fabulous song and dance show... he goes berserk trying to kill them, winds up in a full body plaster... and lets just say, the ants get their vengeance in the end.<br /><br />as bad as these stories are, there is something that kept compelling me to watch them. they do give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors. david lynch. maybe they were an outlet for him, to get rid of some of his violent thoughts?? i did actually laugh out loud at many points within the episodes. many aspects are absurdly funny!!
