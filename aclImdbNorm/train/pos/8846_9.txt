i really enjoyed this drama from sidney lumet. the best word i could come up to describe it with is insane. it throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end. trust me, this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through.<br /><br />the story is very well crafted and almost brilliant. it's almost like a more complicated tarantino type story. the acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts, excellent cast. i also loved the cinematography, it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film. it was all great.<br /><br />this movie is excited, exhausting and heartbreaking. it's almost hard to watch but you'll be glad that you did.
