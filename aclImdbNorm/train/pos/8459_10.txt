i'm not a big fan of most anime, but gundam wing is truly something else. gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime, since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double digits, gundam wing gets right down to business. <br /><br />gundam wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series. large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war, not only the battles. though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate, individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. <br /><br />to my knowledge, this 49 episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in 2000, and then professionally dubbed by them too. the dubbing is simply flawless. not only does every word said match up, but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable. many believe that it is best to watch anime with subs in english, but i simply don't have the determination to do that. <br /><br />not only are the voices good, but the score used over the series is quite impressive. i'll just say it left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack. <br /><br />the plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers, and no, not hook you like some prime time drama like lost which was only made for the purpose of hooking you. explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers, since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series. the rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace. thus a war is started, leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations. i feel that any more detail would begin to give away information, which is crucial to the plot. <br /><br />i'll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime, anyone that thinks all anime is stupid (they have good reason to think so), and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it.
