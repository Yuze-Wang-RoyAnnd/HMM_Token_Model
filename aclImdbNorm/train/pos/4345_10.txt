it is no wonder this movie won 4 prices, it is a movie that lingers to any soul, it isn't a wonder why it took paul reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to peter falk about his idea. i can understand every part of it, this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear, or thousands.<br /><br />story: 10/10 when sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her, and while they do that they find something lost, friendship, family, and affection for each other. at the beginning you know whats going to happen, but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end, it is a ride between a father and his son, and a husband and his wife. it is no wonder it took paul reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance/comedy.<br /><br />actors: 10/10 well you cant say anything else that what i about to say, hey it is with peter falk in it, he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic, when you use peter falk in a romance/comedy what do you think you get? a perfect outcome, it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices. as the son paul reiser does an excellent job, although he isn't a great actor always that doesn't mean that this didn't work actually peter falk and paul reiser plays the perfect father and son, the rest of the cast is good enough but you don't see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more. <br /><br />music: 10/10 it doesn't always work when using music sometimes it just doesn't fit but that is not the thing in this movie, the music is perfect in tune, it makes the movie even more compelling. this part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts, a great soundtrack for a romance/comedy thats for sure.<br /><br />overall: 10/10 there are so many romance/comedy movies out on tapes, dvds, blu-ray and what not, but this movie is one of the special ones. it doesn't happen everyday that you can create a story like this, it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it, a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul, see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age, i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made.
