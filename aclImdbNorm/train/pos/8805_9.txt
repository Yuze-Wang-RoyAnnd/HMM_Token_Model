a patchwork about 911. the 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic, sometimes boring (the first one, for example), sometimes used to say to americans "we have had more deaths than you, and you supported the murderers", sometimes really weird (but highly symbolic and interesting). i really loved the claude lelouch (personal live of a couple in new-york, showing that our day-to-day "problems" are unimportant), shoei imamura (bizarre, strongly anti-wars in general), and idrissa ouedraogo (funny, typical african optimism despite terrible day to day misery), and youssef chahine (an egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, having moral difficulties to accept the u.s. policy towards arab countries) i am really pleased to see that many americans liked this movie. it shows that we (or they ? i am still belgian, but living in texas for 12 years) are still interested by other cultures, and able to question past and present actions of our government, like we should in a democracy.
