i thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it. the actors were on top of their character's backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great. the music was lush and well-thought-out. it even had a decent twist of an ending. so what's with everyone voting it down? the story wasn't entirely fresh (felt like a remnant of "running man" with the whole television show idea), but the attitude towards christianity and judaism about how the public picks their messiah certainly sounded true enough. it made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity.<br /><br />it's possible that christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word "god" in it, but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this, especially in the modern world where christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some.<br /><br />i gave it a 7/10 stars here on imdb. i thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original, for the most-part. check it out if you're not too offended to see an entertaining film from madrid, spain, about possibilities of the coming modern messiah to a tv near you.
