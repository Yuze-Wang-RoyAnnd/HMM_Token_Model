the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast, and excellent direction by james eves. the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast. james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action, fall and then rise to a climax. he does this with an element of humour, plenty of twists, thrills and blood. this is a return of the old vampire movie, with loads of gore, blood and screams. the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure,but what makes it work is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek action.great !
