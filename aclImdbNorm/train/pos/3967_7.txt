this isn't among jimmy stewart's best films--i'm quick to admit that. however, while some view his film as pure propaganda, i'm wondering what's so wrong with that? yes, sure, like the tv show the fbi, this is an obvious case of the bureau doing some pr work to try to drum up support. but, as entertainment goes, it does a good job. plus, surprisingly enough for the time it was made, the film focuses more on crime than espionage and "commies". instead, it's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose. now considering the agent is played by jimmy stewart, then it's pretty certain the acting and writing were good--as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasn't about to waste the star in a third-rate flick. so overall, it's worth seeing but not especially great.
