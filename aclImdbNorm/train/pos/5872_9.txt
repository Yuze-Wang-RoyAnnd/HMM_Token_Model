who votes in these ratings? "jacknife" is a beautifully acted, brilliantly observed piece of work, with actors on top of their game, especially ed harris and the peerless robert deniro(please don't mention marlon brando in the same breath of this man-see "taxi driver" for confirmation of this point). is it a 'mundane' movie because it doesn't have sex/meaningless action/nudity in it. this movie is about the complexities of the characters involved. ed harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional outburst towards the end is heartbreaking. the part where he orders a young man in a bar to take off his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and the movies exploit tragic situations and how frustrated real men must feel to see a young upstart sporting military attire. while we are on this subject, "casino" 7.8 out of 10? one of the greatest films of all time, from one of the greatest directors, starring the greatest movie actor of all time, with the scariest film psychotic gangster ever, only warrants just above average? come on!!!!!
