lars von trier's europa is a worthy echo of the third man, about an american coming to post-world war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery.<br /><br />jean-marc barr plays leopold kessler, a german-american who refused to join the us army during the war, arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway. what he doesn't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies. leopold is strongly against taking any sides, but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann (barbara sukowa), the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company. her father was a nazi sympathizer, but is pardoned by the american colonel harris (eddie considine) because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again. the colonel soon enlists, or forces, leopold to be a spy (without giving him a choice or chance to think about it) to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains.<br /><br />soon, leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir-ish way, where everyone and everything is not what it seems. its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, annoying passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even the railway company's officials who come to examine his work ethic) before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control. the film is endlessly unpredictable.<br /><br />the film stylishly shot, it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow. its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout. also, background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front. add max von sydow's hypnotic narration, and europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world.<br /><br />this is now a personal favorite film of mine.
