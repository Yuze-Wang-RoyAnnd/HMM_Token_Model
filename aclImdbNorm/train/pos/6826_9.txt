john cassavetes' "opening night" is fantastic and fascinating; fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination, fascinating because it never ceases surprising us. with its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, anyone who appreciates characters won't be able to take their eyes off the screen.<br /><br />the story of an unstable actress, myrtle gordon, (gena rowlands) trying to put herself together for a play, fighting her demons; "opening night" is not only about a woman on the verge of a breakdown but also about the complexities of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world. all of cassavetes' characters here are experienced people that know about the world of theater; so half of the film takes place on a stage, either where the performers do their job or at backstage, where producers and writers and directors do their job.<br /><br />cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this unkindness turns towards the audience, but the audience in the cinema. because there is another audience, in the theater of the film, that doesn't know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance. and that's essentially what it is; it's just that the audience in the theater doesn't get to see 'backstage' the way we do. they don't experience gena rowlands' exuberance before she goes out to that stage, but most importantly; they don't know the reasons why she acts the way she does.<br /><br />i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor. myrtle (rowland) says she's an actress and that's the only thing she knows how to do; and i imagine that if i had a friend who was a professional performer, it would be really difficult to tell when he's saying the truth because i would know he's an actor and he can fake anything at any time. a lot of the things that myrtle does during the awful experiences the film puts her through
