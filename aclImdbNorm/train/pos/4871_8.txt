it takes a serbian or at least a balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'zavet' as well as of many other films of kusturica. see for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the soviet hymn. kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process.<br /><br />this is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case. it's a fun film before all. kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies. his style is direct and grotesque, we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same. the space he develops melds present, history and magic, and the colours seem to be of a douanier rousseau of modern cinema.<br /><br />this is not a perfect film either. the principal flaw is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful, as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up. it is yet one of the most catching, amusing, moving films that i have seen lately.
