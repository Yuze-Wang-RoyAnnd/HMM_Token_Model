i have been a jodie foster fan ever since we were both kids, from her disney years. i loved her tomboy antics in films like candleshoe.<br /><br />"foxes" was such a huge departure from all of that.<br /><br />where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy ("little darlings", anyone?), jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addiction.<br /><br />this was not disney. this was not porky's. this was not "halloweed". this was a dark & powerful story of the destruction of young lives. sadly it's a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country, this film could be replayed (with a current soundtrack) and still be wholly relevant.<br /><br />it's not the best film ever made, it is tired at some parts, not all the performances are particularly outstanding. but jodie foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actor (a trend started when she was very young in taxi driver).<br /><br />7 out of 10 barky
