those french and those germans sure have a long history of not liking each other. it is interesting to note that kamerdaschaft or comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. only a few years later, hitler would siege germany and begin his plans to take over the world, france being a casualty of his ambitions. but these are times of sereneness compared to the future. a group of miners at the border try to cross over to france to get work. they are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their french neighbors. then a disaster happens in the mines of the french and a well-crafted and written scene, a troupe of german miners decide to come to the rescue. a simple story is it not? pabst was a poet of silent cinema and i am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. he isn't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal. ther is even a flashback to a wwii event that beckons the point of this story. supposedly based on a real event, the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness. smetimes, that's what a movie needs to be.
