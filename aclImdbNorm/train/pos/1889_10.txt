my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out. we have most lines memorized. i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that dudley moore portrays. liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though i'm not her biggest fan. this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his fianc'ee's house. his conversation with the butler and susan's father is side-spitting. the line from the butler, "would you care to wait in the library" followed by arthur's reply, "yes i would, the bathroom is out of the question", is my newmail notification on my computer. "arthur is truly "funny stuff"!
