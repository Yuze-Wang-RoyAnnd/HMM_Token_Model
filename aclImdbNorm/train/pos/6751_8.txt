pretty good film from preminger; labyrinthine at times, as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live. in this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying, as its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head.<br /><br />dana andrews plays the lead as if it were hamlet, and has never been better. the story may be pure melodrama but andrews gives it weight, and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. as his girl, gene tierney is attractive but unremarkable. gary merrill makes for a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to andrews' coolness; his smiling, amiable-seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open, as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him. <br /><br />there are no major surprises in this film, which seems transitional for all concerned. for director preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his laura stars, andrews and tierney, who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made. the supporting cast,--merrill, karl malden, neville brand--are, understandably, more optimistic, as they were all on their way up. preminger, as serene an observer as ever, lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view, as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain, much less resolve.<br /><br />
