and laugh out loud funny in many scenes.<br /><br />the movie's basic plot is well chronicled, a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity.<br /><br />this is unquestionably lemmon and matheau's best film as co-stars, and the interaction between the sloppy oscar and the ocd felix are classic.<br /><br />the scene where oscar lines up a double date, leaves the room briefly, and comes back to find felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funny.<br /><br />for any fan of intelligent comedies, the odd couple is a "go out of your way to see it" film.
