"ko to tamo peva" is one of the best films i ever saw. a tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a god-forsaken serbian province just before the start of the world war ii. i saw it in a small movie theater in russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and i had no chance to come across it ever since. it is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now. i searched for a vhs or dvd copy of it many times, and alas - could find none. i would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy.
