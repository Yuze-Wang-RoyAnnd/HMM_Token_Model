look, if i were interested in a nancy drew book, what i would do is pick up a book and read it. i'm not. ever since i can remember i read people trashing movies because it wasn't like the book. i'm sorry - in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books, however i'm sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form. when lord of the rings came out, people complained. when the third one won an oscar - "the book was better." when i watched to kill a mockingbird, "the book was better." now a bunch of people are upset, yet again, because nancy drew wasn't like the book. i'm not saying nancy drew is going to win any oscars - if anything it'll be one of those nickelodeon blimps or kids choice awards. i'm saying give film a break. it's film, not paper. as a movie, i found nancy drew quite enjoyable - featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg (the hebrew hammer) and supporting roles featuring tate donovan (jimmy cooper on the o.c.) and rachel leigh cook (she's all that). this is the first time i've seen emma roberts in a movie and, frankly, i enjoy her work more than most of julia and of eric's; her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict. a lighthearted movie in the spirit of harriet the spy is nice now and again.<br /><br />i give it ten stars because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie, would love to see it again, and will probably buy it upon dvd release.
