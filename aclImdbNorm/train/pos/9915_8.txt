i had nowhere to go. i was on a flight to vancouver. i would probably have missed this film if i hadn't chosen air canada. watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front, i found this captivating and mesmerising. i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to it's end. now i'm looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether i'll be quite as transfixed when i can walk out the door, is yet to be discovered!<br /><br />the photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills out' the story the photographs tell.<br /><br />recommended (if you have time on your hands).
