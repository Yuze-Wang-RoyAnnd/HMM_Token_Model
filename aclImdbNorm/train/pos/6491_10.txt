world at war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time. the historical research is virtually flawless. even after a quarter century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about ww2. an invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war. i highly recommend it as a learning experience.
