for my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. after some research on the internet, i found this dvd and ordered it. i just finished watching it and i am still thinking about it. all i can say is "wow". it is such a compelling story of a 12 year old vietnamese girl named holly and an american man named patric who tries to save her. the ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic. it is amazing and i recommend it to anyone! you really connect with holly and patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her. i loved it so much and now i want to know what happens next!
