if the man in the white suit had been done in america, can't you see either danny kaye or jerry lewis trying on alec guinness's sidney stratton on for size?<br /><br />this is one of the best of alec guinness's films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out. it's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new labour government and the society it was trying to build. it's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree.<br /><br />alec guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment. <br /><br />he's a persistent cuss and he does succeed. of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society. in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive, almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert newton in oliver twist. <br /><br />it's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films i've mentioned can be played for laughs. poor guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign.<br /><br />other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous oaf, joan greenwood as his siren daughter and ernest thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the uk> <br /><br />come to think of it, did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever?
