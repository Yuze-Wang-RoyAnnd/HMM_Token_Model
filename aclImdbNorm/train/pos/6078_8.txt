i was especially delighted that in this movie othello himself was dark-skinned and desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. the cast played very well, too, and i liked the script following shakespeare's original text so faithfully. but i must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as desdemona. i have always thought she is very modest, and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with cassio - although it was happening only in othello's imagination. at first, i was a little surprised even that a love scene between othello and desdemona was shown so openly. but as a whole, i liked the film and especially desdemona crying in the dying scene.
