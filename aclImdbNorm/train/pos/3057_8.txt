wow i really liked this movie, william h. macy is great as the quiet hit-man alex.<br /><br />all the performances here are really good, the plot is interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />alex, a married hit-man (like his father)with a little son, is going through a middle age crisis and wants to quit the family business so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place he meets the young free will spirit sarah of whom he falls in love to. one day alex doesn't know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows. <br /><br />i recommend you to watch it if you like mature interesting movies.<br /><br />8 stars = very good
