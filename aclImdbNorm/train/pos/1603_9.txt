i'm really suprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb. it's one of those movies that could easily get by someone, but for romantic comedy "moonstruck" is really in a class by itself. it's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted. the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie. few movies in the 1980's were as good as "moonstruck"and it's funny too. **** out of *****
