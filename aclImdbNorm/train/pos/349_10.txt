call me stupid, but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie, valentine. it was so well-made, well-written, well-acted, well-directed, etc! everything about it was wonderful! there were parts that were relatively routine (lily's death), very funny (www.bleed-me-dry.com), completely horrifying and creepy (paige's death), and just plain heartbreaking (the first scene). i think the entire cast did a great job, especially the three leads: david boreanaz, denise richards (both of whom i met, and got autographs from, during the filming of this movie - very nice people!), and marley shelton.<br /><br />i am very sick of people calling this movie "another scream clone". this movie is, in no way, a scream clone. in fact, this film runs rings around scream. it actually makes sense! scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it. excuse me, but it looks like scream was also a clone too (ahem..., friday the 13th, halloween, and many other scary movies also featured masked killers). i also think that the novelty of the cupid-masked killer is brilliant. it's so strange to see a sweet, cupid face doing all of these horrible things. another novelty (the nose bleeding) makes way for a fantastic ending! the ending gives me chills every time i see it!!!!! so, even if you didn't like it the first time, watch valentine again and give it another chance!<br /><br />ps- keep an eye out for my new website (www.love-hurts.org)! coming soon...
