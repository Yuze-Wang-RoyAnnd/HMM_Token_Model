*possible spoilers* although done before (and better) in 'midnight express' and 'return to paradise', brokedown palace still strikes a chord with me.<br /><br />here we have the tale of two young girls who travel through thailand, and get arrested on charges of trafficking drugs. was it clare danes' alice? was it kate beckinsale's darlene? was it the handsome stranger whom they met on their journey? none of that really matters, for this is a tale of friendship and trust and the limits they can be stretched to. throw in bill pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and jacqueline kim as his thai bride (and better lawyer than he is) and we have a nice little story that holds the audience's attention.<br /><br />brokedown palace is nothing extraordinary, or notorious for any reason - it is not an original concept, it doesn't show sensationalised violence that leads to the wannabe-avant-garde crowd talking about it's "gritty realism" or "hard hitting truths" - it is merely a good story with some fine performances. bill pullman is weakest with his lazy drawl and gravelly way of talking - i was quite bored with the character.<br /><br />kate beckinsale, while decent, is nothing spectacular. she acts well, but it's not exactly a memorable performance.<br /><br />jacqueline kim however, is in fine form, crafting a likable and defined character where, really, there is not much to work with.<br /><br />but make no mistake - this is clare danes' movie. i've long been a fan of her work, and this is no change. she captivates in every scene she appears, and were it not for her, the film would probably stoop into boring fare. i particularly applaud her performance in the scene between her and darlene's father.<br /><br />the film also has a brilliant soundtrack.<br /><br />7 out of 10
