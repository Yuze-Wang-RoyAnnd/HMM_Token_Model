there's no way to confront 'zabriskie point' from a rational standpoint or attempt to describe it using words and conventions you'd use for other movies. this is because it isn't a movie. it's an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film. what we see are not the unfoldings of a plot, but rather a sequence of events that we don't see in films every day but only imagine happening as the background we ourselves will supply when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friends. we we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us- no one we know, but we've doubtless heard of them in a book or on tv or somewhere. so what do we see? events. we see people arguing, driving, and inevitably, escaping. only the escape is from something intangible- it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist though laziness, or...human nature. set in late 1960s los angeles, our players act against and in response to the self-inflicted miseries of modern existence. these creatures are effectively blank slates that can display any trait we can imagine if we desire. although the actions taken might be seen as criminal or irresponsible, , the characters are not themselves criminals. they are human beings seeking a return to a familiar, non-manufactured existence that is beyond the normalcy they experience everyday. not that they are ever happy or sad, but they achieve a type of self actualization when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living. they only achieve true life in the natural world, even though that is the next victim of modern existence. at the end, 'zabriski point' is a eulogy of humanities attachment to the natural world. as even the most desolate pieces of the earth succumb to our notions of progress, we lose our souls on the path to death of the human spirit.
