this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is a one man industry. this movie will also tell you why indian movie-goers are astute buyers.<br /><br />amitabh was at the peak of his domination of bollywood when his one-time godfather prakash mehra decided to use his image yet again. prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it, adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clich'es to it. zanzeer saw the making of angry young man. lawaris was about being a bastard and namak halal was about the master-servant loyalties. <br /><br />but then, the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song, dance and drama. what comprised of the movie is a caricature of a haryanavi who goes to mumbai and turns into a regulation hero. amitabh's vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks, thanks to his flawless stock haryanvi accent. to me, this alone is the biggest pull in the movie. the rest all is typical bollywood screen writing.<br /><br />amitabh, by now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies. thanks to manmohan desai. this movie had a good dose of them. the shoe caper in the party, the monologue over vijay merchant and vijay hazare's considerations, the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard amitabh fare.<br /><br />shashi kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody, finicky character (remember him asking ranjeet to "shaaadaaaap" after the poisoned cake incident"). his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant. but prakash mehra knew the indian mind...and so shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie. it was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie. but this is a caper, remember? and as long as it stayed that way, the people came and saw amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy. the end is always predictable, and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol, the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well.<br /><br />so what is it that makes this movie a near classic? amitabh bacchan as the haryanvi. prakash mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story. chuck the story, the characters and the plot. my marks are for amitabh alone.
