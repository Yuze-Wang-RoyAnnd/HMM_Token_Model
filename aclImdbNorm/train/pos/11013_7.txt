there were a lot of films made by hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public. seen today, some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda--which they technically are, but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation. this film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre--having a pretty realistic script and good production values. pat o'brien plays pretty much the same character he played in many other films (you know, the tough-talking, hard-driven but "swell guy"). randolph scott is, as always, competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young robert ryan as one of the bombardiers in training). while the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews, the film is well-crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. that it, perhaps, except for the very end--where the film is a bit over-the-top but also very satisfying. about the only serious negative, and this is mostly for nitpickers, is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and "nuts" like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this--all others probably won't notice.
