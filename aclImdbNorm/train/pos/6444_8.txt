the line, of course, is from the lord's prayer - "thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven". sweden, especially its far north, is not my idea of heaven -30 degree c winter temperatures are a little on the low side for me, but the good folk who live there no doubt think they are in god's own country.<br /><br />the storyline here is a familiar one. acclaimed international musician daniel suffers health breakdown in mid-career, goes back to the little village in northern sweden where he was born. persuaded by the local pastor to help out with the church choir, he turns some unlikely talent into a class act, and they enter a contest held in innsbruck austria. there are echoes (sorry) of the band players of "brassed off" the models of "calendar girls" and the dancers of "the full monty". but of course he causes plenty of emotional upheaval as some of the more downtrodden villagers realise their worth and revolt against their oppressors. he faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor, but nothing except death is going to stop him.<br /><br />despite the somewhat corny story, we get to know and like many of the characters, who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being recognisable "types'. i did wonder about the wife-beater being unpunished for so long
