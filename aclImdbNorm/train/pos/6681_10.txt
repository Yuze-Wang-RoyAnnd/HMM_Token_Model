this movie deserved better it's great fun, has some wonderful jokes and sight gags, some in-stuff for the "geeks" amongst us (and we know who we are), and the effects are indeed effectual. watching paul reubens fart in the face of an academy award winner is worth the price of admission alone. i never read the comics series before i saw the movie, but have since. as good as they are, i still recommend mm the film. (although having the flaming carrot as a character would have been cool, too) greg kinnear is, well,...amazing as captain amazing, and no one else could be the shoveller except william h. macy my favorite line in the film? "we've got a blind date with destiny. and it looks like she's ordered the lobster." see this film. buy this film! it's only 5 bucks and some change at your local wal-mart. you'll thank me. really you will. oh, and ms. garafolo is in it. that alone makes it watch-worthy
