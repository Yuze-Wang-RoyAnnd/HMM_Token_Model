i was really stunned how much a film, that's over 60 years old could impress me. it is nearly two hours long, there are absolutely no stars in it, there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch. what impressed me mostly was the realism of the film. you could nearly feel the coldness of the ice, because you could see that the storms are real. this is a relief in a cgi-world like ourdays. i wondered how much work this must have been for van dyke. i read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. now who wants to talk about 'titanic' anymore? it's a great film with a great message and i would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects.
