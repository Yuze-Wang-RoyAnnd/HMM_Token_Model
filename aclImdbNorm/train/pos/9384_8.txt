an excellent example of "cowboy noir", as it's been called, in which unemployed michael (nicolas cage) loses out on a job because he insists on being honest (he's got a bum leg). with really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he's going to lie. when he walks into a bar, and the owner wayne (the late, great j.t. walsh) mistakes him for a hit-man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle in fine form), michael plays along and accepts waynes' money. *then* he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions, and accepts *her* money to get rid of wayne! if that didn't complicate things enough, the real hit-man, "lyle from dallas" (dennis hopper, in a perfect role for him) shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before.<br /><br />"red rock west" gets a lot out of the locations. director john dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother rick, was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes. it's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation. it's an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt, have at least been morally compromised like michael. the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness; even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing. even if the writing isn't particularly "logical or credible", the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in.<br /><br />cage does a good job in the lead, but his co-stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed-motivated characters. hopper, boyle, and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts. timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs' deputies (in one especially good twist, walsh is also the local sheriff), and there's an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam, who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune.<br /><br />it's quite a good little film worth checking out. it moves forward at an impressive pace, and if nothing else is certainly never boring.<br /><br />8/10
