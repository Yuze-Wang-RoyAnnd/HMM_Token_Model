i consider myself a huge movie buff. i was sick on the couch and popped in this film. right from the opening to the end i watched in awe at these great actors, i'd never seen, say great word. the filming was beautiful. it was just what i needed. i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others. the director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout. thanku for making a film like this one. just wonderfully awkward, beautiful kind characters who are flawed and graceful all at once. just great. i can't submit this without 10 lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director, more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer. i didn't want it to end. the end
