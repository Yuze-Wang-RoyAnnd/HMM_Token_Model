after seeing the "batman dead end" short, i didn't know what to really expect from world's finest. of course, superman and batman. all my world's finest comic books have them as the team-up.<br /><br />after seeing this 3-and-a-half minute trailer, it made me wish someone would make a serialized fan film for world's finest, if not an actual full-length film.<br /><br />sure, some of the superman stuff was cheesy, but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers, giving you only certain aspects of the entire product. this looks like it needs a complete product.<br /><br />other than director sandy collera's relative playing an achingly poor perry white, most of the actors were unknown. if an actual movie was made, actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film, though i believe nina kaczorowski would make a good lois lane, especially if given closer-to-the-character dialogue.<br /><br />good to see clark bartram wearing the batman costume from dead end, but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s batman with the 80s-90s leather cape and cowl. his demeanor is batman-like, but i still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask. i believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona.<br /><br />michael o'hearn cannot play superman, period. he stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says, "slap me." and line delivery seems to be a problem with him.<br /><br />overall, though, i would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work. there was a rumor about a world's finest movie being made, and with the correct additions to the script, this could be it. hope more like this are made.
