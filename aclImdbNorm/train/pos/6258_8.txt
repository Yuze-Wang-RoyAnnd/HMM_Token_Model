they probably could have skipped some of the beginning - i'm not sure why this starts out in the asian part of turkey. if it was because starting in the mediterranean, they could have gotten closer starting in modern day lebanon.<br /><br />one the cameras and crews get to the bakhtyari tribe, it's the beginning of an amazing 48 day journey. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle, and horses make this amazing trek across what seems to be a very fast moving karun river. they use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins - you can see where the head and legs were removed. the other "bank" of the river was very steep - i'm guessing about a 60 degree rise.<br /><br />just watching that was incredible, but there was much more to come. to get to the pastures, they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in and of itself, but they (and all of the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! yes, barefoot.<br /><br />the one drawback to this documentary were some of the inter-titles with poor attempts at humor.<br /><br />if you want to see a documentary from the silent era, or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only face, but conquer. this is just an incredible document of a little known group of people facing all kinds of challenges.
