as peckinpah did with straw dogs, and kubrick with a clockwork orange, director john boorman delivers an effective film about man's violent side in deliverance, arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s. burt reynolds, jon voight, ned beatty, and ronny cox portray four atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild cahulawassee river in northern georgia before it is dammed up into what reynolds calls "one big, dead lake."<br /><br />but the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these "city boys" carousing through their woods. and the following day, continuing on down the river, beatty and voight are accosted and sexually assaulted (the film's infamous "squeal!" sequence) by two vicious mountain men (bill mckinney, herbert "cowboy" coward). thus, what started out as nothing more than a lark through the appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism.<br /><br />james dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book, and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker. often known for its "squeal!" and "dueling banjos" sequences, deliverance is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal, with the four leading men superb in their roles, and mckinney and coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times. a must-see film for those willing to take a chance.
