marjorie (a splendid and riveting performance by farrah fawcett) narrowly avoids being assaulted in her car by vicious serial rapist joe (superbly played with frightening conviction and intensity by james russo). however, joe steals her wallet and finds out where marjorie lives. he pays her a visit one fateful day. after subjecting marjorie to plenty of degradation and psychological abuse, marjorie manages to turn the tables on joe and locks him in the fireplace. what is marjorie going to do with joe? director robert m. young and screenwriter william mastrosimone concoct a harsh, gritty and often disturbing morality tale that astutely nails the stark brutality and painful debasement of rape while also showing how any person when pushed to extremes is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity. joe perceives women strictly as objects while marjorie only sees joe as an "animal." however, this movie to its admirable credit refuses to make joe out to be simply a vile one-dimensional creep; instead he's a terrifyingly real and ultimately pitiable human monster with a wife and kid (joe's climactic confession in particular is genuinely poignant). fawcett and russo are both outstanding in the leads; they receive fine support from diana scarwid as the passive terry, alfre woodard as the sensible patricia, and sandy martin as sympathetic policewoman officer sudow. both curtis clark's agile cinematography and j.a.c. redford's shivery, skin-crawling score greatly enhance the considerable claustrophobic tension. a real powerhouse.
