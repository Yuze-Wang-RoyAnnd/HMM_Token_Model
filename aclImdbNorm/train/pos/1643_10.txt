this is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting. mr. torn and ms farrel do an outstanding job. i think they should have it on tv again so a new audience can enjoy it. wonderful performances.<br /><br />it gives you a real feel of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally. great unheard of movie.<br /><br />it was done when ms. farrel was very young. i had always thought of her as a comedian, but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful. there is very little dialogs, but that just make it seem more real. mr. torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling. i must see movie.
