the lead characters in this movie fall into two categories: smart and stupid. simple enough.<br /><br />jiri machacek (standa) plays a hapless, dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit. when he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil, former boss, the situation gets out of control.<br /><br />while standa is genuinely (but endearingly) stupid, his buddy ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot who bungles everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time. without ondrej, standa might stand a chance of going through life with some modest degree of success. with ondrej, life will never be boring, but it sure won't be without a lot of headaches!<br /><br />ivan trojan plays zdenek, an evil genius type who degenerates into some hitler-esquire delusional tyrant. zdenek and his henchmen try to kill standa to keep zdenek's secrets safe.<br /><br />i am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of czech films. for a relatively small country, the czech republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment. the best czech movies i have seen are: 1) peli
