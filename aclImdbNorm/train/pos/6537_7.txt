the kids i took to this movie loved it (four children, ages 9 to 12 years; they would have given it 10 stars). emma roberts was adorable in the title role. (expect to see more of this next-generation roberts in the future.) after being over exposed to the likes of britney spears, lindsay lohan, and paris hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who didn't look like she worked the streets. also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included tate donovan, rachel leigh cook, barry bostwick, and monica parker (with a cameo by bruce willis). final takeaway: cute film.<br /><br />(note: i did not read the book series, so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone.)
