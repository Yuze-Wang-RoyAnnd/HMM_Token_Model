'midnight cowboy' was rated x with the original release back in 1969. there are some scenes where you can understand that, just a little. the movie about joe buck (jon voight) coming from texas to new york city to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing. dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler, making money by the act of love. it does not work out as he planned. after a guy named rico 'ratso' rizzo (dustin hoffman) first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends. they live in an empty and very filthy apartment. then ratso gets sick and joe has to try to make some money.<br /><br />the movie was probably rated x for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things. the editing in this movie is great. we see dream sequences from joe and ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way. dustin hoffman, jon voight and the supporting actors give great performances. especially hoffman delivers some fine famous lines. the score is done by john barry and sounds great. all this makes this a great movie that won the best picture oscar for a good reason.
