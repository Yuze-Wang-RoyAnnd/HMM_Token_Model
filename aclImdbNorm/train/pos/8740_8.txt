there is great detail in a bug's life. everything is covered. the film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping. the film isn't too terribly orignal, it's basically a modern take on kurosawa's seven samurai, only with bugs. i enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad. it seems that disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs. the grasshoppers are menacing and hopper, the lead bad guy, was a brillant creation. check this one out.
