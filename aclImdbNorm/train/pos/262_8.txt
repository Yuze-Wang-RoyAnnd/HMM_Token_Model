***spoilers*** ***spoilers***<br /><br />this movie, "the divers", is really interesting. all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history, underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish. but i decided to check it out for one reason, the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine. i've got a fetish for german subs, especially wrecks that can be dived upon. so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part, but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part. knowing that nordic films aren't always that good and not sure of the budget size i was, to say the least, very sceptical.<br /><br />upon viewing i was ... surprised.<br /><br />i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate, seeing how some are very young, the two main actors in particular. this was not an issue, they both perform very well. as do the other actors, who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond. this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old, not often seen on the screen. not unique in anyway, but somewhat rare. and it's all good.<br /><br />as for the danish language, it is nearly impossible to understand. but this was no problem, it had subtitles.<br /><br />another issue was the submarine itself, i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine. having decided their budget was slim, i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it's worst. again i was surprised, the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. having a fetish for german subs, i knew what the sub should look like, especially inside, and was not let down. the team has done some serious research. it's all good.<br /><br />i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a "warning". the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war. it's a special purpose sub. but to give you a hint of what to expect, it's a crossing between a type vii, type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i-52. it's god a good design and makes a nice wreck.<br /><br />the setting is on a danish island or peninsula, i can't remember. it's summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year. their grandfather is a mariner of sorts. the cinematography is quite nice, a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks, some newfound teenage love, nice diving weather and a general feeling of "perfect". once again, it's all good.<br /><br />plot-wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind, a gathering of men hire one of the boats, an old minesweeper and it's crew. one of the visitors, a man in his 50's, has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back. the island's senior citizens all remember when a german u-boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths. the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u-boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945. no submarine was ever found.<br /><br />what to expect<br /><br />key elements are nazi experiments, nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy, and ...a surprise.<br /><br />*** warning - spoiler ***<br /><br />i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard. not being a big fan of supernatural events, it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem. it's not like "from dusk til dawn" where everybody turns into vampires towards the end. this is a bit more subtle.<br /><br />overall : really good movie, i gave it an 8. some due to the fact that it isn't a hollywood movie with unlimited resources. i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans. but even if this had been a hollywood production, i would give it a 7 or 8. definately worth your while. yes, a child's story in a way, but then again a mature tale. it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure, which i found very appealing. and, again, the cinematography is really nice.<br /><br />/medusa 2001<br /><br />
