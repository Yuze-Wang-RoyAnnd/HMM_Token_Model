i ran across this movie at the local video store during their yearly sidewalk sale. while scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find a few cartoon movies for sale, i came across this movie. i read the back of the movie and knew it was god's hand at work for me to purchase this movie. you see, i have a sibling group of three foster (and soon to be adopted) children living with my family. immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starring in the movie. the movie helped them better understand their own circumstances. for the first time, also, the oldest of the sibling group (7 year old/female) decided to open up to me a little bit about her past and the trauma she had experienced. she has been fighting the entire trust issue. this is also the first time i had seen her cry. after watching the film, i asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted. she replied, "it means to be happy." a must see for families who are fostering children and are considering adoption. it certainly opened the lines of communication with us.
