those of you who know the group deus, know the lead singer tom barman. he directed this movie a bit like he creates music, it's a mix of everything. this is a comedy, though mostly absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least, and it does not really have a goal.<br /><br />the movie starts on a friday morning in antwerp, belgium, with scenes of several persons, some of them have nothing in common but they will come in contact with each other during the day and night. there are several main characters: a teacher who writes books nobody reads, a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men constantly in touch with the law, a man who works in a movie theater and two young women. throughout the movie there walks a man who has something to do with wind. all characters have their troubles, with their family or friends or just with life itself.<br /><br />the movie is set in antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and the port. the events of the day are not easily explained, i advise to simply watch the movie, there is simply too much to tell. but i can say this, barman has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not really rock) to set a mood, especially the party is filled with excellent music.<br /><br />this movie is an experience on itself, it will not leave you any wiser about life, perhaps only that you have to live it and not waste it, or have any false moral truths.<br /><br />in short, see it, it is definitely worth it!
