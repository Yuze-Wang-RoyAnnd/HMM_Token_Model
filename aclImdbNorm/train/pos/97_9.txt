this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd , since my 33 rpm got lost,and any cassettes i made are also long gone.<br /><br />i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music , which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin ( esp little st. nick ! ) it also contained a few little known songs ( original ? ).<br /><br />even though it was done at the end of the '70's this show had a timeless feel to it. hoping to find a copy soon !!!
