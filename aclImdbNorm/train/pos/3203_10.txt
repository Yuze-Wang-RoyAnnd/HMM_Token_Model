i think that this film was one of kurt russels good movies. kurt russel is my favorite actor so i think that he is a good actor in any role he plays. but this movie had a lot of action in it and i know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie. oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie. if you see this movie and like it i think that you should see back draft also with kurt russel. i give soldier *** 1/2 out of *****
