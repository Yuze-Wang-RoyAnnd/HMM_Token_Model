this supernatural peter weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen. richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer who defends a group of young aborigins accused of murder. as he gets closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, chris, and not least about himself. chris tells him that he is a mulkurul, which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in australia thousands of years ago. at the same time, extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last wave, the one that will drown the world.<br /><br />the dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience. olivia hamnett and david gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays charlie, the old aborigin who can turn into an owl. the climax and the ending don't disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so. however, this can not be called a pure thriller. it is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. a masterful work by peter weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
