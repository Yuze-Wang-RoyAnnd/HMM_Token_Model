was lucky enough to be an extra in this great film and loved every minute of the filming. went to the premier in london and had a great chat to phil, peter, martin, and jon as did my wife.fantastic after party too. then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. what a brilliant film, it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films. now we have the dvd sue my wife can't get enough of it neither can the kids. get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think i'm a film star now oh well one can only dream. i think they are just jealous. the only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain but hey we was in wales. hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me posted jon. danny beck
