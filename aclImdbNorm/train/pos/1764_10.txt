steve carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 year old virgin, having only had supporting roles in such films as bewitched, bruce almighty, anchorman, and his work on the daily show, we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that carell truly makes his own. you can tell that will ferrell influenced his "comedic air" but carell takes it to another level, everything he does is innocent, lovable, and hilarious. i would not hesitate to say that steve carell is one of the next great comedians of our time.<br /><br />the 40 year old virgin is two hours of non-stop laughs (or 4 hours if you see it twice like i did), a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie. the script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all. the music fit the tone of the movie great, and you can tell the director knew what he was doing.<br /><br />filled with sex jokes, some nudity, and a lot of language, this movie isn't for everyone but if you liked the wedding crashers, anchorman, or any movie along those lines, you will absolutely love the 40 year old virgin.
