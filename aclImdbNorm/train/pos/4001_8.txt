this is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity. anne reid, previously best known in the uk for her tv roles including 'dinnerladies' (a victoria wood scripted series on in-company catering workers, if you're wondering), gives a performance of finely judged understatement as may, a late-60s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an inner-london borough. her husband toots (peter vaughan) dies on their visit to the male of the latter species (bobby), and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by bobby and his family. may's teacher daughter paula (cathryn bradshaw) lives nearby, however, and the relationship between may and paula initially appears closer. thus when may decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to london, she is able to stay in paula's house and do some child-minding of paula's more appreciative offspring.<br /><br />it is on may's visits to bobby's house that she embarks on an affair with darren, a mid-30s friend of bobby who is working on a house extension. in what may be the first mainstream british film to so portray it, it is may and not darren (daniel craig*) who initiates the encounter, and, at least to begin with, it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect. there is no explicit sexual content (at least in the dvd i saw: differences in the imdb cast list suggests the existence of other versions), and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively. more strongly portrayed is the relationship between may and daughter paula, a recent convert to 'therapy and self-exploration', who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her. paula is also darren's lover, and when she finds may's explicit but rather poor drawings of darren and may together, things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion. only in an english film, perhaps, could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother, politely ask her to stand up, and duly wallop her.<br /><br />in the mean time, may is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older (of her own generation) member of paula's writing group. the contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with darren is clearly made; it is at that point that may starts to acquiesce to paula, and darren's worm begins to turn (he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money, if not all along, but for some of the ride). so may finds herself superfluous to both of her children's needs, and finally does return home (but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures new).<br /><br />the film's strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parent-sibling relationships, where bereavement may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had no-one to care for them. this is not new, but the openness of the portrayal of sexual need in the over-60s may well be. the darkness of the film's content, from a screenplay by hanif kureishi, stands in contrast to the way in which it is lit (it seems to be perpetual summer), and the overall mood is uplifting - it could so easily have been yet another piece set in a dour and rainy england. the ending is perhaps under-written, as we don't know where may is going or for how long - perhaps she's shirley valentine with a pension, she's certainly no picasso. anne reid is, however, revealed as a fine actor whose professional life will surely have changed forever. like julie andrews in torn curtain (said by paul newman), "there goes your mary poppins {read dinnerladies} image for good".<br /><br />* yes, he: announced oct 2005 as the new james bond.
