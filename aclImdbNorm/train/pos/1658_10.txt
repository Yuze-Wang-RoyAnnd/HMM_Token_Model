if you've seen this movie, you've been to puerto rico. i've lived in puerto rico all my life, and have to shamefully admit that we (pr) are living a real chaos right now, drugs being the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day. these people will shoot anyone, anytime and anywhere, and many innocent lives have been lost because of this. we don't feel safe anymore, and in addition to this, our so-called "justice" is no longer moved by truth and rightness, but by money, influence and power. "ladrones y mentirosos" is based on real, deplorable facts, and truly portrays puerto rico's three main problems: the drug-related killings, money and power manipulating our courtrooms, and innocent people and children being corrupted and even dying because of this. ricardo and his wife poli, with their true-to-life plot and their award winning direction(**), were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is: puerto rico is a beautiful and friendly country, living a nightmare that doesn't seem to end !!! ** they recently won the "copper wing award" for best director in the world cinema competition at the 2006 phoenix film festival.
