"the plainsman" represents the directorial prowess of cecil b. demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok (gary cooper), buffalo bill cody (james ellison), calamity jane (jean arthur), george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact, even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. truly, this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.<br /><br />transfer: considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. all in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good
