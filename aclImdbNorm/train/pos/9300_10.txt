i don't know much about the rat pack, and frank sinatra always seemed a bit too self-consciously full of himself to me. so when i call this one of my all-time faves, it's nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality. as another reviewer says, mad dog time is about symbolism, not realism. it's kafkaesque (a pity kyle maclachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd, when he was so good as josef k), it's stylish, knowing, sardonic and slick. jeff goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters, trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily, trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others don't, whom he can outshoot and whom he can't. gabriel byrne and richard dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball, and the supporting cast look spot-on. the symbolism, the settings (the one outdoor motion shot with jeff goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry), the dialogue (style, not practicality, is the order of the day), it's all about characters interacting, not really gangsterism. fun to watch, must've been fun to do. what the critics were up to is really a mystery...
