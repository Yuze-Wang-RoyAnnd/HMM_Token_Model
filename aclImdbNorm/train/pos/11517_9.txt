if you enjoy cleese & all the british 'pythonesque' humour of the time, then this little gem is absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />arthur lowe is a real treat!<br /><br />i saw this with friends on tv when it first came out, and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years, and will do forever! i have it on tape and it is continually appreciated.<br /><br />perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously.<br /><br />i can't believe it is now only available in the us (ntsc of course), and not in uk, where it should be an essential part of the history of british humour!!
