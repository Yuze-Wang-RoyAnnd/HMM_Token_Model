i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb. it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb. at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards i am trying for vcd of this film but i am unable to find it. huge african lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them. all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film. but some scenes involving mccomb forces parental guidance for this film. it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all.
