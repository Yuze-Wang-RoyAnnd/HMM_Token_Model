yeah, it's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow, but it's actually pretty good - and i consider myself a manly man. you gotta love judy davis, no matter what she's in, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural, convincing performance.<br /><br />the scenery of the small, coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie. the unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention. overall, i give it an 8/10. go see it.
