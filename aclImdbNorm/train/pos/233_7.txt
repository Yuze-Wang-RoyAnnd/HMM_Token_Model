i actually found this movie 'interesting'; finally one worth my time to watch and rent. it is true... some scenes were over the top on emotionalism, shouting, etc., but what movie doesn't stress its agenda, genre or 'ax to grind'? almost none! what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a s.fran reviewer on another review site, but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his "own" review of the movie; not of the movie at all. anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends; no car chases, yea!! being "in" an italian family myself, i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen. the movie has its tear jerking parts as well. it is what real life can be in such an environment. nice movie.
