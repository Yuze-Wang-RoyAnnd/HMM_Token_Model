this was my favourite film as a child, and i have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and i doubt anybody could ever re-make the story of oliver twist on screen, any better than this one did.<br /><br />my all-time favourite ''bad guy'' has to be oliver reed as bill sikes. not only did he scare the life out of my when i watched it as a 6 year old, but now as a woman i can empathize more with nancys character, the bar maid/prostitute who helps oliver get the life he deserves.<br /><br />jack wilde as the artful dodger, was fantastic, and i don't think anybody could ever out-do him, as the street-pocket picker, and best friend of fagin. the music is fantastic, especially fagin's numbers, i'm also quite thankful they didn't give bill sikes a musical number, it wouldn't of worked with him being such a sinister character.<br /><br />i think carol reed did an excellent job of nancy's sticky ending, keeping it a g rated movie by disguising her beating, but giving enough away to show the violence of bill towards her. <br /><br />this movie is both charming, and charismatic as a musical sing-along, as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life.
