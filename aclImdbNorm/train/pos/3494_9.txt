for what it is, "raising victor vargas" is about as close to perfection as a film can get. either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked (probably some of each), this simple little slice-of-urban-life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds. the film begins with a strong flavor of "street" but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another. in my experience, never has so much been done with so little (cast of tyros, novice director, etc.). praised by the critics but not for everyone, "raising victor vargas" is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness.
