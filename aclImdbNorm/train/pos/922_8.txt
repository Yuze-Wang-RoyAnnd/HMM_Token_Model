at least for a half hour a week. i haven't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks (abc/cbs/nbc) in years. all of the lions are interesting, although larry can get annoying at times. i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter. most of the other characters are interesting as well. the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times, too. the animation is top notch, and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show. usually when they hire big names to star in a show, they're trying to hide a poor script or characters. not entirely true in this show though, there's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting, but overall the characters stand on their own.<br /><br />this is definitely for 16 and up. there's nothing here that most kids haven't already heard before though, and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads. it's definitely not as crude and edgy as south park, but does bring some of the same "bash everyone" feel to it. one example is that it makes fun of both dick cheney and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode. <br /><br />father of the pride and other dreamworks productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of animaniacs, pinky and the brain, and freakazoid. it's the same type of humor grown up. it may not be as witty as spielberg's classic tv series, but it's still good.<br /><br />i hope that it finishes this season off well, and is renewed for future seasons. otherwise i may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again.
