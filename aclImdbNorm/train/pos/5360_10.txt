amongst the standard one liner type action films, where acting and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. if the person in charge of casting were to have put "good" actors in this flick, it would have been worse(excepting richard dawson who actually did act well, if you can call playing yourself "acting"). i love this movie! the running man is in all likelihood god's gift to man(okay maybe just men). definitely the most quotable movie of our time so i'll part you with my favorite line: "it's all part of life's rich pattern brenda, and you better f*****g get used to it." ahh, more people have been called "brenda" for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine.
