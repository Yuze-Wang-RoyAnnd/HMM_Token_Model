you'd be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie (especially one entirely located inside a us prison) - see this to prove yourself wrong! it was produced in the 80's after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert (something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to $100m+ budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind!) being mr harlin's first major production and the - at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar - cast. i still think most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard's screen appearances (not mentioning the well overrated mr(s) bergman directorial efforts) - at least for all female viewers - but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense. do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror puff, imo it's definitely worth it!
