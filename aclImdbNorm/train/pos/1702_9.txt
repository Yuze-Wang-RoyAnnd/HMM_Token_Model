if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating. but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyone,<br /><br />just people with a sense of humor.<br /><br />for those people the movie is great! it plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows long gone, most of witch where b-rated themselves. along the lines of spaceballs and airplane 2, you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes, but it is well worth it.
