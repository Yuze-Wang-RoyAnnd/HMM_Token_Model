just saw the movie, and the scary thing was, the people talking during the movie sounded just like the actors. the movie had its moments, but also lagged and was rather sick. it was all meant to be a farce, but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie, you think to yourself "people like this are all around us" all attempts at getting the audience's sympathy are dashed as the actors do one stupid thing after another. on the plus side, there are some great (and funny) insults. i think i would wait for video- but it was a good laugh. warning- jerry takes his shirt off during the movie!! (not a pretty sight!)
