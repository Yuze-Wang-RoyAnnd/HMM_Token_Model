if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot, then this film is not for you. nope--you'll hate it. however, for those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, then you'll have a nice time watching this slight film.<br /><br />tony randall works for the irs and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return. however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is thrilled to have company. they dote on him and treat him like one of the family,...and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter, debbie reynolds. that's really about all the plot there is. but the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting. a really nice little curio from the late 1950s.
