one of b- and c-movie producer roger corman's greatest cult classics was the ramones vehicle (originally designated for cheap trick), rock n' roll high school. it's just a simple, technically dated story (but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made napoleon dynamite characters funny--see eaglebauer's van) about teenagers who love rock n' roll.<br /><br />students at vince lombardi high school are met with resistance by the evil principal, miss evelyn togar (played by cult classic favorite, mary woronov) who fears that rock n' roll turns kids into uncontrollable, amoral deviants and vows to make a rock n' roll-free zone. actually, she intends to wipe out rock n' roll for all students, regardless of whether its at school, and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successful.<br /><br />but not if riff randell (pj soles) can help it. a ramones fanatic, she has written some songs (including rock n' roll high school) that she wants to give to the ramones, and in trying to do so, is rebuffed by miss togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the ramones play in town. it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun-hating adults and the teenagers (in an ending that is reminiscent of over the edge, somewhat). after the years of punk, when the fame of garage rockers, the ramones (and others) would mark another shift in music evolution, it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous, exaggerated way.<br /><br />it is mostly mild comedy, but a great feel-good comedy nonetheless when you're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you. with jerry zucker (of airplane fame) and joe dante (of gremlins fame) both taking part in some of the directing, you can get the idea for what kind of humor you're in for (and not to mention, expect to see dick miller even if only for a few minutes in the film's finale). the story must've later inspired (and was consequently updated) by the mid-90s comedy, detroit rock city, which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers, kizz.<br /><br />i would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle, rock n' roll high school forever, released nearly a decade later. the original is still the best.
