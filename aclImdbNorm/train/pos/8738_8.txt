a bugs life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too. the story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food ( a mirror of the magnifiscent seven). there is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too. you will love it!! 8 out of 10
