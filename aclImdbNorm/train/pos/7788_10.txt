i love ashley judd and think all of her movies are great. ruby<br /><br />in paradise is one of her best. it is a very understated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it. a story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy. some of her movies such as kiss the girls and time to kill probably did better at the box office and video rentals. they were very good movies<br /><br />also, but take the time to really look at ruby and i think you will agree it is one of ashley's best.<br /><br />
