in late 1800s san francisco, poor well-dressed errol flynn (as james j. corbett) works at a bank, and enjoys attending local "fights" (boxing) with co-worker and drinking buddy jack carson (as walter lowrie). one day, pretty alexis smith (as victoria ware) walks into the "comstock bank", where mr. flynn works. flynn is so taken with ms. smith's elegant beauty, he offers to carry her withdrawal purse. smith is secretly taken with the handsome flynn, but is put off by his brashness.<br /><br />flynn's good deed (actually, pick-up attempt) gets him a complimentary membership in the snooty "olympic club", which conveniently includes a gymnasium (with boxing equipment). however, flynn's presumptuous manner, and practical joking (he tickles men on the parallel bars) irritates "club" members. when an english boxing champ visits the club, members endeavor to get flynn to fight the man. they are hopeful flynn will resign, humiliated by his defeat - but, flynn wins! <br /><br />first time producer robert buckner puts together a nice package for warner brothers, and director raoul walsh. mr. buckner was, certainly, basking in the success of his contribution (screenplay) to the studio's brilliant "yankee doodle dandy". unfortunately, this story is positively ludicrous. there was a "gentleman jim" - this story is supposedly the filming of the real james j. corbett's autobiography "the roar of the crowd" - but, this movie must be significantly fictionalized.<br /><br />flynn is a very appealing leading man; he maneuvers the script lightly, and should have been recognized, by the early 1940s, as an excellent actor. many of flynn's characterizations were (are?) overlooked as great performances, and this is one of them. smith does well as his feminine interest, deftly transmitting her emotions for the viewer. director walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant. the supporting cast is a treasure trove, from boisterous alan hale (as pat corbett) to walk-on lon mccallister ("paging mr. corbett").<br /><br />******** gentleman jim (1942) raoul walsh ~ errol flynn, alexis smith, alan hale
