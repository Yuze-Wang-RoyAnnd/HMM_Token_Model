when i saw this movie first, it was long ago on vhs-video. i did like this movie, because it was funny and excitingly. some years ago i saw another movie, called: *andy colby's incredible adventure* in this movie were parts of *wizards of the lost kingdom* used in. they called this movie "kor the conquerer". i began to search for the "kor"-movie many years, because i wanted to see the complete movie, not only the parts which were used in the *andy colby*-movie. no shop had this kor-movie to rent and no shop did know this movie. many years i watched my old vhs-tapes i had at home, and what a wonder... i had this movie since many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in germany it has 3 or 4 titles. so i was happy to find this tape at home and this time i had much more time in watching *kor the conquerer again. the music is great during the hole movie, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment, when kor is walking drunken through the green forrest. the music in the background had some kind of magic. i like bo svenson, and also the boy, who played simon in the movie. both of them did their job very good. manfred kraatz, germany, 26.10.2004. thanks to all for reading my comment.
