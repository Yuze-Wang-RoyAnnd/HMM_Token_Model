this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone. on my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series, spirited away and fly away home.<br /><br />i can really relate to the main character jess. at the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. she really sucks you into her life. i also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.<br /><br />the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. the movie is never boring. the romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard! one thing that really made it though was the indian factor. jess' parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. the indian people are also hilarious! essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.<br /><br />feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. they're funny, they're refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~
