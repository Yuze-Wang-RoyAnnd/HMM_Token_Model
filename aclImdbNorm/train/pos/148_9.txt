like his earlier film, "in a glass cage", agust'i villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor. this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see. the heightened drama, intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical, yet never steps into it. in that way, it pulls off an almost impossible feat: to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged and yet so understated, and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye. unabashed, gorgeous, and highly tense... this film is simply superb!
