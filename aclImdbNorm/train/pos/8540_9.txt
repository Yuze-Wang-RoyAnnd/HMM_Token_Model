it's funny how your life can change in a second... to attend ''the waterdance'' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening, and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on. <br /><br />eric stoltz's performances and mainly of helen hunt (oh man!, helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth...) are wonderful, wesley snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. a film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: enjoy each moment of your life...<br /><br />really to a film as that the any hour is not attended!!! (sorry, it's a brazilian expression...).
