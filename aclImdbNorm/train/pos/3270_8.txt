writers perry and randy howze crafted a very engaging little story in "chances are." <br /><br />using the idea of a reincarnated man who happens to return to his former wife's home many years later, the plot takes unexpected, delightful turns.<br /><br />twenty four year old robert downey, jr. renders a delightful performance, ably assisted by cybil shepherd as the widow and ryan o'neal as a good friend. <br /><br />this trio has just the right chemistry for this caper, playing off one another with a graceful style. i've watched this film a number of times on tv, and each time found it most enjoyable.
