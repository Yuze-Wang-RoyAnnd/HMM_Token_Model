if your a fan of airplane type movies this is a must see! set in the 1920's and 30's johnny dangerously has not only great actors but great lines. "knock down dat wall,knock down dat wall and knock down dat #@$%#@$ wall." "you shouldn't hang me on a hook johnny" or "sounds like johnnys getting laid". its definitely a spoof of the old james cagney movies and references them a lot. there's a great scene when jhonnys walking down death row and has a priest set up for his escape. listen closely to the fake priests readings, its pretty funny. another great scene is when dom delauise plays the pope. watch his reaction to johnny after he tips the pope, a lot said without making a sound.i recommend this movie to all who love to laugh or are old movie buffs.
