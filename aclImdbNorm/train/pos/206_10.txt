i'm 14, so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that. boy are you wrong. i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it. i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten. i saw the movie oh, god recently and loved it. this one was also very awesome. george burns did a great job. so did walter matthau(this is the first time i've ever seen him perform). and even though they had really small roles, phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job. that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done. let me say this, if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau, you should see this movie right away!
