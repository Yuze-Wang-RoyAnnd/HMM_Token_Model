citizen x tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed "the rostov ripper" this great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer. the film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over 12 years. (possibly over 50 victims, mostly women and children) the performances of stephen rea as the lead detective and donald sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb. jeffrey demunn as the ripper andrei romanovich chikatilo. this is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case. this a film not to be missed. it debuted i believe on hbo and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding. great film
