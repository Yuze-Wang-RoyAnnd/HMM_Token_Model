i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as "just" entertainment. set right after the carefree, roaring 20s, during the early days of the great depression, dance, fools, dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale, with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times. yet this fast-paced and tightly-plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale.<br /><br />in the 30s, hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining *and* enlightening audience-pleaser after another, all without wasting a frame of film. dance, fools, dance -- one of *four* films that harry beaumont directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long, yet its characters are well developed, its story never seems rushed, and despite its many twists in plot, the audience is never left behind.<br /><br />with the lone exception of lester vail as flaccid love interest bob townsend, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. worthy of note are william bakewell as crawford's brother, cliff edwards (best known as the voice of jiminy cricket) as reporter bert scranton, and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake luva.<br /><br />but this is joan crawford's film, and she absolutely shines in it. made when she was just 27, this lesser-known version of crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work. however, here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce, crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself.<br /><br />score: eight out of ten
