not sure if it was right or wrong, but i read thru the other comments before watching the short.i have to say i disagree with most of the negative comments or problems people have had with it.<br /><br />as a first time "lone wolf" director/producer,i like to see things that i can aspire to,not necessarily from the pro's, but by people just getting their feet wet like me.<br /><br />if indeed this is also from a first-timer,as i read,i applaud the effort.marvelous job then in that respect! there were some comments about the music.i thought it was quite nice for the piece.some say it kind of droned along for a while, but i found that created tension without(us)necessarily being conscious of it, and when he pulled the gun out and the guitar started crunching chords,it was like we knew there was a train on the tracks, but realize it is just now moving. yes there is a 180 degree slip/clip in there, but shi* happens.did anyone else see hugh's dirty shirt turn white (near the end,in the rain) in "australia"? look how much money and people were behind that movie! give the kid a break for gods sake! all in all i think it was very well done. only 2 things i would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning-don't walk up to a shiny brass picture frame with the camera, and i would have just displayed the splatter at the beginning shots to a still shot, so people wouldn't necessarily know what it is.<br /><br />my experience so far has taught me that it's not that it's hard to make a movie,it just takes time to learn how to do it,then the time to actually do it, and then you better take some more time still to think of all the details you'll need to have shot before you call "post-production time!" imho, it looks like director/writer ryan jafri did his homework, and if this indeed is his first report card, i'd give him an "a". the rest of you report to the principals office for a whuppin'.
