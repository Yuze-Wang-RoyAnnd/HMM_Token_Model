of the spate of austen films from the 1990s, this is my favorite, more even than "persuasion," which was the one that converted me to austeniana. before seeing this "emma" i had seen two previous versions, but in one emma seemed all wrong, more like lady teazle, and in the other she seemed half wrong, like a possible impostor, whereas here she seemed just right, young and silly and stubborn. in general i thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well; indeed it is one of the sweetest, merriest things i have ever seen, rather in the nature of a christmas treat. the script is unusually well formed, and the adapter's additions, like the shaft of light that reveals harriet to emma in church, are all in keeping. mark strong as knightley is not what i would have expected, but i enjoyed him very much: he strongly brings out the plain-spoken, practical side of the character, in contrast with emma's affectations, and his choleric outbursts against frank churchill are quite funny. bernard hepton makes mr. woodhouse a figure of almost carrollian absurdity; samantha morton as emma's prot'eg'e is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she ought to be. and as in the same producers' "pride and prejudice," care is taken that the eventual couplings of characters can be believed--uniquely in some cases. for me this production was and remains a delight.
