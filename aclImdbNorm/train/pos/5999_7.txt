this is an odd film for me, as after i reviewed a nice film from a new film maker (far out by phil mucci), another writer/director, ryan jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film, the cure. i don't normally review films this way, but what the heck--i love shorts and couldn't wait to see another.<br /><br />interestingly, while it turned out i did like the cure, i was not thrilled by it and let jafri know. to his credit, he encouraged me to review it anyway--giving it my honest appraisal.<br /><br />the film has tremendous style and as far as jafri's direction goes, it's exceptional--especially for such an inexperienced film maker (it's his first film). the combination of exceptional choices of color, pacing and music that well-suited the film created a great sense of atmosphere. you really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making. however, the thing i didn't love was some of the writing. while the basic idea was great, the ending was just too easy to foresee. i really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist. however, considering that this film is from someone who shouldn't be able to make such a professional film given his experience, it bodes well for his future. good job.
