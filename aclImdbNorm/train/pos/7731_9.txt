<br /><br />"after dark, my sweet" is a strange mix of sensuality and dullness. the film runs slow, very slow, but takes a rythm to tell a story about murder and passion. jason patric never ever was so sexy and powerful (the man gives a true performance), and rachel ward is all but sexy.<br /><br />the sexual tension, the pshycological heat, the footsteps of the past... the flashback scenes, the weirdness of the patric's character, all becomes a sexy mystery. i recommend this one cause is the more sexy dull movie that i ever seen. check the love making scene, it's particulary sexy.
