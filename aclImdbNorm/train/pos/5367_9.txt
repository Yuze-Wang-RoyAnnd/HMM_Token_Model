this movie is one of the most underrated movie of its time. when watching this movie , your filled with action, and when somethings not really happing , the humour is un matched. brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix , of a game show where criminals are the contestants, and a near future where the general public all have a thirst for blood.also arnold doesn't let us down with some of his best one liners.i don't want to spoil anything for you ,but i will tell you when arnold gives his "i'll be back line" he gets the best response of them all in this movie. hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did.
