a wonderful film version of the best-selling book and smash broadway play about the lives of sadie and bessie delany, two african-american sisters who both lived over the age of 100 and told their story of witnessing a century of american history. ruby dee and diahann carroll give very good performances as bessie and sadie, respectively. amy madigan also is good as amy hill hearth, the white new york times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book, etc. many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present-day ones are very powerful, if not quite as inspirational as in the book. that is the only real drawback, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly, such as the inter-racial background of the sisters' mother and why their father was so stern. but other than that, a very well-done, excellently performed, powerful movie.
