kurosawa, fresh into color, losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on tokyo's slums. kurosawa stretches for a style that was, in my opinion, his antithesis- that is to say, i feel as if kurosawa wanted to make an ozu picture. poorly paced, poorly conceived, this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work. while ikiru, while being mundane and depressing, was still interesting and well paced, and while stray dog depicted the slums and social poverty of japan without being too heavy handed or boring, do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content, with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier kurosawa pictures.<br /><br />be warned, this is not a movie that kurosawa should be judged by.
