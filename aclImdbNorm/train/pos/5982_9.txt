one of my favourite films. it has everything - rocking soundtrack, courtesy of eddie clark, ex motorhead, loads of action, loads of laughs, totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful '80's stereotypes as characters. eddie, the put-upon nice guy, who just wants to be left alone to be different, leslie (about as wet as they come), nuke (the rock burn-out), eddie's mom (pathetic), roger (the geek) and ozzy as the preacher (surely he exists in america?). then there are the boys (rich, vicious and stupid) and the girls (vacant, vain and stupid). what more could you ask for?<br /><br />well, first of all, there's sammi curr, the rock star, an amalgam of every '80's badass rocker you can think of. what about that rocket firing guitar? then there's the scene where sammi pulls the old lady through the tv screen and smashes her up. and what does roger do? why, hoover her up, just like a good geek would. my favourite scene is where tim hainey gets his long overdue reward from sammi via the wet finger in the plug - magic!<br /><br />if you were into rock in the '80's or just love ridiculous films like i do, then check this one out. it's available on dvd and very cheap so (trick or)treat yourself.
