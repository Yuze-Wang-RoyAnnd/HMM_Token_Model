a visit by hitler in rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. sophia loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of hitler and mussolini. she has to stay at home since the family cannot afford a maid. she would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of il duce.<br /><br />there is one exception though. across the yard sits marcello mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide. the reason? he is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer. the film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend. loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands mastroianni and in a masterfully shot, directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected. the initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man, this anti fascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for.<br /><br />this is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever. loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed. this is a simple but yet powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement, things will change, someone has understood.
