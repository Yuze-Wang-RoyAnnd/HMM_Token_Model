it's nice to see a film with real people with honest feelings. sissy spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple, yet nice, daughter to robert farnsworth,<br /><br />who finally, in his last role, gets to show what a fine actor he was. it is hard to believe that this is a david lynch film. it is slow and even, sweet and moving. one of the best unless you like car chases, sex scenes, and violence.
