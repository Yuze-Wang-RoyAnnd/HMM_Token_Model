this movie pleasantly surprised me. it has a touching, slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention. this is a movie i never heard about, but if you want a "sleeper", this is it. great writing, production, and acting. i highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful. nick nolte, sheryl lee and alan arkin are marvelous. why wasn't more made of this movie?
