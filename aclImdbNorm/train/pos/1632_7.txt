misfits at a military school? hmmmm, sounds funny, maybe offensive to some. you have the characters there, the arab thief, the sex crazy teen, the smart mouth, the pot smoker, and not to forget, the guy who burns things. throw in a strict no nonsense sergent, a homosexual sergent and one sexy ammunition teacher and it makes one crazy film adventure.<br /><br />i have seen this film and it is funny, because the comedy is revolved around the fact that if you try to work together, things get done.<br /><br />these band of misfit students at weinberg military school have been placed in here because, as sgt liceman quotes "because you are outcasts, embarrassments to your families and communities, disgraces." one of ralph macchio's earlier performances before the karate kid and my cousin vinny, with appearances from barbara bach as well, this film appeals to teens and young adults.<br /><br />great soundtrack keeps the film moving.
