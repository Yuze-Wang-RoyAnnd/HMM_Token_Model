i first saw this version of "a christmas carol" when it first appeared on television. i actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations. i have now purchased the dvd and plan to watch it every year. with the exception of "it's a wonderful life" i consider this version of "a christmas carol" one of the best christmas movies ever made. george c. scott is excellent and a superb cast led by roger rees surrounds him! scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time. scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself. how can someone be remembered as both patton and scrooge? scott does so easily. the direction is marvelous with the fine sets, costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time, place and era depicted. you will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
