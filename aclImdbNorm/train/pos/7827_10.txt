this film is, quite simply, brilliant. the cinematography is good, the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking. this is the story of donald woods, a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid. kevin kline is completely convincing - so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later, i recognised him from kline's portrayal. denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance, as ever.<br /><br />i urge you to watch this. it is long, but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. remember, folks, this really happened.
