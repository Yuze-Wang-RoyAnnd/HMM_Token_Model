a famous conductor decides after a heart attack to go back to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. there, he comes in dutch with the local church choir, that will change his life.<br /><br />i had no expectations when i saw this movie for the first time yesterday; i like watching foreign movies that are not english, and i've already seen a couple of swedish movies in my life, but this one was the best so far.<br /><br />where to start? in my opinion, this film is a jewel, thanks to many things, of which one is the outstanding acting. michael nyqvist is perfect as the thoughtful, almost shy and devoted conductor daniel dar'eus. beautiful frida hallgren is enchanting with her pretty smile and her subtle acting. the choir members are all well-developed, interesting characters with their own story each.<br /><br />this movie tells a story, a beautiful story, about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who devoted his life to music, and who tries to create a calm existence in the village where he was born, while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been till then. kay pollack shows us that the swedish are outstanding movie creators. go see sa som i himmelen, it's a movie that makes you think about life and love, and that's also comforting, in some way.
