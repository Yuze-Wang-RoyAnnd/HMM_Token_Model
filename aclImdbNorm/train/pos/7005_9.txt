when its dvd was released i came to market and bought it. and i think my money was on right way as i expected before buying it. awesome movie what else i can say for will smith, he's been an awesome actor like always whether in actions movies or serious. always he gives a record braking performance. i think this is the movie after august rush which makes a person cry while watching it. the way the director described the story was really awesome. his previous life and his new life in movie was correctly elaborated to the audience. even i could not find any fault in the story or the way they shoot it. i think its dvd should be a household because this will be really a nice thing for your collection. it is not the movie which needs pop-corns for enjoyment, this is the movie which let the audience learn a lesson. now what is the lesson you can see that while watching. and i advise those people who are movie critics please watch this if you could find any criticism about this movie then please talk to me.
