"fanfan la tulipe" is still gerard philippe's most popular part and it began the swashbuckler craze which throve in the french cinema in the 1955-1965 years.it made gina lollobrigida a star (lollobrigida and philippe would team up again in ren'e clair"s "belles de nuit" the same year.<br /><br />"fanfan la tulipe" is completely mad,sometimes verging on absurd .henri jeanson's witty lines -full of dark irony- were probably influenced by voltaire and "candide" .antimilitarism often comes to the fore:"these draftees radiate joie de vivre -and joie de mourir when necessary (joy of life and joy of death)""it becomes necessary to recruit men when the casualties outnumber the survivors" "you won the battle without the thousands of deaths you had promised me, king louis xv complains,but no matter ,let's wait for the next time."<br /><br />a voice over comments the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride:height of irony,it's a genuine historian who speaks!<br /><br />christian-jaque directs the movie with gusto and he knows only one tempo :accelerated.<br /><br />remake in 2003 with vincent perez and penelope cruz.i have not seen it but i do not think it had to be made in the first place.
