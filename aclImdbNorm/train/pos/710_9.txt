while i don't agree with bob's and tammy's decision to give up baby jesse, and it's something i'd never do, they were trying to do what was best for the baby. the way this movie is written, you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe, from all different aspects. patty duke? antagonist? almost unheard of, as far as i'm concerned. but during the movie, she really convinces you that she's psychotic, or at least, that there's something seriously wrong with her. her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed." the movie seems to end quickly, leaving things somewhat unresolved. but other than that, this movie is really great. it really makes you think. it's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that'll make you laugh. but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from others' perspectives, and discover a little something about yourself. caution: you may even grow while watching this movie! and it's all worth it, in the end.
