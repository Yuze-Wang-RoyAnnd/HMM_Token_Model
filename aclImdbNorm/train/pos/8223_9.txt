when i first saw this film, in london, in 1958, i was bowled over. i had never seen a film like this before. it had a strange, hypnotic effect, quite unlike the films that i had seen previously and it left a lasting impact.<br /><br />i believe that odile versios & marina vlady are sisters, if not twins. certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer.<br /><br />if this has been converted to dvd - in region 2 format - and in the original french language, i would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased.
