saw this film on dvd yesterday and was gob-smacked and flabbergasted. the unaffected acting of ddl just blew my mind, and i was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting. all of the character were so authentic to me, i really took ddl for christy burns and brenda fricker for his mom. go and see it! you'll cry your heart out, but you'll experience a wonderful catharsis! besides, it teaches you one important lesson: determination is everything. you may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of dublin, but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problems at all. if you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer. the worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self-pity. it won't get you anywhere and the only person who'll pity you will be yourself.
