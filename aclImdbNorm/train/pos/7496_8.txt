<br /><br />i take issue with the other reviewer's comments for the simple reason that this is a mystery film, not a supernatural one! it is not the only film to have a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but turns out to be a very mundance one.<br /><br />other films that come to mind are edgar wallace's "before dawn" and the (more famous) "mark of the vampire". <br /><br />the film does a wonderful job in creating a very "spooky atmosphere", similar dracula, when renfield meets the count on the staircase of his castle, or in mark of the vampire, when the two people look thru the windows of the castle ruins and see a "corpse" playing an organ, while luna descends using wings! very surreal!<br /><br />if one likes these (often silent) atmospheric touches, this film is a must!<br /><br />norm vogel
