francesca annis, michael kitchen and robson green!! wow, what a trio...ok, so this is no anna karenina, but it is a good love story, very well-written and well-acted by all. even a few 'laugh-out-loud' moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity, age bias, and parental aging/alzheimer's issues.<br /><br />quirky guitar music added to the story as well.<br /><br />while i have been a fan of ms. annis' since 'lillie' (in the '70s) and mr. kitchen's since 'the buccaneers' and 'enchanted april', i have only recently discovered mr. green ('me and mrs. jones', 'touching evil', etc.), making me ask the question - why had i not seen 'reckless' until recently??!! admittedly more of a 'chick flick' than something a man will sit through, it is perfect for a rainy afternoon's lazy viewing.
