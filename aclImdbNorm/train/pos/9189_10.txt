let me start off by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on dvd at 10 o'clock p.m. one night, i could not fall asleep until about 3:00 a.m.<br /><br />this brief review may contain spoilers.<br /><br />i'm a long-time fan of the sopranos and i can safely say this is the best episode i've seen. i'm not saying everyone should feel this way, but i do. this episode is identical to the weekend i spent with my family, watching over my own father, comatose in the icu before he passed.<br /><br />the episode begins with tony in an alternate reality: he is a salesman who's identity has been mistaken for that of a man named kevin finnerty.<br /><br />by the time ten minutes had gone by, i knew either tony was dreaming, or i was watching some other show. it wasn't like the normal sopranos and i loved it.<br /><br />option 1 is confirmed when anthony (or "kevin") looks into the sky at a "helicopter spotlight" and we see prodding through it, a doctor with a flashlight. we see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we go back to real life in a situation similar to the one i just stated.<br /><br />tony has come out of the coma for only a moment. his boys take a.j. home and carmella, overcome by stress, breaks down in the hallway: a signature moment in the episode.<br /><br />for the remainder of the episode, we cut in between the real world: the family dealing with the potential negative outcome of this coma, and tony's alternate reality, which parallels what's going on both in his mind and in the real world around him.<br /><br />then comes the stellar point in the episode: after a.j. finishes telling his mother he's flunked school, she walks in to see meadow sitting at anthony's side.<br /><br />she approaches tony, and utters the best line of the episode: "anthony, can you hear us?" in tony's world, he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light. he takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. he tries to dial, but he cannot--as if he were trying to say something back to carmella, but couldn't physically bring himself to do so. not yet.<br /><br />he sits down and looks out his window. a shimmering light that has reoccurred throughout the episode now seems to call to him from the other side of the city.<br /><br />"when it's cold i'd like to die" by moby marries perfectly with these last images and helps in creating an emotional roller-coaster of an episode.<br /><br />10 out of 10.<br /><br />p.s.: watch the next episode. you find out what the light is. it's wonderful.
