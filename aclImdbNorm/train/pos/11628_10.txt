"i didn't want this to get complicated, leese. i have to assume she's gonna read that." fear takes flight at 30,000 feet in this taut, action thriller. an overnight flight to miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when lisa ( rachel mcadams) realizes her seatmate ( cillian murphy) is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot. as the minutes tick by, she's in a race against time to warn the potential victims before its to late.<br /><br />one of the many reasons i love this movie, is because of the chemistry between the two stars, mcadams and murphy, who are also two of my top favorite actors. for example, the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy: two people keep running into each other.... i got to hand it to the two as well, for making a film like this work. especially, murphy's character.. jackson who really seems to be sort of complicated in that way that he acts charming and innocent, yet he's trying to do his job and make lisa feel trapped physically and mentally. i mean, in certain parts he really seems to be concerned for lisa.<br /><br />a great thrill ride all the way through. a lot of films i would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about, but actually i wouldn't mind a prequel to this one, which would take place with jackson surveilling lisa. favorite scene is probably that headbutt scene, because it was so unexpected. there was also that nice buildup to the famous 'pen' scene. when is she going to make her move? there was also that nice change in mcadam's lisa, where she changed herself from being a victim into fighting back. i also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies a survey about the food court. how great was murphy with his whole weezing.....
