i used to write comments at imdb, but i don't do so anymore. it happens that imdb has become massive, and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores. what do i mean? that anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and doesn't have any expertise on the subject, watches some crap (or the opposite), and in case he likes it, delivers a 10, and if he doesn't he goes for a 1. this of course, cannot measure anything correctly. now for the film. i truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films, because then i must score this one with 12 or 13, which is not possible. this documentary has something that i don't expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film. it is simply mesmerizing, and it's not just a way of saying; it really is. the last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys-, that really... there's no possible match. i don't keep movies, rarely would i find any sense in doing so, but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by. i got nothing more to say. this is a genuine, objective 10 for me.
