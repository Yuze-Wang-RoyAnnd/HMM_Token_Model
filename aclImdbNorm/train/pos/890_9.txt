this is one excellent sammo hung movie. actually, this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema. the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up w/ a vicious pimp. the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well-defined. the story is involving and has enough romance, drama, comedy, and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes. sammo hung proves here that he's probably the best fight choreographer in the business. the action is simply amazing, esp. the fight w/ lau kar leung and the finale. billy chow and sammo hung are amazing. a must see for any fan of action.
