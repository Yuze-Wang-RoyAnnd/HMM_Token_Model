this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine, the fire on, and with your feet up. it doesn't require that much brain-power to follow, so is very good after a long day. i would say it is very unrealistic - if you expecting anything serious, then don't bother, but it is very funny. just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while, and then actually get to enjoy it... i would definitely recommend it.
