the movie was very moving. it was tender, and funny at the same time. the scenery was absolutely beautiful! peter faulk and paul reiser gave award winning performances. olympia dukakis was great. i understand due to the story line her part had to be brief, but i did wish i could have seen more of her-she is a true pro.you will be able to recall experiences from your own life , hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie. we were fortunate to see paul reiser at a q and a after the viewing. he is a wonderful man, clever, eloquent and a "real person". it was truly an enjoyable night out!this is a must see movie. you will be so grateful you went.
