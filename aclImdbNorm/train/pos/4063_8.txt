castle in the sky is undoubtedly a hayao miyazaki film. after seeing it for the first time i'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint. on the contrary, you get your time's worth, which means (as to what miyazaki's films are concern), that is nothing less than excellent! <br /><br />produced early in his cinematic career, castle in the sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helped out by very interesting (and some times lovable) supporting characters. and, of course, the usual battle of nature versus civilization, flying machines (lots of it!!), beautiful painted sceneries
