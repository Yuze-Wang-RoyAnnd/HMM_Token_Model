we watched this on "the wonderful world of disney" on abc last night, and i came to the conclusion that things must be tighter there at "the mouse" than usual. <br /><br />since this movie only runs 74 minutes, and they had to pad it out to 2 hours of broadcast television time, they had, and i'm not making this up, commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes. and during these commercial breaks, they had another advertisement in the guise of a "tv show" hosted by the oh-so-annoying kelly rippa that loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of "cinderella 2: dreams come true".<br /><br />again and again, break after break, disney took time out of the real movie to tell us, the loyal viewers, that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. thank you, disney, for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie.<br /><br />anyway, all this commercialism and cash-register-ringing made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie of "cinderella", because by the time the commercials were over, i had forgotten where the story had left off.<br /><br />but of course, the original "cinderella" still maintains its magic, and the story is still a good one, though we've all seen it countless times. it's a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow-up.
