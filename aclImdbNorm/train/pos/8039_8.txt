sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies. i remember movies about vietnam or wwii, lots of firing, everybody dies, bam bam. "sniper" takes war to a new level or refinement. the movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for - the helplessness of humans in the jungle, the hatred and eventual trust between beckett and miller, and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger. a seemingly low-budget film makes up for every flaw with action, suspense, and thrill, because when it comes down to it, it's just one shot, one kill.
