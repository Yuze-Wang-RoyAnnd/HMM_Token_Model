this has always been one of my favourite movies, and will always be. over the last few years i have become a 50's / 60's sci-fi freak, trying to collect all of the better ones that were made back then. i love lots of things about them from how corny they could be to how technically correct some of them were. the great colours and the sets get me going too. it's a pity when they re-make some of these good old movies; they nearly always stuff it up, - just look at the recent re-do of the day the earth stood still, it's utter garbage!! forbidden planet is one of the benchmark space films of all time, and now they're trying to re-make it too, and i shudder to think what the new one will be like! to my mind, some things, such as fantastic classic movies, should just be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts at telling simple stories, and giving people a thrill in the process. once they add all the techno-crap that we have available now, the film just seems to be more dog-meat from the hollywood sausage factory, - nothing special at all. by the way, i notice that the astronauts' uniforms in forbidden planet were also used for "queen of outer space"! that just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then, doesn't it? hey, less money and better films, hmmm....<br /><br />great performances in this movie from leslie nielsen, in a serious role, and anne francis, walter pidgeon (who has always been one of my favourite actors), earl holiman, and of course robby the robot!<br /><br />the special effects are fantastic, and the storyline is not too far-fetched. this is a great sci-fi experience!
