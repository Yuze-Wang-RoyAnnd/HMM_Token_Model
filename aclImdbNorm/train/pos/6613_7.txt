a very unique sci-fi animated film, and frankly i love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be, better or worse. this french film is quite interesting to watch, the technique part is innovatory, like "waking life" i recently watched.<br /><br />it took me quite a long time to get used to the black-white style, but eventually i love it, the sketchlike images are really fancy! the contracted future world is a symbol of human race's final destination which i adore it very much.<br /><br />the whole plot is fine for a sci-fi, not so intriguing but it's ok, like some hollywood's products, a giant conspiracy about human's eternity, a little bit clich'e and the twisted ending is not so convincing, some development is just too plain and insipid, and the whole movie is too long.<br /><br />so i think i'm just in love with the style this film shows, others are not so good.<br /><br />about the eternity of life, i think most people have come to a unanimousness that we don't want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life, we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos. leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking, but that's also a way to show our lives are genuine and all the emotion fulfills one's life and make the world colorful and lively.
