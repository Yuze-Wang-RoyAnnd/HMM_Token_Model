barbra streisand is a tour de force in this hollywood story. her performances and the songs are one-of-a-kind and are special in the halls of great movies. the scene where she is introduced to the unexpecting audience by kristopherson, against the crowds' wishes and hers, only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of "woman in the moon" is one of the best examples on film of how well a great performer can win over an audience. it's real. the scene where she records evergreen ranks with the best in the business.. all live, no lip-sync, very special. streisand is often criticized for being a diva, but she delivers on this one. she is majestic singing "with one more look at you. she deserved the oscar she and paul williams got for evergreen. kristopherson had his moments too, far above most of his movie appearances. this version of the "born" franchise ranks with the first one of 1937 (janet gaynor, frederic march)although i will always enjoy judy garland and james mason musical remake of 1954. i haven't seen the dvd yet and don't know about its quality.
