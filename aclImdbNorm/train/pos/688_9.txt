i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed. tess nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films. if she could do what she did with the budget of this film, i'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture. kudos to the cast for their terrific performances (that little girl was gold), and to whoever composed the music. the warped "row your boat" blew me away. very creative film all around....i really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because i'd buy it in a second. if you get the chance, you should definitely see this film.
