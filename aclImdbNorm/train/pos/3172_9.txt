debut? wow--cross-eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that i've watched in the past year, making it hard to believe that cross eyed is the writer's debut film. i mean--i logged onto imdb to find more films by this writer...because cross eyed has that unique signature --you want to see what else this writer might have to say. these days, its rare to see a movie that is well-written, well-directed, well-edited and well-acted. for me--cross eyed encapsulates what movie making should be about--combining the best of all film elements to create a clever, artistic and poignant tale. more, please.
