in 1993, with the success of the first season of batman: the animated series, warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie, originally slated for direct-to-video, but bumped up to theatrical status. it would become known as batman: mask of the phantasm. ten years after phantasm, we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the wb, sub-zero, return of the joker, and now, mystery of the batwoman joins the family.<br /><br />the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm: a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin. now, batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line.<br /><br />the animation is the sleeker, futuristic style that was utilized for batman: the animated series' fifth and sixth seasons (aka the new batman adventures). , it's quite nicely done, and just as sleek as return of the joker's animation. there is also some use of cgi, but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub-zero. the music was alright. different and exotic and similar to the justice league score, although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent-shaped hearts.<br /><br />kevin conroy, as always, does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman. it's also great to have the old batman: the animated series alumni back; that includes bob hastings (commissioner gordon), robert costanzo (detective bullock), tara strong (barbara gordon/batgirl; her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond), and efrem zimbalist jr.(alfred).<br /><br />villains were also great - especially given that rupert thorne, the old mob boss from the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season.<br /><br />overall, while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago, motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films. and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan, you will love the five-minute short chase me.
