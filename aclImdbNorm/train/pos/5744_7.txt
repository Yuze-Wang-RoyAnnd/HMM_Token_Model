this was on at 2 or so in the morning one saturday a few years ago, for various reasons i don't remember the entire story but what remains are the two standout performances from the central characters. dom has had a unfortunate lot, manipulated & literally working a rubbish job, eugene torn between personal aspirations and duty towards his sibling. tom hulce' dom doesn't plead for sympathy - it comes naturally. ray liotta is a universe away from henry hill, displaying a soft centre in what must feel a thankless position.<br /><br />in many ways this deals with the dilemma many young carer's face - the past or the future. as it turns out, with some work the two can happily co-exist. thoughtfully handled & sensitively played dominick & eugene is difficult not to warm to.
