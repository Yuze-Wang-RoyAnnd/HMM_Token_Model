holy crap this is so hysterical! why aren't american comedies written like this? for anybody who thinks comedy has to be dumb-- there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels! hugh laurie is a complete hoot. i couldn't believe it was the same guy as house! there are so many great lines and gags in this series you could watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things each time. rowan atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put upon butler edmund. this is my favorite of all the blackadder series. and tony robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat obtuse heart of the series, "the oppressed mass" baldrick. some of my favorite lines: "when someone messes with a wellington he really puts his foot in it" and baldrick explaining how he got his name and cousin macadder "the top kipper salesman" and homicidal swordsman from scotland.
