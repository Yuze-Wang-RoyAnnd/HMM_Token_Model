'loulou' delights in the same way an expensive, high quality french wine does. it leaves you with a very fine aftertaste.<br /><br />'loulou's theme isn't new. the film doesn't carry an original plot either. its colored picturing shows fine, but not extraordinary. its setting is serious. its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind.<br /><br />whatever one further may say about 'loulou', it's beyond doubt that this very french film stands out for its excellent acting. the three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and tenses sparkling between them, making the plot alive. their acting fully invites you to participate, to make friends.<br /><br />for those around at the time, 'loulou' also provides an extra bonus: its perfectly captured mood of 1980.
