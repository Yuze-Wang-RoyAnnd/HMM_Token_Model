it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team. there are no parents or teachers to speak of, no school, and boys are represented by one peripheral figure, the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused.<br /><br />pauline aquart is the youngest of the three, only aspiring to join the team she so much admires. she's kind of odd looking. she's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long, bony limbs, big feet, and no derriere to speak of. she's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips. after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling.<br /><br />adele haenel is older -- more, well, more developed physically. what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit, sauntering around, teasing the boys, swishing her long blond hair. but she's not what she seems. or is she? i couldn't quite figure it out. the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency. no wonder francois is always sniffing after her.<br /><br />there's not so much ambiguity in louse blachere's character. she's on the team too but she's dumpy and plain, and sensitive about it, and has an intense crush on francois. blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance.<br /><br />the movie deals with the relationships between these three, meaning intrigues, deceptions, hidden feelings, and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another. this is of course a tricky topic. it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele. not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie. the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on, and what little sex there is under the covers, sometimes literally.<br /><br />i don't think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much, partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action, partly because it's complex, and partly because i'm not sure i got it all.<br /><br />let me give an example. okay. adele is the girl the others envy. she's also quite distant and self satisfied. on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all, from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from. she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio. when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team, adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys. a superior and self-indulgent narcissist, you know? but then the soi-disant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she's still a virgin. really? yes, really. pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her. pauline, now drawn sexually to adele, performs the task with subdued relish. now adele would really like to get it on with a man, preferably older and experienced. so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room. the two girls stand there staring at one another, neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other. but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins, reaches up, and kisses adele on the lips. adele steps back, smiling, and says, "there now, that wasn't so bad, was it?", and then walks back into the club.<br /><br />that's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele -- but what the hell is going on? initially, adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child, later like a close friend, finally like a potential lover -- and the minute pauline responds, adele walks off satisfied. is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men? does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? i don't know.<br /><br />i've slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio, the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity, but i've only skipped her for considerations of space.<br /><br />should you see it? by all means. (just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids.) for men, some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique, this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot.
