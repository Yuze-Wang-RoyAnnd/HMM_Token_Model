as someone who was born to a german mother and english father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) i come from unique position. one of having to deal with the various nazis on one side of the family and the victors of ww2 on the other. this miniseries cannot delve into every single part of hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can hitler's state of mind. in this the series does quite well. carlyle is very good as is o'toole, i would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party because hitler did not do anything on his own. he had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. what was going through goebbels, goring and hess's mind? it would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. but i hope it will make people research the subject more. it might also make people understand why someone like saddam hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.
