an overblown melodrama typical of its period (mid-1950s) and appropriate matin'ee food. rock hudson, the hulk everyone always falls in love with, plays his usual stereotype role, but whereas in giant, made the same year, when his material and co-stars (taylor & dean) were above average, in this movie he is just not good enough to raise the calibre beyond a mushy tale of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy. the self-destructive brother and sister (robert stack, reeling his way through the film in a drunken stupor, and dorothy malone, playing a vampish poor little rich girl totally over the top) end up the losers and hudson gets bacall - who is rather wooden in this part which does not have enough character or wit to get her going. to paraphrase oscar wilde, the good end happily and the bad unhappily, that is the meaning of fiction. however, i was interested to read that the film is based on a true story which vindicated the plot. like other films of the period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. maybe the film could be remade: stack's character would ring truer if he was hiding homosexual feelings for mitch by marrying. todd haynes's far from heaven greatly improved on all that heaven allows , also directed by sirk. perhaps haynes could remake written on the wind and give us a truly memorable film.
