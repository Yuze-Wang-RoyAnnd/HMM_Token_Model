well, it's yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film. but i'm a sucker for those so i gave it a good score... the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling. the violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change. i'd have given it a 9 if it were not for the salute at the end! all in all a good movie with very good actors.<br /><br />
