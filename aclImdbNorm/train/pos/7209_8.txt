i've bought certain films on disc even though the second rate presentation wasn't an option. a certain company i won't identify here has put out several pan and scan dvds ("clean and sober", "star 80", and this one, to name just three!) of films i don't think anyone wants to see in this compromised format. some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are just in their theatrical release 1.66:1 ratio.<br /><br />that off my chest, i'll say "deathtrap" was a spooky and oddly enough, amusing picture. my only complaints are the tinny score (what is that f____g instrument that is usually dragged out for films set in 18th century france?) and dyan cannon screaming at regular intervals. couldn't her character have been an asthmatic who grabbed for an inhaler when she was stressed? minor complaints, both. the benefits of discs include being able to fast forward to get beyond those things which you don't like.<br /><br />i never saw a staged version of "deathtrap", so having these folks in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time. before broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg, the theatre was more affordable to average people. now, anyone paying less than a king's ransom to get live entertainment probably isn't going to a hit show on the great hyped way.<br /><br />michael caine and christopher reeve were both large, virile specimens in the early 80s and that's integral to how we'll react to their profession and overall image here. they're definitely not bookish men who can't fight or will back down from an obstacle. the two are equally great as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate "deathtrap".
