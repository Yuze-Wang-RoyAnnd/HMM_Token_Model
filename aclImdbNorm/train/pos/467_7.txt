this film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best. the scenario is based on the novel by vladimir nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /><br />the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both turturro and watson. turturro definitely gives his best performance to date proving he's worth much more than what we thought. watson also performs brilliantly.<br /><br />the story is about a phenomenal chess player (turturro) which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. the film is presented in a non linear time, with multiple flashbacks of luzhin's childhood. through those, the complex character of luzhin is described. <br /><br />i have nothing more to say, but to suggest this film to anyone.
