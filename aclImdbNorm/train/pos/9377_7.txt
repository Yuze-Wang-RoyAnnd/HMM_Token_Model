a surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad. a great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a twin peaks-ish influence in director dahl. nicholas cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do. j.t. walsh (rip to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as is dennis hopper. it's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz. i'm sure he has his followers, though. in all, this is a great film that shows you that you don't need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film.
