an unusually straight-faced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. imperfect, as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget, but the drama is involving-- it's one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax 2 or more max or whatever they call it, you end up watching 40 minute blocks when you're supposed to be going to work. along w/ "deathstalker 2", "chopping mall", and "the assault", a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow low-budget brethern, who has a real ability to pace a genre film, when he actually's interested in the material (i.e., don't bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a 3 or a 4 after the title!) actors who've had too little to do recently (mancuso, ford, even gary sandy for chrissakes) really put their all into some of their best roles in years -- as for grieco, he has the right look, although his acting is a bit one-note -- it's clear his character is supposed to be self-destructing throughout the film, but grieco doesn't quite convey it. i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote "sorority house massacre 2" & "dinosaur island" for the director -- both minor classics in their own rights, but obviously "silly" roger cormon-like cinema -- this one's more like some of the better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan b-pictures of the 70's -- giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time -- a real step forward. not "citizen kane," and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive, but a well-written, character-driven above-average straight-to-video actioner. small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along, which is rare enough (as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert pyun monstrosity called "heatseeker" the other night -- this low-budget stuff isn't as easy as it looks -- but that's another story!)
