heres a fun fact, i was the baby in the movie, the one in the crib. :) i am 19 years old now. my parents took me to try out for the part, we lived in texas at the time.i think i only made like 80 bucks for it, but i wasn't in it very long. my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry. i was all mixed up. strange and funny fact i suppose.. and no i am not a child actress. i am livin' in san antonio, workin' at a walgreens. i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life. this movie is a great movie, though, good concept. i have seen it several times in my short 19 years.
