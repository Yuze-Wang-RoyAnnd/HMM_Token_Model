i should admit first i am a huge fan of the dandy warhols, and that is the reason i came watching this film.<br /><br />the uniqueness of this film, compared to other modern rockumentaries, is that it's not just about one page of a band's history (like "i am trying to break your heart", about wilco), but rather covers long period of the band's history. in this movie, director/producer ondi timoner closely followed friends/rivals the brian jonestown massacre (bjm) and the dandy warhols (dw) for more than 8 years (1995 - 2003) and shoot tremendous 1500 hours of raw video, cut than to 1:45 hours (the future dvd release will contain much more material than the original film). the result is astonishing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and genuine archive footage, which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands, through all these years.<br /><br />both bands in the start of their careers promised to "make a revolution" in the music making, and not to sell their souls to the devil of "record industry". however, their paths quickly diverged - the dandy warhols signed a contract with capitol records and became relatively popular (especially in europe) after only one album, while the brian jonestown massacre (with its self-destruction-bound leader anton newcombe) dissolved into oblivion (at least how it is portrayed in the film). and the movie follows the descent of the brian jonestown massacre, contrasted by the ascent of the dandy warhols.<br /><br />first, i was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of anton newcombe (for example, courtney taylor - the leader of the dandy warhols - narrates), but after some thinking i realized that something is wrong with this film.<br /><br />first, it treats anton newcombe as a disappeared person. the project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups, in which anton newcombe and ondi timoner were equal partners (that was the reason why all these years ondi timoner had unmediated access to the both bands). it was anton newcombe who brought the dandy warhols into the project. in the end he was ignored completely, as if he was kicked out of the project. everybody talk about bjm, but he does not take part in the discussion. i guess he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process. there are always both sides of the story, and here we have only one... of course, as one would expect, anton does not approve the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends.<br /><br />second, the film is very dandy warhols-biased. sure, the winner takes it all, but the fact that courtney taylor (leader of dw) narrates (even though it seems a good choice - it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement) and that bands' late history is represented nonproportionally (bjm is covered till 1997, and dw - till 2003), does not add objectivity to the film.<br /><br />third, the movie is (somewhat) shallow. what does it want to teach us? as one critic said: "... movie examines old questions: where does genius fit into a commodified world? can it thrive and get its due, or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity?" no, it does not examine these questions! it just depicts a story of a brilliant, but unsuccessful musician, narrated by a less brilliant, but successful one, who indulges in self-assurance and eternal coolness of an ego greater than mountain.<br /><br />anyway, the movie was fun - it's raw, it's fresh, it's stylish, it's ... just god damn interesting, at least for the dw or bjm fans. for the rest of the crowd - i don't know...
