this movie is damian szifr'on's second immersion in movies after his excellent character study in "el fondo del mar". with "tiempo de valientes" he creates extremely well done characters, far away from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. i've seen szifron's talent to present every character in a lighthearted way but just enough to involve us emotionally with them. his control over them is magnificent, so he restores on the movie a great direction and an overall brilliantly polished script, the characters laugh and cry with real sentiment and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on screen.<br /><br />the spanish takes over the english, the buenos aires urban landscape at night replaces hollywood sets and the premise is just as interesting as any other, so we have a film daring to compete over hollywood's machinery.<br /><br />but i want you to see the movie mainly because i've never dealt with such endearing characters, all of them. it seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa. i really believe with a film making like this argentina is really up to the competition.
