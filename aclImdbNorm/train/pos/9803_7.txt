this batman movie isn't quite as good as batman mask of the phantasm and batman and mr. freeze subzero but it is still a good installment to the batman cartoons i say it is equally good as batman beyond the movie. this movie is good for all the same reasons the storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice of actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman/ bruce wayne, tara strong as barbra gordon, efrem zimbalist jr., eli marienthal as robin. the villains are good such as kyra sedgwick as batwoman, david ogden stiers as the pequin, hector elizondo as bane. so i am sure you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the batwomen. so make sure that you rent or buy batman mystery of the batwoman the movie because it is really good.<br /><br />overall score: ******* out of ********** <br /><br />*** out of *****
