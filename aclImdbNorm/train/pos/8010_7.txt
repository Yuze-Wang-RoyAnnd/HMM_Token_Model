i previously thought that this film was the lamest of the muppet films. i would like now to retract that statement. in my opinion now, the lamest muppet film was the tv movie it's a very merry muppet christmas, am it's a wonderful life rip off that was truly dreadful. muppets take manhattan is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than merry muppet christmas. <br /><br />the best songs are that 'you can't take no for an answer' song, the one the muppet babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself. as i loved the muppet babies tv show, i loved the muppet babies sequence here (i'm told that it was what inspired the muppet babies show) <br /><br />the manhattan melodies show itself was the real showstopper, with muppets from sesame street even appearing for the wedding. as kermit puts it in his final line 'what better way could anything end?'. but i wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining. there are cute cameos from brooke shields and gregory hines and a great dance sequence from rizzo and the rats (choreographed by the late, great jim henson himself) and the film certainly entertains. i must state though that muppet movie, great muppet caper and muppet christmas carol are the three defininitive muppet movies.
