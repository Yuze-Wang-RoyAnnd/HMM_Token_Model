gary busey is the title character, frank "bulletproof" mcbain, your standard-issue reckless maverick cop who's earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes (38 and counting), he never stops going after the bad guys.<br /><br />when a cutting-edge u.s. tank dubbed "thunderblast" is driven across the border into mexico, it's nabbed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by general brogado (rene enriquez) and libyan colonel kartiff (henry silva), who's aligned himself with russian villains. the army personnel involved are kept as prisoners, chief among them devon shepard (darlanne fluegel), who happens to be mcbain's ex-girlfriend. mcbain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission.<br /><br />busey may not have the physical presence of say, someone like schwarzenegger, who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type, but he's a blast as a self- confident dude who's quick with the wisecracks. fluegel is a great female lead; she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt-kicking action babe. enriquez, silva, juan fernandez, and the always welcome william smith (as a russian major) are loathsome scum in the classic action movie tradition. the supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors: l.q. jones, r.g. armstrong, thalmus rasulala, lincoln kilpatrick, mills watson, luke askew, danny trejo, and cary-hiroyuki tagawa.<br /><br />t.l. lankford and b.j. goldman supply the script, based on a story by lankford and veteran b director fred olen ray. it's the kind of script where you just know the writers have their tongues in their cheeks: they know their material is absurd and cheesy, and just have fun throwing credibility out the window. veteran action director steve carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire, explosions, and general all-out mayhem.<br /><br />"bulletproof" is good fun for the action fan who doesn't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor.<br /><br />7/10
