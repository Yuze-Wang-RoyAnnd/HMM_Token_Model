every scene was put together perfectly.this movie had a wonderful cast and crew. i mean, how can you have a bad movie with robert downey jr. in it,none have and ever will exist. he has the ability to brighten up any movie with his amazing talent.this movie was perfect! i saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie shelf in "blockbuster" and like it was calling out to me,i couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me. you can call me a sappy romantic, but this movie just touched my heart, not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time. even though it made me cry,i admit, at the end, the whole movie just brightened up my outlook on life thereafter.i suggested to my horror, action, and pure humor movie buff of a brother,who absolutely adored this movie. this is a movie with a good sense of feeling.it could make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love,and enjoy your life.every time you purposefully walk past this movie, just be aware that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie.who knows? what if it could really happen to you?, and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.
