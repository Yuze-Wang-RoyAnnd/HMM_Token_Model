the tighter the drama, the better the film of sister rivalry! this little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy upon its release in sweden, so i'm glad to find that wasn't the whole case. funny bits on small-town bickering are there to enjoy, surely, but the drama takes center stage, as the story progresses. and not just family drama, it also raises poignant questions on respecting differences of peoples' lifestyle choices.<br /><br />great character ensemble with many superb and moving dramatic scenes that score credibility points; and they're not just scattershot, but hold everything in place. it just makes me assume that if ingmar bergman had made this (the drama would suit him!), the international attention probably would have been immediate.<br /><br />7 out of 10 from ozjeppe.
