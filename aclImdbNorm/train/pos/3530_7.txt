i can safely admit (as an imdb geek) that 'phantom lady' will never crack into my film noir top twenty. it may not even sneak into the top fifty. but rather than discredit the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film noir genre, it should be noted that 'phantom lady' has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a worthwhile viewing. all that is required from the viewer is the ability to get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning.<br /><br />the film doesn't get cooking until 'kansas' (ella raines) sets about trying to prove all but single handedly the innocence of her boss, scott anderson (alan curtis), who has been convicted of murder. 'kansas' is anderson's secretary by day and amateur detective by night. as the novice sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets of new york at night. little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together. to be honest, the film belongs to raines and it is only due to her presence that the film works well at all. somehow she is able to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not interesting in the slightest. i'm not sure if this splintered dynamic of a characterless leading man becomes the fault of the actor or the director, but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film.<br /><br />as interesting as raines is as a novice detective, things really accelerate into another hidden gear when 'kansas' pays a late night visit to a wandering drummer (elisha cook, jr.) in search of some information to help her condemned boss. she and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the "all night" jazz clubs. trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene or worse yet, it could ruin the scene all together. you'll know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished ringing out. if you're lucky enough to have this film on dvd, you'll more than likely be rewinding this scene again and again. as good as raines is, it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy. it is mainly because of this scene that i rate 'phantom lady' a 7 instead of a 6.<br /><br />for the most part this film comes off as tepid and bland with a few great scenes and one magnificent scene. it is the 'drum/sex scene' that separates this film from any others of the same ilk.<br /><br />and just like it is said in the film that "you never go wrong with vanilla", i would also like to add that "going with vanilla" is the safe fall back choice when one can't decide on having a tastier treat.<br /><br />7/10. clark richards
