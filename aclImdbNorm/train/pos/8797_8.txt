a great idea: 11 stories about 11 september. 11 directors from different countries with different results. ken loach talking about an immigrant (as usual) is just brilliant (as usual). the frenchman does a very good job also, while the burkina faso film was a nice surprise. however, the israel film was a bit boring, and the mexican guy, well, he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant. 8/10
