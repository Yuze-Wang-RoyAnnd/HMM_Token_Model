this unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a pow escape during ww ii. the performances are incredible, especially anthony steele. the movie works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual, and literal. the dialogue is ingenious and rings very true. in fact, an unusual all-around authenticity puts this one head-and-shoulders above most war epics.
