men of honor features cuba gooding jr., in what is probably his best performance to date. he plays carl brashear, a man of towering courage and heroism. he's a poor dirt farmer from the south, who wants to become a navy diver- but has problems because of his race. the head of the diving school, played by robert deniro, is a racist redneck that nonetheless grows to respect brashear. the film is about how brashear has to concur the nearly insurmountable odds, not once but twice. the performances are what make this film special. gooding is great, and deniro, the best actor in movie history, gives a towering performance- his best dramatic work in years. charlize theron gives another solid performance as deniro's much younger wife. the film lays on the patriotism a little too strong (though no where near the level it was in the patriot), and a few of the characters are just one dimensionally bad (hal holbrook's mr. pappy is just so evil), but the film is a rarity among films today. it's uplifting and uncynical. a wonderful film.
