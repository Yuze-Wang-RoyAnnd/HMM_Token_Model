i have had the pleasure of reading martin torgoff's book "can't find my way home" which is chock full of info on the drug culture of america, spanning the years 1945-2000. this guy knows his stuff!! i found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. i particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. the soundtrack was excellent. whoever compiled it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era. hopefully they will package them and sell them as a cd set. i would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with lsd forever changed american culture as we know it. one thing that was missing was any mention of george jung (played by johnny depp in the movie "blow"), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's.
