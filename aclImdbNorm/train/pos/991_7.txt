i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie. this movie was not intended to be a "deep thought" movie, which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be. in fact, it would appear that if any movie doesn't produce a life altering insight, and a deep, twisted, mind boggling plot, they would rate it a 1 or 2. don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people.<br /><br />this movie was an action/comedy flick, and that's all it was intended to be. and for an action/comedy, it was very well done. i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did, having never really been a jamie foxx fan, and having the over-used plot that it has.<br /><br />the plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (see blue streak, hudson hawk, 48 hours, etc. etc. etc.) but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist. now the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the real "bad guy" is an uber-geek.<br /><br />jamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film.<br /><br />if you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in "the matrix" or a drama such as "of mice and men" then this movie isn't for you. but if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast-paced filming, and an occasional twist of humor tossed in, this movie won't disappoint you. i would normally have rated it about an 8 (on the same level as the die hard trilogy), but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be.<br /><br />
