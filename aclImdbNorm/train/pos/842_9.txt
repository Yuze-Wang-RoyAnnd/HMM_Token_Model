the matador is a witty, dark humored and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from pierce brosnan, who has never ever been better than here, and the always reliable greg kinnear who has his best role here since playing jack nicholson's gay neighbor in as good as it gets. a big plus goes to the writing as well. clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way. the story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it's gonna go next.<br /><br />nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music, clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you don't quite know how to label the film. but that's also thanks to a very well written script which keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the edge of his seat.
