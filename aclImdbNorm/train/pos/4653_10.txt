this is a rip-roaring british comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired. peter ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception, particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan. karl malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in 'streets of san francisco'. i believe that maggie smith is the real star of this film though, appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on, particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes. one thing does concern me though, could someone please tell me why i cannot purchase this on either dvd or vhs format in the uk, could someone please assist?
