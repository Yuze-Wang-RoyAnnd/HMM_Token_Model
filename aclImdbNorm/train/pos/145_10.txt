sequel to "the kingdom" is bloodier and even more twisted. i only saw half (i was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1/2 hours) but i loved what i saw. ghosts, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated babies, voodoo...this has it all! if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you.<br /><br />also, you don't have to see part 1 to understand this...you'll figure it out!<br /><br />does anyone know if kingdom 1 and 2 are available on dvd? sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring. <br /><br />sadly, there probably won't be a "kingdom 3"--ernst-hugo jaregard (sig) died a year after this was filmed. but you never know!
