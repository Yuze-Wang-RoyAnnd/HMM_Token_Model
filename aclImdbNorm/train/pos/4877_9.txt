actually one particular person/character isn't "right there", but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie. and this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves and/or big production sets, but with a great story and very (believable) and good actors conveying the story (arc).<br /><br />you could call it a companion piece to great japan movies/cinema (such as tokyo story etc.), not so much story-wise of course, but more mood-wise! great acting, nuances in the performances that are truly gems. if you're eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally, than this is the one to go. as you have noticed (as with many of my reviews), i'm not getting into the story. there are places here at imdb where you can look those up, i'm not one to spoiler the story whatsoever!
