i'm amazed we see even one nay-sayer criticizing this old film. we don't ordinarily get good opera films, and here is a true grand opera rendition. understandably, the visuals are not great. it's dated. but as opera it can't be faulted; and i'm an opera buff. i can't even detect one lip-sync; if we didn't know that was tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it isn't sophia loren. she does everything with flair! her dark makeup is fine; and she brought the role to gorgeous life! the rest of the cast is wonderful, as is that stunning ballet troupe. most of the actors are excellent; loren truly marvelous. her rival amneris is also terrific. whoever didn't care for this 1953 job is shamefully remiss. verdi would have enjoyed it! naturally, renata tebaldi as aida is the engine behind the scenes. i love this old movie!
