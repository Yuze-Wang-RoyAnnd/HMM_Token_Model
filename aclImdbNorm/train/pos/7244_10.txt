this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge. i found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that, the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living. <br /><br />some of the scenes are very funny. i don't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. <br /><br />some of the dresses are really beautiful, pity the movie is in black and white - i can only imagine what they would look like in colour. the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious. there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that. <br /><br />watch it as soon as you can, and tell your friends about it.
