the acting- fantastic. the story- amazing. the script- wonderful.<br /><br />just a few ways to describe this movie. yes, it's slow and it has mostly talking, but the whole story of all of their lives and how it's told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story. i, myself, am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie. i'm also to read the exectioner's song, which is the 'other' half of the gilmore story. this movie made me think so much about the phrase "piering into the other side of the looking glass". you hear a song in the movie called gary gilmore's eyes, which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it'd be like to have gary gilmore's eyes(which is one of the things gary gave as a transplant when he died) and as you listen to it, which is after the last time mikal ever sees gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself. this movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others. i recommend this movie(and the book) very very much.
