this is a great example of a rather simple film noir story that is handled exceptionally well--thanks to excellent direction by otto preminger as well as some lovely acting performances. dana andrews stars as a hot-headed detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains. soon after the film begins, andrews is being reprimanded for this and is warned that if this continues he'll be off the force. a bit later, while investigating a crime he's attacked by a suspect and andrews is forced to fight to protect himself. this time he does not use excessive force but the assailant is killed. andrews panics and assumes they won't believe him so he tries to cover up the death--though instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime.<br /><br />there's a lot more to the film than this--including a plot involving a slimy villain (gary merrill) and a love interest for andrews (gene tierney). all in all, this is one of the better examples of the genre--with great gritty dialog, superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story. this is the way noir was meant to be.
