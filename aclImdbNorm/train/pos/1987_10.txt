that movie was awesome! i can't get over it's songs. i think i'm a little too old for musicals, but that movie deserves some credit here, guys! my especial favorite was jack wild. me, being a british actor lover, you can't restrain me from all those nice-looking fresh faced, young men. i never knew that when jack was doing that movie he was sixteen! he looks like an eleven- year old. he's short, that's what helps. try posting up your replies, fellow posters, so i can relate to your experiences. oh, and about oliver reed, that guy, bill sikes, i think that drone look is really familiar. any idea where he's starred in before? if so, post it up, i'd really like to know.
