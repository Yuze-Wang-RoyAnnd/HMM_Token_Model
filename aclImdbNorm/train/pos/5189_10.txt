another woo's masterpiece!<br /><br />this is a best wuxie film i'm ever seen! woo - rulez forever (except some hollywood moments...). john woo - greater director of the century.<br /><br />maybe hi is not more intellectual than lot of big directors... but he is lyrical and spiritual idol of all free-mind people! <br /><br />his movies like the great poetry! woo is a movie sheakspeare! woo is a movie biron! woo is a mozart of bloodshet!!!!<br /><br />imho violent in woo films is not a directors bloodlust, but a instrument of art. themes of woo movies is more humanistic that more of the new films.
