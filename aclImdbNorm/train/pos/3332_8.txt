yes, commitment. let's say "fever pitch" might trick you into believing it's a baseball movie.<br /><br />but no, you don't have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the farrelly brothers. but of course, if you are one, you will enjoy it even more; with all the references (pretty accurate ones, i'd say) to the boston red sox and its bittersweet history; from the curse of the bambino and everything attributed to it, including those two words you cannot pronounce in front of a boston fan: bill buckner.<br /><br />drew barrymore and jimmy fallon portray two people who, usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship: the successful workaholic who is also affluent meeting a school teacher? thing is, fallon's character wins barrymore's heart by being funny, caring, sweet and downright perfect. but her friends ask her a logical question: if he's such a keeper, why is he still on the market? enter the boston red sox. he's been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his sox season tickets to him; he has never missed a red sox home game at fenway park in a long while.<br /><br />and that delicate balance, how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his guy's obsession; and how much is that baseball-crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the other love of his life, is what this movie is all about.<br /><br />at first, you might think that the sports-obsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief. well, i'm sad to admit, they are not. myself, as a die-hard houston astros fan, can say they are all true. i would try at every way available to see every 'stros game; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet. i read the chronicle's sports section every day. and yes, my room looks like the shed, minute maid park's gift shop; with a closet full of astros gear, including 5 jerseys, 20 t-shirts and you know the rest. fallon's character even has the red sox mbna mastercard.<br /><br />fallon was credible enough as the fanatical red sox faithful, even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon (thank god adam sandler wasn't in it); and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage with each other's passions.<br /><br />i'd say it'll be a classical romantic comedy. not enough to be among the best movies in history; but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike.
