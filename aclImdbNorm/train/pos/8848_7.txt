i watched this film in a very strange way -- i had put it on my netflix list and couldn't remember why (other than that i knew philip seymour hoffman was in it). since the film has no opening credits, i couldn't even remember who had directed it.<br /><br />as my wife and i watched it, i turned to her about 45 minutes in and said, "you know, i keep wanting to decide that i hate this film, but something about it just won't let me stop watching it." then there's a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that are truly electrifying in the actors' performances.<br /><br />it was only as the end credits rolled that i realized it was a sidney lumet film. and i thought -- wow. i'm surprised that lumet took on what was really a dirty, petty little story about really mean, broken people. but it's a testament to his talent that i was so taken in when i didn't even realize it was him.<br /><br />philip seymour hoffman is really, really good in this movie. like scary good. put this up against capote and i would argue the oscar should have been for this film instead.<br /><br />i also highly recommend the narrative special feature with lumet, hawke and hoffman talking about making the movie -- it's entertaining and educational, with hawke playing the student eager to learn at the master's feet. lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors -- kiss their asses constantly!!<br /><br />there are a lot of violent, melodramatic movies out there that are empty ciphers when all is said and done. and there is an element of that in this film -- that the actors fill the air with sulphurous blasts of emotion, and when the smoke clears there's nothing left. nothing resonates on a deeper level.<br /><br />but lumet has given us network and twelve angry men -- films that, each in their own ways, have been elevated into the highest echelons of cinema.<br /><br />this movie isn't at that level. but there's something about it that lingers. and maybe that's enough.<br /><br />my final comment is about the comments -- if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on imdb -- and the depth and intelligence of the comments, pro and con -- it's a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this film.
