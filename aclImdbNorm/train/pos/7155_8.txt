more than just a "kids' movie", "holes" looks at how past incidents still affect us today, whether we know about them or not. when teenager stanley yelnats iii (shia leboeuf) gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day long, he discovers a number of things about the camp, and his personal connection to it. through flashbacks, we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (you'll understand this better when you see the movie). leboeuf does a pretty good job, as do the other cast members: sigourney weaver, jon voight, tim blake nelson, henry winkler, patricia arquette, and eartha kitt. a very interesting movie.
