to my surprise, i really enjoyed disney's latest animation installment. the film had its lows, but overall i felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. it was also pleasant to see an animated disney film that was not a musical. i was about pushed to the limits with tarzan. thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid.<br /><br />one disappointment was the animation. with all the great animated films happening outside disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little. there is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of atlantis! overall the film was entertaining, and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex.<br /><br />
