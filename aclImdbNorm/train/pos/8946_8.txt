this impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man, in a mortal world. her "community" is open among it's members, but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals. hmmmm...this is starting to sound familiar. lol. it's not your typical movie. very "campy" performances by jack lemmon and ernie kovacs keep things from getting dull. kim novak is always a pleasure on screen, but i found her pairing with james stewart unusual (but not fatal to the story).<br /><br />with re-newed interest in all things witchy and dark, this film deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by old and new audiences...... it's still a hoot !
