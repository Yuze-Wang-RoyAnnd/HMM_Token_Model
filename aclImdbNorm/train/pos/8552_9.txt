this is by far one of my favorite of the american pie spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character (one of the young stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature. <br /><br />for example ap: the naked mile. you have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks , and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity "problem" and he ends up stopping mid-deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend, who keep in mind gave him a "guilt free pass" for the weekend. i can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but let's be realistic; most people who are watching these movies aren't particularly searching for a romantic story.<br /><br />whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old erik stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always mr. levenstein lends his "perfectly natural" eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie.
