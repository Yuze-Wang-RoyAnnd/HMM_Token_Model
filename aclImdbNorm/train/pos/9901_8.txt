this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of them all, so when i saw it was free on demand, i had to watch it! it stars caroline munro, from both dr. phibes films (she was his wife that died!), dracula a.d. 1972, the golden voyage of sinbad, captain kronos - vampire hunter, the spy who loved me, maniac, and faceless.<br /><br />brought to you by the people behind don't open til christmas and pieces, heres my thoughts on this...<br /><br />it opens on april fools day, where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower, and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (all while hes naked!). the coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. but, the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive.<br /><br />cut to the future, and its th high school reunion, or so they think (bwahahha?). the only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid, and its april fools day (or really, the day before april fools, but the fun starts at midnight), yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall. then they finally break into the school and it starts storming.<br /><br />inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of their lockers and belongings, along with marty's (the nerds) locker and yearbook. they also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends his time saying "oooh yesser! yesser! i don't want no trouble, sir!" and then is killed instantly. pretty pointless character, but hes still my favorite.<br /><br />the movie takes a page out of alien's book, in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see! thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die, and they start freaking out, except for shirley, who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this. of course, it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off (very cool, mind you) the rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask.. whats their plan? "all we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon. marty wont kill us during mid-day!". seriously, thats what he said. apparently you can only kill at nighttime. but will they survive through the night? who will live and who will die? and why are all the bodies disappearing? rent, buy, or steal this great movie to find out! the movie is actually very good, filled with clich'es (car wont start, dammit!) and just plain slasher fun. not to mention they all have names like carol and nany and frank and joe and susan. i recommend it to all of you! and, not to mention, it has a spin off! 1989's cutting class is a spin-off from this slasher gem, and that movie starts the career of brad pitt and roddy mcdowell.<br /><br />favorite scene: 2 people having sex, the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn't. "talk dirty to me, frank!!" she screams "uh... tits!" "dirtier!" "uh... tits. f*ck. tits. boobs. f*ck.". it seems to work for her and at her climax, the killer electrocutes them both!
