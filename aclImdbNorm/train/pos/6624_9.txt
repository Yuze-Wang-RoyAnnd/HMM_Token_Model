i highly recommend this film. set in the bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 paris, it is in most respect a classic film noir script: lady in peril, sister trying to find her, honest cop fighting everyone. luckily, it avoids being stereotypical, and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting, innovative visuals. the film might remind you of sin city in look, but it has an even sharper, even more graphic novel look that i found really compelling. each frame, each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer. in terms of story and artwork, you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties (or even earlier with the classic views of the eiffel tower and sacre couer) and movies like casablanca, as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations. make any excuse you need to see this film.
