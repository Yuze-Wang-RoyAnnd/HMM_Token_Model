i don't think i could have enjoyed it more, though certain things were disturbing. i'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to find out for yourself. at any rate, what movie can lack with robert downey jr.'s puppy-dog eyes? all-in-all, the plot was developed sufficiently. nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. the characters were like-able, and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it. the idea over-all is that the story is very well tied together, even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory...by matter of opinion. but like i said before, it's hard not to love any movie with robert downey jr.
