back in my high school days in salina kansas, they filmed something called "the brave young men of weinberg" locally, and the film crews were rather prominent for weeks. eventually, we learned that the film was "up the academy", and was a bit ummm, "lower brow" than we had been led to believe. <br /><br />i had to see it, since i was there, and the local audiences seemed less than pleased at the showing. i was 17, and thought it was a rather artless attempt at a post "animal house" type of comedy, right down to the fart jokes. <br /><br />watched it many times since, and my opinion has mellowed a bit. it's dumb, but at times it catches a bit of the "mad" magazine humor, at least as well as most "mad tv". ron liebman might hate it, but he is nearly perfect, and unforgettable. for me, my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on santa fe avenue, where i had parked my car, while i was buying some guitar strings. too bad my pinto's brief appearance, usually seems to get cut for tv. haven't seen the new dvd, but if my old pinto is visible, they've got a sale.
