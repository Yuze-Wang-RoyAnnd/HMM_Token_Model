currently on metoo's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays, right after "maverick" and right before "wild, wild west" (followed by "star trek").<br /><br />don't know if i ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on, but i'm really captivated by it. offbeat, unusual, surreal stories set in a mythical west. kind of the "naked city" of westerns.<br /><br />and the guest stars are there: dan duryea, lyle bettger, brian donlevy, macdonald carey, rick jason (as a treacherous mexican), a young dick van patten, jack lord, noah berry, jr. (as a colorful mexican), martha hyer, marguerite chapman, even ann robinson ("war of the worlds"), gloria talbott ("i married a monster from outer space")<br /><br />it ran for eight seasons, over 200 episodes, from january, 1959, to december, 1965.<br /><br />eric fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss gil favor, the most stolid man that's ever lived, with the code of honor of a samurai, and just the right balance between toughness and open-handedness. i would vote for him for president any day. (p.s. he had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/ )<br /><br />and a young clint eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand, "rowdy" yates. also, veteran western actor and country music figure (the immortal "one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater") sheb wooley is there as seasoned scout pete nolan. and paul brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as "wishbone".<br /><br />and then there's that great theme song, performed by the immortal frankie laine. (between that and the "maverick" theme, i've got western theme songs running through my head all day.)<br /><br />i look forward to every episode; i'm collecting the whole set. a good time (not to mention a moo-ving experience) is always guaranteed, as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial.<br /><br />"rollin', rollin', rollin' . . .
