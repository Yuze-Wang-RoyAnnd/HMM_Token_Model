i was lucky to see "oliver!" in 1968 on a big cinema screen in boston when i was a young teenager. later, during the summer of 1969, i was pleased to see this film was still playing at a prominent cinema in leicester square, london, after it had won the academy award for best picture of the previous year.<br /><br />th success of "oliver!" on both the stage and screen reminded me that not all talent begins on broadway and ends in hollywood. this legendary story by charles dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all english-speaking people, was admirably brought to the london stage by lionel bart of great britain. his charming musical then became a hit in new york and throughout the world. the film adaptation was made in england during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. the sets and musical numbers are mind boggling. the song "who will buy?" required hundreds of actors and the british film director truly deserved his oscar for putting it all together in a seamless manner. some canadian and american talent is also part of this wonderful production, but mostly it is a tribute to the fine craftsmanship of the british film studios, such as shepperton. good show! other film studios at elstree, boreham wood, bray, denham, and ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years.
