life stinks (1991) was a step below mel brooks other productions. he stars as a rich man who wages an insane wager with his "friends". brooks claims that he can life like a homeless man for a month. his shocked and amused friends accept this unusual wager. during his "stay" in the bowery, he meets a bunch of odd homeless people, one of them catches his fancy (lesley-ann warren). they strike up a friendship as she teaches him the many tricks she learned whilst living on the street. can mr. brooks survive on his own without the luxuries of being filthy rich? will he win this unorthodox wager? who are his true friends? find out when you watch life stinks to find out!<br /><br />this film has been slagged unfairly. sure it's not a classic like his earlier films but it's still enjoyable. i liked the way mel brooks pays homage to charles chaplin in this film. if you have watched chaplin's earlier silent films then you'll get the humor as well.<br /><br />recommended for mel brooks fans.
