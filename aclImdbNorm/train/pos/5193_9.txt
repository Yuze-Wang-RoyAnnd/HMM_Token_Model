the sword fighting was out of this world, the fights scenes spectacular without the flying on a wire techniques (until the end) that are way too common today. the scene with chan and pray was probably the highlight of the movie. the characters in the assault on the bad guys mansion were clich'e but the movie is comfortable with it. an injection of humour from woo.<br /><br />the plot with it's twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you couldn't tell who was good or bad or which side people were on. <br /><br />a good sense of suspense and well timed surprises. the depth of the story is quite intense for a flighty film of this genre and reaches you in ways most kung-fu flicks don't.
