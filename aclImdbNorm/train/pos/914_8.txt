vivah is by no means a classic. however in the days of hardcore action, path-breaking special effects & complex plots (none of which bollywood has mastered yet), its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah. the story as we all know is a journey from a couple's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times. nothing more, nothing less. the music isn't quite in the same league as mpk or hahk but doesn't jar your senses either. two songs stood out for me - mujhe haq hai & do anjaane. while milan abhi aadha & hamaari shaadi were hummable. shahid performs sincerely & shows a lot of potential. its good to see him play something else but the "cool dude" he normally does. amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile small-town girl to perfection. alok nath, anupam kher & seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job. suraj's direction is simple but effective. the movie's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers. but all in all a good, clean, decent family movie.
