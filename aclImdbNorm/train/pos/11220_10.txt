aim for the top! gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it. i totally loved this series, and to this day, it remains my favorite anime. and while it was not gainax's first animated product, it was their first ova series.<br /><br />mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970's sports drama aim for the ace (ace o nerae!), gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2, when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with. it is because of her father's death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot. but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. her friend, kazumi amano, even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot. however, noriko's coach, koichiro ota, has faith in her. and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for he was a survivor of the battle in which noriko's father was killed.<br /><br />other characters include jung-freud, a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to, smith toren, a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and kimiko higuchi, noriko's childhood friend. kimiko's involvement is also of interest, as while noriko is off in space, kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life. and because of the acts of time dilation, kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school. by the end of the series, noriko is roughly 18 years old while kimiko is in her mid-fifties.<br /><br />all in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation. if you like hideaki anno's other shows, or are a fan of haruhiko mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. it will grow on you.
