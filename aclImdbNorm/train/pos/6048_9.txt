what a class bit of british cinema! it's about time. and a side splitting comedy to boot!<br /><br />anyone searching to relive a bit of freedom from their misspent youth this road movie will prove the ticket.<br /><br />it's a mix between "withnail and i" and "easy rider". the movie runs at a solid pace and doesn't let you drift off for too long... at times there are reflective moments, but i think they are well justified and add to the characters the actors are portraying. i was a little concerned with phil daniels character at the start but thankfully was won over half way through in what was one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie! generally i found myself belly laughing through the film most likely annoying some people around me. oh well.<br /><br />i would thoroughly recommend it. this will become a cult british comedy. well worth a visit.
