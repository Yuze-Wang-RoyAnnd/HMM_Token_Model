watched both parts twice. enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero. he was very believable as the hunter alan quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of richard chamberlain. i do admit that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the "lady in distress". alison doody should stick with modern and not period pieces. she didn't have the look of the woman of the 1800's. the rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well. i am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older. age is inevitable, but let's not hide from it. a man at 50+ can be much sexier (and , patrick truly is sexy) then a green youth, no matter how pretty. hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile.
