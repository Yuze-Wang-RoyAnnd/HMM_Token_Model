the entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very non-threatening and non-medical way that even preteen children can easily understand. it dispels many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days (1946) while sex is not explicitly mentioned, the part about fertilization is. this is also, purportedly, the first hollywood production to ever use the word "vagina" in the dialogue.<br /><br />it is cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day. many of the betty boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either. max fleischer was a bit of a card and did this with many of the betty boop cartoons which required frame-by-frame viewing to find them.<br /><br />there is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is. in fact, there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning kotex and kimberly-clark corporation.<br /><br />this title is nearly impossible to attain; but for those who are bittorrent downloaders, it can be found out there in the ether. this is one of those "keepers" that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity.
