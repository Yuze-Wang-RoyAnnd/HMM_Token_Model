a classy film pulled in 2 directions. to its advantage it is directed by wes craven. on the downside the tv film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget. it moves along as susan lucci draws robert urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club. his latest invention, a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood. anyone seeing this should pay attention to susan lucci. her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later. the actor, scientist and parapsychologist stephen armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film. lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called catherine. lucci and barbara steele's portrait in 'black sunday' were used as references for the catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by armourae. probably due to a personal nature between the artist and catherine. so by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film.
