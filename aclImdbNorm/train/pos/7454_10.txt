** warning - this post may contain spoilers **<br /><br />i only got a gamecube in september 2005, and the first two games i bought were james bond games, the decent agent under fire and the dull goldeneye rogue agent. the next game i planned to get was everything or nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games i already had. i have to say, he was right. <br /><br />i bought this for a tenner in hmv, and when i got home, i slammed it in to my cube and played it for hours on end. it was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline. graphics were some of the best i have seen (but now that the xbox 360 has come out, farcry instincts predator has some of the best graphics known to man). the storyline was clever; mad man (willem dafoe, named as nikolai diavolo) and beautiful henchwoman (heidi klum, named as katya nadanova), try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots, which at the start of the game, you, james bond, have to destroy on a train. the bad thing is that one of them is hidden in katya's boobs. you then have to thwart their plans and save the world.<br /><br />the great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters, such as cleese voicing q. there are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky.<br /><br />gameplay - 10/10 graphics - 9/10 sound - 9/10 replay value - 7/10 multiplayer - 8/10<br /><br />i give this game a grand total of 90%
