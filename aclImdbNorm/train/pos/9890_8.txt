unfortunately, this movie never made it to dvd. i saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983, and then again when the vhs was released in 1992. when i recently saw a vhs copy at a flea market, i immediately bought it. i was not disappointed. first, the obvious: claudia ohana is beautiful and a joy to behold. but then, the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values and decide what is really important to you. the movie is about a lot of things. it is about how the world bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt that they can never repay. it is about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards, mortgage, and car payment. it is about trying to save an innocence that maybe we have never really had and maybe we cannot really save. it is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other. it raises a lot of questions but does not give answers. i think sometimes this is good. for this reason, this is a film really worth saving and seeing.
