i picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics' quotes on the back of the box. i'm not big into foreign films, and didn't know what to expect. i don't really care for subtitles either. but i absolutely loved it! it has a simple, lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life. i found myself laughing out loud repeatedly. i'd recommend this picture to anyone, even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles. this one makes it worth the effort.
