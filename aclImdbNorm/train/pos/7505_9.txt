if there's one genre that i've never been a fan of, it's the biopic. always misleading, filled with false information, over-dramatized scenes, and trickery all around, biopics are almost never done right. even in the hands of the truly talented directors like martin scorsese (the aviator) and ron howard (a beautiful mind), they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the notorious bettie page was no different. some critics and moviegoers objected to gretchen mol given the role of bettie page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part. i never doubted mol could handle the part since, but i never expected to as blown as away by her performance as i was upon just viewing the film hours ago. mol delivers a knockout oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pin-up girl, who, after an early life of abuse (depicted subtlety and tastefully done, something few directors would probably do) inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time. the picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story. director/co-writer marry harron and guinevere turner's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending. still, credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully. come oscar time, mol, turner, and harron should be receiving nominations. doubt it will happen, though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them. 9/10
