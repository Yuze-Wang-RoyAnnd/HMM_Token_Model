unlike tinseltown's version of hello, dolly!, jay presson allen's screen adaptation of ira levin's hit broadway thriller couldn't wait for it's stage incarnation to shutter before putting it up on the silver screen, so producers wisely decided to make the most of it's lengthy white way run! the film's opening and closing scenes are shot inside new york's intimate music box theater where deathtrap played for nearly five years. even the film's final fadeout on the theatre marquee is a version of the stageplay's famous logo. (although marketeers decided to go with a more fun rubik's cube icon for the movie.)<br /><br />now on a low-priced dvd release, deathtrap seems just as fresh and inventinve as ever. the cast is just right (better than their stage counterparts) and location scouts should be applauded for finding a suitably spooky house for our "one room, two act thriller" to take place in. opened up in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, director sidney lumet wisely tags any "new" material onto the beginning and end of the film and leaves levin's wickedly twisty center alone.<br /><br />the film's last scene is a major hollywood departure from the boards, and slightly undermines one of levin's plot points from earlier in the film [helga (about a dagger): "will be used by another woman because of play."]. like robert altman's the player, however, our new finale helps the film fold in on itself once again and blurs the lines between stage, screen, and (could it be?) real life!
