i love this movie, but can't get what is in this movie tht is not to like. people who don't like this movie must be richard roeper and roger ebert. but i can't believe that is mr. carrey behind all that makeup. and i am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this. and there is a new face in the movie. taylor momsen who plays cindy lou who. as the opens, the grinch (jim carrey) comes out of hiding. and causes some mean fun to the whos in whoville. sicne we know that the whos love christmas. while the grinch does not like christmas. and even makes fun of little cindy lou who (taylor momsen) who is the daughter of the town's postmaster (bill irwin). the movie was directed by ron howard. and the narrtor's voice is done by anthony hopkins. and jeffrey tambor (muppets from space) is cast as the mayor of whoville. who doesn't like talking about the grinch close to christmas time.
