i've watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! i haven't been this interested in an anime series since neon genesis evangelion. this series is actually based off an h-game, which i'm not sure if it's been done before or not, i haven't played the game, but from what i've heard it follows it very well.<br /><br />i give this series a 10/10. it has a great story, interesting characters, and some of the best animation i've seen. it also has some great japanese music in it too!<br /><br />if you haven't seen this series yet, check it out. you can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there, it's straight out of japan.
