i have to say that grand canyon is one of the most affecting films i've ever seen. i've watched it several times now and i still feel as i did the first time; that this film, by itself, could make up the entire curriculum of a post-graduate course in film direction. <br /><br />a long time ago film trailers used to promise, "it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry." that's a very trite and shorthand method of describing what grand canyon does. it takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell. <br /><br />much of the film is paced to cycle back and forth between people being close to happiness and the same people being close to horror. it's always a short step, too. just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is directorial genius.<br /><br />spoiler (of sorts) coming up. after getting the audience used to rocking back and forth through the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve with a sequence that doesn't go from good to bad and back but instead escalates from an ordinary marital spat, through an accidental self-inflicted knife wound that may or may not require stitches, to an earthquake that has the characters run from the house. in the moment of their relief, argument forgotten, cut finger forgotten, the earthquake survived, a neighbor woman calls out that her elderly husband has collapsed. the couple rushes to his aid. i cried when i saw this sequence. i cried every time i saw it. i'm crying now. it isn't sadness that does this to me. it's not a particularly sad sequence. what tears me up is that this few minutes of film was perfect. that's perfect! astounding. (end of spoiler)<br /><br />there's so much to say about grand canyon. it portrays relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies and it lets the viewer experience them vicariously. they aren't showy or overblown and there's no long pause to examine the moment carefully. the film moves on at the pace of life. even when the characters do try to make sense of what has happened, they are uncertain of what to derive from their experience. <br /><br />grand canyon is a very human film.
