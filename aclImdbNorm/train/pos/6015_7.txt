in the early 1970s, many of us who had embraced hippy/acid/alternative culture wholeheartedly, had realised that mainstream society was not going to change in the way we thought it would. for me this film defined the tension of "now what?" that many of the people i knew felt at that time. do we head for the commune and create our own vision of utopia or do we radicalize and push for change?<br /><br />from the futile gestures to police, the radical rhetoric, the music of pink floyd, to the love-making and the explosive images in the desert - so much is in there. it captures well a significant moment in time.
