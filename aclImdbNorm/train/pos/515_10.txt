i remember the first time i saw this movie -- i was in the office working over the weekend & the tv was on for background noise. but i gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie i'd never seen or heard of, until i was completely absorbed. a matter of life & death (the british title -- stairway to heaven in the us) is delightful, compelling, whimsical, & moving, all in one superbly-written, well-acted, perfectly-directed package. it's a classic that really does rank right up there with casablanca, it's a wonderful life, gone with the wind, citizen kane, & chariots of fire. why has it never received the same public notice & video-store prominence? fortunately, some knowledgeable critics have put it on their "top 100 of all time" lists. there is hope -- 1940's fantasia wasn't a hit 'til the '60s, & the wizard of oz was a dud at the box office, but made a hit by tv. buy it -- rent it -- watch it -- demand it! you won't be disappointed!
