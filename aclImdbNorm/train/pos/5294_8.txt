"pecker" proves that waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age. a lot of things have changed since waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do. over the years, the budget of waters' films has increased considerably. this is one of his most recent productions, but i was amazed to see that waters still has that "trailer-park" touch. edward furlong plays pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. he lives a quite life in baltimore, md, with his friends and family. but pecker attracts the attention of a new york art agent (the always watchable lili taylor), and his life changes for the worst. once again, waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. it is not among his best films, but there are some big belly laughs here ("memama" has the best lines in the film!). it is consistently clever and funny, and has that very "queer" sensibility that i have come to love in warters' movies.
