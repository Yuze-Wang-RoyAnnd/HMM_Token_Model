this movie was hysterical. i haven't laughed this hard in a long time. i mean, it's not "good will hunting," but was it supposed to be? i actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised. the comedy hits hard and is fairly constant. amanda peet is hot and awesome. the entire audience that i screened it with seemed to be enjoying the film as much as i did.
