i just saw this film last night at toronto film festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section. to tell you the truth, the only reason why i went for this movie was because it shared its name with the radiohead song, and also because my friend had bought the tickets so i really didn't have a choice :-d i went in expecting it to be something like the silence of the lambs, but it turned out to be semi-gore flick. somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable, and that is absolutely correct. i really couldn't care less if potente's character got her entrails ripped out by the creep. i was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with potente's character getting her just desserts. christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film. however, the story is rather weak, but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively. the score by a bristol band called the insects was top notch. that, more than anything else, really scared the crap out of me.<br /><br />the director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the q&a session. i really do hope he gets to make better films in the future.<br /><br />this one is strictly for genre fans, but i'd recommend non-fans to give this a try anyway. it was a fun ride.
