i think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it's worst moments. there is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud. jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and julia stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself. apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end. (which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). anyway, better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick...cheers
