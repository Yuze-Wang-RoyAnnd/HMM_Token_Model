six degrees had me hooked. i looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when men in trees replaced it's time spot. i thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007. what happened? all my friends were really surprised it ended. we could relate to the characters who had real problems. we talked about each episode and had our favorite characters. there wasn't anybody on the show i didn't like and felt the acting was superb. i alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas. i for one would like to protest the canceling of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. give it a good time slot, don't keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it so people will know it is on.
