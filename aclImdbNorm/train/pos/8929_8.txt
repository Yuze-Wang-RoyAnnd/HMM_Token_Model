first of all, i liked very much the central idea of locating the '' intruders'', others in the fragile self, on various levels - mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical. in fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film : in the swiss-french border where the pretagonist leads secluded life; in the his recurring daydream and nightmare; inside his ailing body after heart transplantation.... in the last half of the film, he becomes intruder himself, returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past. <br /><br />the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic, full of regrets and guilts, sense of failure being more or less dominant. this is a quite grim picture of an old age, ostensibly self-dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside. the directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings. some of them are mesmerizing, not devoid of humor though, kind of absurdist play only somnambulist can visualize.
