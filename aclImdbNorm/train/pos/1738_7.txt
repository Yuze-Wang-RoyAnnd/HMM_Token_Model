this is a hilarious film. burt reynolds is a nascar star who signs a sponsorship contract with ned beatty's chicken pit restaurants. the contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it, such as forcing burt to wear a chicken suit during the race! jim nabors is his (not quite convincing) chief mechanic. loni anderson (oh, yeah!) is assigned by beatty to keep reynolds honest and strictly adhering to the contract. this is a funny film in which burt proves that he ain't too proud. i like it!
