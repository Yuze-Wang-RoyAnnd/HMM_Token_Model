the lady from shanghai is proof that the great genius orson welles could direct a "mainstream" movie if he wanted to. by comparison to his other, more artistic works, this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness, and almost no esoteric elements.<br /><br />the exception being, of course, the final scene in the hall of mirrors, widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film. it alone is worth the cost of a rental.<br /><br />the sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful rita hayworth. her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent, she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters. even the great mr. welles.
