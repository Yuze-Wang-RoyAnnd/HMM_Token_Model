'moonstruck' is a love story. there is not one romance, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. loretta's family. loretta (cher) is about to marry johnny cammareri (danny aiello). she doesn't love him, but he is sweet and good man. when he leaves to visit his dying mother in italy loretta meets johnny's brother ronny (nicolas cage). he and johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. of course they fall instantly for each other.<br /><br />how this story and love stories of loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself. every seen is a delight to watch, with cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. she won and really deserved the oscar that year. cage is pretty good, and goofy as well, and olympia dukakis as loretta's mother and vincent gardenia as her father are terrific. this movie is funny, charming and therefore highly enjoyable.
