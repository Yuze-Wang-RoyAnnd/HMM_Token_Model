i have personally seen many disney movies in my lifetime, though absolutely none of them match up in any way to bedknobs and broomsticks. although i personally wouldn't have crossed live-action with animation, it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters. the movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country. i would have to say that the casting was brilliant. angela landsbury made a perfect miss price, while david thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest. endings always surprise me and this was no exception. it was neither happy nor sad, though i do not know if this was intentional. the dialog wasn't great, but considering it was designed to be a kid's movie, that is alright. overall, i would give the performance nine out of ten, the dialog six out of ten, the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten.
