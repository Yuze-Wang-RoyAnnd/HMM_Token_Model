i don't see how this show is like the oc at all. <br /><br />first of all, the oc centers around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life. north shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time. second, the oc takes place in california. north shore takes place in hawaii.<br /><br />and why would fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network? i think this is a great show with good actors for the most part. it has a good storyline and plot. i like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out. the most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out. it wasn't predictable like most stories on most shows. <br /><br />i hope fox keeps it on the air.
