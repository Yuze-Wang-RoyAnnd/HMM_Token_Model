i was deeply moved by this movie in many respects. first of all, i just want to say that clara lago was the most precious little thing! such a pretty little girl. her acting was superb as well. true to life and very human. though i don't like the part where she had to smoke; i hope it was only a fake prop. either way, she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving. i found myself immersed in the story and her character.<br /><br />it's quite interesting how i came to discover this movie actually. i was walking in blockbuster and i just happened to notice her pretty smile on the cover as i was walking by. luckily i glanced in the downward direction that this movie was in! i thought to myself, 'awe, look at her!' so i picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as "a little gem." i read the plot on the back and then thought that, well, maybe i'd look it up on imdb first and then come back and rent it at a later time. i'm glad i didn't, because i certainly would have been missing out. after searching for a movie with my friend, i knew that i would end up regretting not renting this film, so i went back to the spot in which i originally found it and snapped it up.<br /><br />it had been on my dresser for a week, since school started for me this week and i really hadn't any time to watch it, but tonight was the perfect opportunity. i popped it in and was glued to the beautiful cinematography, delightful score and moving plot from beginning to end. i was so captivated and must say, some parts nearly moved me to tears.<br /><br />i would also like to make a special mention for the young boy in this film, juan jose ballesta. he was remarkable. also the actor who played carol's father, who's name is unfortunately not listed on the site. his voice was just so loving and gentle that i could really sense his love for carol. even though his appearance is not prominent, i really felt his character's presence.<br /><br />this is truly a wonderful movie. if you are a person who is moved by light, but emotional films, then this is definitely one for you.
