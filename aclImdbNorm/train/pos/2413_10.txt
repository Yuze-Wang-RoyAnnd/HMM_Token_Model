love the tv show. was hooked first time i saw it. wish i was there acting in with them. it touches reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with, then at a turn of events that you meet someone else and that person is more of who you want to be with. you are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other. someone is going to get hurt, there's no stopping that. making the decision is hard but, do you want to go on being unhappy when you could have been. why go on and live a life that you thought that you wanted or thinking you are doing the right thing and you both be unhappy. that other person isn't going to wait a life time waiting, they have a life a well. making the decision that you really want will be better in the end. making the best of what you have is a good thing a well. money, cars, houses, etc....don't make you happy, having the one person that you really want to be with to share it with does.
