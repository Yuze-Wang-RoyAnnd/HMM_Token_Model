when i saw the dentist, i thought it was very cool. but this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like gory scenes as the dentist has lots of gory scenes. that's why it has it's r18 rating. it's about a beverly hills dentist dr alan feinstone, who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the poolman. it's best to go to your dentist "before" you watch this. but if you don't like going to the dentist already, then it's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life. the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that i've ever seen. who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (spoiler) pull out all his cheating wife's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic? overall awesome flick, but not for everyone.
