good for an evening's entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing. garrison's affair with the first lady was unreal and passionless; the president was a cardboard cut-out. and who were the real villains anyway? nothing was developed or explained sufficiently. i still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved. the villains were nameless and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plot. michael douglas and kiefer sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story - the chase and confrontation were good. but kim basinger and eva longoria were both unbelievable in their roles, basinger totally lacked character and no way could longoria have been a secret service agent. this could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way, with too many unanswered questions. disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes. and did they use the 'west wing' set for the white house scenes? - i kept expecting cj or charlie to appear!
