kurt russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action-thriller from paul anderson (event horizon, resident evil.) set on a garbage-dump planet, soldier plays like a cross between rambo and shane, with russell barely speaking as the title character, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for dead. the supporting cast of colonists, including connie nielsen, sean pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute michael chiklis, is able. they spend most of the movie being scared of russell, and the rest of it running for their lives. russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given. with almost no words to say, he conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and glances. it is almost a mime performance. when the action sequences kick into gear, he kicks ass--and does so in a strong, silent, matter-of fact way. there are flaws. jason scott lee is brutish as a "superior" genetic soldier. jason isaacs does a great impression of frank burns from m*a*s*h as a weaselly commanding officer, and gary busey busts a gut (and nearly busts his girdle) as todd's mentor. this is an underrated, and excellent sci-fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of blade runner--david webb peoples wrote both screenplays.
