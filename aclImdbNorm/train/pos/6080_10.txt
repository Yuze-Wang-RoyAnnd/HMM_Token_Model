othello, the classic shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. i remember studying this story in high school, actually i found othello to be probably my favorite shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was, the fact that shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism perfectly. i mean, when you really do study this story, you could go into so many philosophies on why othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye. but later on for my report i also watched this version of othello and i have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. lawerance and kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it's darkness.<br /><br />othello is the big time soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. but when the king finds out that othello snuck off with his daughter, desdemona, the king is infuriated, but excepts it. othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, cassio, his side man instead of iago, who has stood by othello. due to his insane jealousy, he's out for revenge. still pretending to be othello's best friend, he just mearly hints at othello that desdemona is cheating on him with cassio, never says that they are, just makes othello think that it's happening. othello is driven insane and doesn't have pleasant plans for desdemona or cassio and iago is more than happy to help him out.<br /><br />othello is an incredible story, i highly recommend that you read it. it's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. othello the movie is also great and once again i recommend it, it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel, or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between othello and desdemona, how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him. this is a terrific movie, great acting, good sets, and good direction, this is what shakespeare meant when he wrote the story.<br /><br />10/10
