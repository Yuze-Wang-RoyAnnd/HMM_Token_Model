i'll be honest. i got this movie so i could make fun of it. i mean, come on, "hood of the living dead"? what other reaction could i have? the thing is, though, the movie (and its makers) decided that it wasn't going to be made fun of. instead, it was going to try its best to be a good movie.<br /><br />and you know what? it came awfully close. a little less cheese in the incidental music, a little more professionalism in the photography, the acting, the incidentals (like the props--love the best buy bag)...well, it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty neat little movie on its own. and the acting, writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than i would have expected. there's even some decent humor, as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead.<br /><br />if you can overlook the low budget (which leaves its fingerprints in everything, alas) and the almost constant profanity, this can be a pretty fun time at the movies. no, it ain't great. yes, it could have been better. but the makers, the actors, the crew, they all tried to make a good film (instead of a camp classic) and that counts for a lot. the line of campy zombie films is a mile long, and thank you, guys, for not adding to it.<br /><br />kudos to the quiroz brothers. i'd love to see what they do next. and hey, somebody, give them a budget!
