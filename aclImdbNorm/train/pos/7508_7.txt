great acting on the part of gretchen mol. this film is one of the best biopics to hit the screen in some time. while it does cover the majority of bettie's young life, it also manages to stay on a mostly focused path which is something most biographical films seem to lack. there is some lovely and alarmingly funny subtext in the dialogue and acting. this film is an excellent break from the dir. of "american psycho," and i think this will show through as her best work to date. oh, and as a cinematography buff, i give this film 100% in the cine dept. it was amazing how well they pulled off a 50s look with modern film stocks. accolades to the d.o.p. all around very enjoyable. i recommend any interested to see it: 8/10.
