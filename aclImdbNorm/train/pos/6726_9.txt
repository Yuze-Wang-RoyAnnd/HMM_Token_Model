again stacy peralta is true first to the people who lived the story. by letting those involved in the genesis of big wave surfing tell us their stories, how it felt and what they thought, you get the feeling of having been there. the film carries you from the fifties to the near present by focusing on three primary architects contributing to the evolution and development of the sport. candid "home movie" like videos of themselves and their contemporaries take you further into their world. the layers of music, culture, technical information,a pure view of the participant's athleticism, and fabulous big wave images you get a full scope perspective of this aspect of surfing.<br /><br />thoroughly worth watching.
