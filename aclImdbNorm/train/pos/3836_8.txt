extremely interesting and intriguing movie. the similarities to david lynch (who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of franz kafka (the house keeper in this film is called mrs. grubach, as is the one in der prozess...) are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of belgium in africa. the exact content of the movie i can not clearly describe: this colonialism is an important part, as is the inability to cope with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are a central issue as well, and his quest for social contact and love. these are the symbolic themes i deduced from the movie, but in fact they're no more than impressions.<br /><br />but even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery (beautiful close ups of beatles, larvas and other nasty insects are alternated with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style). maybe you can say that i didn't quite 'get' the film, but i have been watching like hypnothised for 1.5 hour, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity.
