either or, i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie. i have re-visited it many times and it always holds up. a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it. norman jewison, a fellow canadian, takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious, as this one is. i have often wondered at the paucity of cher's acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on. i have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role, as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in "mask". i found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called "cinderella")but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. nicolas page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat. the brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, just like opera. all in all a very satisfying film not to everyone's taste by a long shot, i loved the ending, everyone brought together like a greek chorus, every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others, the camera pulling away down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.
