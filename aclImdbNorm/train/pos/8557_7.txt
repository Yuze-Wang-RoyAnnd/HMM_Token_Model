i have to hand it to the creative team behind these "american pie" movies. "direct to dvd" typically is synonymous with cheap, incompetent film-making. yet last year i was pleasantly surprised when i found myself thoroughly enjoying the dvd sequel "the naked mile". the filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy, yet funny little film. this year they offer up the followup, "beta house". this is the honest truth, "beta house" makes the first few "american pie" movies look like "the little mermaid".<br /><br />this is no holds barred, tasteless, laugh-out loud fun. sure, the story is a bit thin, but that's the beauty of the whole thing. within the first 10 minutes we're introduced to the all the main characters, the new supporting characters, get a handful of raunchy gags, meet the villains, and establish the general plot-line. with all that out of the way, the movie becomes a no-limits ride. the gags are a plenty, and they did not hold back in this one. i'm talking male semen, urine, dildos, chicks-with-dicks, sex with sheep, female orgazim sprays, and plenty more. not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobs or a sex scene.<br /><br />returning from "the naked mile" are john white, jake siegel, steve talley, and eugene levy (in a similar supporting role as the last few films). the entire cast does fine work. steve talley (dwight stifler), in particular, has a great energy and screen presence. i predict good things for him. the film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open. by far the biggest laugh of the film for me was "the deerhunter" parody. classic.<br /><br />the bottom line is, if you're a fan of the series, you'll feel right at home with "beta house". it really pushes the limits of good taste, but in the end is pretty damn funny.
