i saw this film without to know what about were... i'm a fan of branagh, even more his shakespeare' films, and, in the beginning, i saw it only for this... and i finished with tears in my eyes, because the great, great serenity, values, affect and brave philosophy about life of helena's girl. recommended to people who are bored with tv programming (in spain, at least).
