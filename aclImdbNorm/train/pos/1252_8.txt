the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me. this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and enraging. as an american, i am constantly humiliated by my country's behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement. we suck. this is probably the first john pilger documentary i've seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he's done. my only complaint, and the reason i gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inaction...but makes no suggestion of how to help. i don't know about britain, but america's made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government's doings. a gesture in the right direction might help these islanders' cause.
