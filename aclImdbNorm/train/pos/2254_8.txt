fox's epic telling of one a america's greatest pioneering efforts comes to dvd with some truly outstanding "extras". brigham young (the "frontiersman" was added for the european release), telling the story the great pioneer leader, who under inspiration brought members of the mormon faith (church of jesus christ of latter-day saints)out to the salt lake valley in 1847, after mobs murdered their prophet/leader, joseph smith (played by vincent price), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as america was about to enter world war ii. it was a daring move on fox chief, darryl f. zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air to the mormon people, as this was the first film attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen. now fox, working with james d'arc, curator of the excellent motion picture archives at brigham young university in provo, utah, has brought this film to the dvd format in an outstading edition. mr. d'arc, who some years ago did his doctoral dissertation on the film, has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a dvd. he seperates the fact from the fiction and lets listeners understand why this films was so much appreciated by church leaders even though embellishments to the truth run throughout the film. one of the fun bits of information deals with dean jagger, the actor who plays the title role. many years after the film he married a latter-saint woman and was eventually converted to the lds faith. there is much to be learned from d'arc's knowledge and it is great to have this as part of the dvd! there are over 100 pictures from the fox & byu archives included on the disc, plus newsreel footage of the incredible premiere at seven theatres in salt lake city. thanks fox for another outstanding dvd -- and thank you, james d'arc for your great commentary!
