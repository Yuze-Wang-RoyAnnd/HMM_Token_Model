i waited for this movie to come out for a while in canada, and when it finally did, i was very excited to see it. i really enjoyed it. of course, in the beginning, it is a very sad movie (and it was new years day - making it even sadder) - however, it sticks with you. the next day i was thinking about it again, because although it revolves around something so emotionally draining, you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story. how one person can be seen as the link to so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded so many things. and how diane keaton's character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there. and how they save her in the process as well. it was such an excellent movie, and chris pine (one of my favourite actors) provides the perfect comic relief. it is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues, but will really stay with you for a long time.
