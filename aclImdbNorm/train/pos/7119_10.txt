my father, dr. gordon warner (ret. major, us marine corps), was in guadalcanal and lost his leg to the japanese, and also received the navy cross. i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and i am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then, as i read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real-life. my father is a fanatic of facts and figures, and always wanted things to be seen as they were so i would like to believe he had something to do with that.<br /><br />he currently lives in okinawa, japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironically, she's japanese), and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back kendo and iaido to japan since mcarthur banned them after wwii.<br /><br />my father was once a marine but i know that once you are a marine, you're always a marine. and that is exactly what he is and i love and respect him very much.<br /><br />i would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it. and i'd love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!
