this is one of the first films i can remember, or maybe the first one. exactly the beautiful kind of film than introduce a kid, sweetly, into the world of violence and addictions were we live. a little bit of babe, casino and constantine, all this well mixed into a carton, and we get this. i don't know if its truly rated for kids, but i think it was very cool, very funny and interesting. i hate when a film (spescially a carton)can have a good end and its ruining because every character must have a happy end, even if it sounds weird (im not a bitter person).but this was ok, he simply goes heaven and they let it in that way.<br /><br />all this is just a critic, its a good movie an something new. very touching and i gotta go
