lorna green(janine reynaud)is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club. she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon. it's quite possible that, through a form of hypnotic suggestion, someone(..a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet)is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin. after the murders within her fantasies are committed, lorna awakens bewildered, often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality.<br /><br />if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco, i'd say it's elegant & difficult. by now, you've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about, since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream. franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career, as far as film-making style, and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience. and, as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision, others find the style labouring, dull, and bewildering. i'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even franco himself, when quizzed by critics who watched "succubus", admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it! some might say that "succubus" was merely a precursor to his more admired work, "venus in furs", considered his masterwork by franco-faithful, because it also adopts the surreal, dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined. in a sense, like the protagonist, we are experiencing the same type of confusion..certainly, "succubus" is unconventional film-making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on. and, a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters. "succubus" is also populated by beatnik types and "poet-speak", corman's film, "a bucket of blood" poked fun at. my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party..quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually. great locations and jazz score..i liked this film myself, although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction. loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna, a wee bit drunk, writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig(..equally wasted)rush her in an embrace of kisses.
