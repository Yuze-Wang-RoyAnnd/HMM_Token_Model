i didn't at all think of it this way, but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title "midnight cowboy" was a gay porno. at that point, all i had known of it was the reference made to it in that "seinfeld" episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and kramer's all sick and with a nosebleed.<br /><br />the movie was great, and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies i can't even remember because they're all crap.<br /><br />the plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy joe buck going to new york trying to be a hustler (a male prostitute, basically), thinking it'll be easy pickings, only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling him, charging him for their sexual encounter.<br /><br />then he meets enrico salvatore rizzo, called "ratso" by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time. you think of him as a scoundrel, but a lovable one (like han solo or lando calrissian) and surprisingly he and joe become friends, and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such. rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad, pitiable man who's very sick, and very depressed and self-conscious, hates being called "ratso" and wants to go to florida, where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved, and he'll learn to be a cook and be famous there.<br /><br />it's heartwarming watching joe do all that he does to get them both down to florida, along with many hilarious moments (like ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party, and getting caught by the woman who says "gee, well, you know, it's free. you don't have to steal it." and he says "well if it's free then i ain't stealin' it", and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi, and screams "hey, i'm walkin' here! i'm walkin' here!"), and the acting is so believable, you'd never believe joe buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor jon voight, and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman. it's not the first time they've worked together in lead roles, but the chemistry is so thick and intense.<br /><br />then there's the sad part that i believe is quite an overstatement to call it "depressing". ratso rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie, can barely walk, barely eat, coughs a lot, is sick, and reaches a head-point on the bus on its way to florida. he's hurting badly, and only miles away from miami, he finally dies on the bus. the bus driver reassures everyone that nothing's wrong, and continues on. sad, but not in the kind of way that'd make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you've just lost your dog of 13 years.<br /><br />all in all, great movie. and the soundtrack pretty much consists just of "everybody's talking'" played all throughout the movie at appropriate times. an odd move, but a great one, as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly. go see it, it's great, go buy it
