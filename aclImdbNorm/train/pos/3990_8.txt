may and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. the visit is awkward because the grandchildren and "kids" don't really seem to know each other as one might expect. the warmth that should be there is missing. after dinner, may's husband says he doesn't feel well, blames it on his daughter's cooking, and irritably says he wants to go home. he dies that night.<br /><br />may, now a widow, is lost. she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one, but she had a purpose. she had someone who needed her, and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years, she had something to do with her days.<br /><br />she is depressed and unmotivated. she goes to stay with her daughter, paula, who shortly after her mother's arrival, lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all. she lets loose with anger over her mother's lack of nurturing. may seems disarmed and surprised, yet she also doesn't seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right. "i'm your mother and i love you." what does really say? (i've heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means.) paula is a bit (well, more than a bit) neurotic. both women are needy, though they show it very differently.<br /><br />paula has been involved with a friend of her son's, darren, who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son. while paula is working during the day, may begins to have conversations and lunches with darren. darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son, nicky, but supposedly doesn't live in the home with his wife.<br /><br />may becomes attracted to darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have. darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life. (he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to "get away from it all," though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey. they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day, and may enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years, nor had ever expected to know again. as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren, this becomes part of may's rationalization that what she is doing is okay.<br /><br />at a writing group that paula leads, may is introduced, rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted. there is one scene where she has sex with the older man, who clearly can barely perform, and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on may's face as she endures the one-time ghastly liaison.<br /><br />eventually, paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother, that indeed her mother and darren have been having sex.<br /><br />this film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways. sympathies will be divided. at one point, during paula's writing group, may reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day, and would leave for pubs after they were asleep, making sure to get back home before her husband.<br /><br />clearly, a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub. may, however, also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn't like her having any friends, so she didn't have any. she did what he wanted her to do. she was miserable but she put up with it because, as she said, "it was easier." so, while may was not the best mother, for those inclined to have any sympathy for her, one might see may's actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for "a few minutes" in her lifetime. a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her, to know her as a human being, to have a friend and a lover.<br /><br />paula, though neurotic and unhappy, perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her. certainly, it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her mother.<br /><br />it is a well-done film, with more complexities than i have mentioned, and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many, perhaps conflicting, reactions. it is a film worth discussing and debating, and above all, worth seeing.<br /><br />one thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life. no matter who is deemed "right" or who is deemed 'wrong" by each viewer, that theme of old age and loneliness, evoking a sense of dread in most of us, is inescapable.
