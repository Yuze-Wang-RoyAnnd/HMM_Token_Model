the silent film the pride of the clan starring mary pickford was supposed to be set in a fictional island off the coast of scotland. in actuality, most of the exterior shots were filmed in marblehead massachusett on marblehead neck near several rocky seaside geographic areas including the churn and castle rock. my initial interest in the film was because of two factors: 1) the marblehead film location in my hometown and, 2) the fact that my grandmother lizzette m. woodfin was hired as a stand-in for mary pickford during filming of several scenes including the "cliff scene". both women were small (5') in stature and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was a stand-in with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the chiefton filming set. i just wanted to relate this story for future film historians and buffs. the film itself (my dvd copy is somewhat poor) is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting including several scenes where miss pickford portrays a strong woman characterization. i enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy of it although i am unsure whether one exists as i have seen in various movie sites that remaining copies are dark because of deterioration. a very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action!
