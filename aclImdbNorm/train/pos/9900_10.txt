it's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school. if you liked this movie, then i would suggest you watch valentine. i just found out today that the guy who played marty(simon) killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job. i wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie. it starts out when carol tricks him into going into the girls restroom to act like they were about to do it. when he was changing in the showers, carols popular friends snuck into the bathroom and got everything ready, camera, electric shock, pole. when marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked. he tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it, grab marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling. they picked him up, dunked his head in the toliet while it was being flushed, and they electricuted him(slightly). when the kids are in detention, given by the coach, 2 of the boys give marty a joint that will make him throw up. skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him. while marty is puking in the bathroom skip sneaks into the science lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was. the lab blows up disfiguring him badly. 5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got invitations for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it exploded. one by one the people get killed off. i don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could have gotten back up after marty left. she almost got out the first time.
