really enjoyed this little movie. it's a moving film about struggle, sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays miki is especially good). there's so many large scale impersonal films set around ww2, that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm, and an original one at that. i'll also add that this film is far from boring, very far!! of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. to anyone who really treats their animal as part of the family (i do), you'll find this film especially rewarding. recommended to movie fans who look for something a little different.
