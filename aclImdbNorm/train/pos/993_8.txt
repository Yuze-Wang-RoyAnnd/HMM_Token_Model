actually this movie was not so bad. it contains action, comedy and excitement. there are good actors in this film, for instance doug hutchison (percy from "the green mile"), who plays bristol. another well known actor is jamie kennedy, from "scream" and "three kings". the main characters are played by jamie foxx as alvin, who was pretty good and also funny, but the one who most surprised me, was david morse as edgar clenteen. he plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films like "the green mile", "indian runner", "the negotiator" or "the langoliers" he plays a very sympathetic person, and in "bait" the plays almost the opposite, a man without any emotions, which was nice to see. the only really negative thing about this film, are the several pictures of the world trade center, which makes this film perhaps look a little dated. overall i thought this was a pretty good little film!
