there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen.<br /><br />zorro's fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro films. first off, it's a republic serial in 12 chapters. and this time, zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks, tyrone power or antonio banderas but instead by workman-like actor reed hadley. while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here; as the title implies, he has a fighting legion to call upon.<br /><br />another big difference is that the setting isn't california. the story here take place in central mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established mexican republic. something, zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode, from corny "twang" bow sound effects to ludicrous acting. but overall, this represents one of the best republic serials of all time, and probably the best zorro one.<br /><br />the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering., and there's lots of great action - fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial.
