i swear i could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it! every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the acting, the script, the direction, and the general feeling of this movie. it's been a long time since i saw a movie that actually made me choke from laughter, reflect from sadness, and feel each intended feeling that comes through in this most excellent work! we need more movies like this!!! mike binder: are you listening???
