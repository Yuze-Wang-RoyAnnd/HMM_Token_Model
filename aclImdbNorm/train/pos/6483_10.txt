this excellent series, narrated by laurence olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the end of world war 2. the origins are not entirely examined fully from germany's fall at the hands of the versailles treaty which helped propel hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a 26-part series with so much to cram in. <br /><br />apart from the expected combat photography/action, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a world war 2 buff/fan. episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary, britain, germany, japan, russia and the u.s.a. were quite eye-opening. showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians, the death camps etc., were very well handled and exposed. i'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (of which it could be said i am one at 47!).<br /><br />certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of the new jet era beginning, with frank whittle's experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteor's combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me 262 - especially as the v-1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v2. this is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww2 brought forward from a more barren old science. but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated. <br /><br />a series to own as a box set in history terms, on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. jeremy isaacs and thames tv should be well proud.
