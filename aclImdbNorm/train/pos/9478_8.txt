this is a nice little movie with a nice story, that plays the most important role in the entire movie.<br /><br />it's a quite intriguing dramatic story, with also romance present in it. the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up. the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors. normally i'm not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good.<br /><br />of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies, produced in the west. in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era.<br /><br />i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better. for a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences. this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically. not that this is a bad thing, it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre.<br /><br />but oh well, this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it. in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint.<br /><br />8/10
