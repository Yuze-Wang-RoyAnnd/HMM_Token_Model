i went to see ashura as 2005 fantasia festival kickoff. man, that was one cool kick off. the director was supposed to be in montreal for the canadian premiere, but due to health reasons, he's still in japan...oh lord i hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies.<br /><br />the plot is pretty simple, but somewhat original...the demons are roaming in edo in japan and swordsmans called "demon wardens" are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of ashura, the demon goddess who's sleeping and supposedly is very kick-ass.<br /><br />it brings us to izumo...some kind of elite swordsman called "demon slayer" and his buddy jaku who's the typical violent jealous asshole...<br /><br />seems boring? well now it thickens....<br /><br />izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the "impression" that he was the demon, he never knew, but he did killed her. so izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in kabuki theater. in a boat joyride on a nice night, izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons...for the good cause, the cause of love...and damn...the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre.<br /><br />izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes...he is the total package...he knows how to fight(hell yeah he knows), he's witty, he's intelligent and he has that grit. you never have to yell :"no izumo, it's a trap" the guy already knows it he has that common sense. he's really the perfect hero.<br /><br />as far as cinematography goes, the esthetics are pretty interesting. it's by far, the movie that looks the most like a manga. it's creamed full of special effects and nothing, at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic...it's pretty amazing. lots of colours an "unreal" photography, other than that...it's pretty straightforward...but like i said, the main character is carrying the movie a must see, a tale lead by masterful hands
