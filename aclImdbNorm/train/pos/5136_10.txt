maybe the greatest film ever about jazz.<br /><br />it is jazz.<br /><br />the opening shot continues to haunt my reverie.<br /><br />lester, of course, is wonderful and out of this world.<br /><br />jo jones is always a delight (see the sound of jazz as well).<br /><br />if you can, find the music; it's available on cd.<br /><br />all lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous jewel.<br /><br />what shadows and light - what music - what a hat!
