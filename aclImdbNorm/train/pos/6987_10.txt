putting the ufo "thing" aside. this was the best documentary i've seen. factual reporting by neil and buzz... a must see. the interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped confidential in 1969 and only released in 2006. no documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief 47 minutes... the facts will blow you away, and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon... neil and buzz are probably the biggest hero's of our time. ever see a man save his own life? bet not. neil saves his life when only mili-seconds separated him from death. amazing to watch. it is a travesty people have not known all the details assosiated with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death, from a failing computer... 10 stars!
