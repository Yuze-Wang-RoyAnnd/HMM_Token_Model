i just watched this on turner classic movies last night, for the first time ever seeing it, and i loved it. i like lots of the older films, especially because of the absence of all the filthy language, and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films. i also think they were made much better in many (but not all) cases. jimmy stewart is a special favorite of mine. i just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and i enjoyed it thoroughly. if you feel the same way about the older films i don't think you can go wrong with this one. i believe "you've got mail" is a remake(even though slightly different and also a very enjoyable film.) of this film. for a relaxing evening with a movie you don't have to be ashamed of if your kids or anyone walks in on your viewing, get this,or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.
