remember the early days of pay per view? i do, and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t.v. as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone from ppv and asking to rent it. and then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap. well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv. and i remember almost every scene that was in the add. i've been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them. it's one that when its on its hard to shut off. all star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right. there are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category. it has enough action and laughs to sustain it. check it out if you dare!
