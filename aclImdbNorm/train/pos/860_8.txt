audiard made here a very interesting movie. it begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman, in its working universe as a secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected... hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life : but the guy is just coming out from jail. their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively. characters'description is profund, goes into details...both start to help each other; for she can read on lips, which reveals itself to be very useful for him...she will progressively evolve, far from what she was at first.<br /><br />it's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing, even if it turns into a film noir at the end. gesture is in particular beautifully observed in audiard's filming. emmanuelle devos should be nominated at the best actess cesar awards for her magistral play. action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". it's actually surprisingly entertaining : 8/10.
