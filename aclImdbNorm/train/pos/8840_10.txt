watching before the devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema. i have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me, the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience. it is one of those films that has stayed with me, and i continue to ponder and think about it.<br /><br />surely the dvd would illuminate some more of the themes and the film-making elements? which include: sidney lumet's comeback movie, the time-shifting technique deployed in the storytelling, the superb combination of lumet and masterson and why it works so well, the masterly direction, the relatively rare focus hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women, the under-presented, but nevertheless resonant marisa tomei's performance, and, of course, the superb hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie.<br /><br />phew! surely a masterful film. so imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated dvd - only to find no commentary, no behind-the-scenes, no interviews, no extras.<br /><br />hey - distributors - sort it out!
