any film that deals with bigotry in a positive manner is a film that should still be seen by current audiences as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of bigotry.<br /><br />aside from that, the film is really an old-fashioned love story..boy meets girl..boys loses girl...boy gets girl back....<br /><br />the weakest role goes to the late kent smith as lt. general webster(riccardo montalban is a close second)...my question would be how did he ever get to be a 3-star general...the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, it's a wonder they show him any respect at all.<br /><br />brando's southern accent is a little overdone, and some scenes have a few holes but overall, i enjoy the film every time i see it.<br /><br />red buttons is great...i always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles...as in button's case, often a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than a more traditional dramatic actor.
