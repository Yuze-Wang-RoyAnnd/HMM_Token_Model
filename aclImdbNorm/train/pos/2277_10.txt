while the movie does feel a bit long at times, it is well worth it. gordon directs in a style that reminds you of vonneguts writing styles. merciless, thoughtful, ironic, quirky, and dark, this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while, begging for answers to impossible questions. nolte, goodman, and arkin are all incredible. sheryl lee is wonderful as well, in a role that will remind us lynch fans of her laura/maddy days. do not miss this one!
