this is not "so bad that it is good," it is purely good! for those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) anyways, killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me. it is the single most genius text in cinematic history. i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa. it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard. i write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me, the likes of which we have never seen. it can only be taken in portions... its sort of exploitive... by now i'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. my comment ended a while ago. hopefully it works when i submit it now.
