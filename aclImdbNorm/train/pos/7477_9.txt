this movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film. tom cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain. this movie was not the best the first time i watched it, but after about 3 more times i decided that this is one of the best films that i have ever seen. it takes place in new york, and progresses on through his lifestyle. he discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (diaz). he goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination. this film was beyond my expectations, and is one of cruise's best films ever!
