i loved this movie. first, because it is a family movie. second, because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of hiv in a family, with far less hysteria than what i have normally seen in the movies. the brothers are very close, yet are not judgmental. their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but not needed in the end. i understand that leo's choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people, but i believed it was the right choice for him. i can't believe that this was a french television programme. it had great production values. i gave this movie a ten, and i think you will too, once you have seen it.
