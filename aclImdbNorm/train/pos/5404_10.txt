whoever says pokemon is stupid can die. this movie is superlative. i even shead a tear when celebei died. i don't cry much! this film is a touching animated thriller. <br /><br />in this fourth installment of pokemon, ash and friends must stop the bad jerk from making celebei the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball. in the time, sam and celebei travel through time and continuously are hunted by game hunters. i like the part with the double battle and sam has the apricorn pokeball (if you've played pokemon gold, silver, or crystal, you know what it is.)<br /><br />i also enjoyed having miramax in charge instead of warner brothers. putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea. the pokemon in this movie come to life more than ever.
