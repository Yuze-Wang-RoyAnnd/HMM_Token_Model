even though we know how the story ends, this is a gripping fly-on-the-wall film that plays almost like a political thriller. during the calm before the storm, we meet hugo chavez as a charismatic, larger than life man who has an unbreakable connection with the mestizos who make up 80% of the population but have previously been shut out of venezuela's political process and its oil wealth. he seems as devoted to them as they are to him. he travels the country at a hectic pace, reaching out to the campesinos, addressing huge crowds, hugging and kissing ordinary people, accepting letters on scraps of paper, and hearing pleas for help. the people are excited that one of their number has made it to the highest office in the land. there is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is coming to the festering barrios.<br /><br />but not everyone is happy with the situation. the pure-blood castillian spaniard elite who are a small minority but previously controlled all the wealth are full of bitterness and resentment. one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in the film is when an ann coulter lookalike, at a residents' meeting in an exclusive gated community, complains of the mestizos, "they have no concept of struggle or sacrifice." minutes later, a speaker tells the meeting to "beware of your domestic servants - they could be chavez supporters." duh! of course they are.<br /><br />in a late night interview alone with the film crew, chavez reveals something of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather. he can be a sensitive, poetic person, though with an impish, even clownish, sense of humor (like we saw when he addressed the un and called bush the devil.)<br /><br />then the storm starts to gather force as the coup organizers call for a mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters into changing the route at the last minute and marching on the presidential palace, knowing it is surrounded by chavez supporters and violence is inevitable.<br /><br />another element of the plot falls into place as snipers on rooftops begin to fire on the chavez supporters, some of whom fire back. the local equivalent of fox news shows this return fire and claims that chavez supporters are massacring protesters. then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! the protesters took a different route. needless to say the footage of the empty street was edited out by the rabidly anti-chavez private tv stations (who had been airing a constant barrage of propaganda calling chavez mentally ill and sexually fixated on fidel castro.) immediately after the coup, we see the ringleaders and their media propaganda masters openly bragging on tv about how they had manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents alike.<br /><br />the filmmakers continue to be at the heart of this chaotic, fast-changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. chavez eventually surrenders to avoid bloodshed but refuses to resign and is whisked away to an offshore island where a plane awaits to take him - where? the us? how can the remaining cabinet members avoid arrest and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-wealthy businessmen who are closely linked to the bush administration? watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />if your only knowledge of hugo chavez and venezuela is from the us media, then you know nothing. he is not an "unelected tyrant" and does not "rule by decree" - he is enormously popular, having been elected and re-elected several times with over 60% of the vote (something george bush junior has never achieved) and the devotion he inspires in ordinary venezuelan people is ultimately the reason why the coup fails.<br /><br />this is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. the skill of the filmmakers is in being unobtrusive and letting the story unfold through the voices of venezuelans at every level from the barrio to the presidential palace, the tumultuous scenes, the chaos and confusion out of which a coherent whole emerges that is tense, riveting and moving. not to be missed!
