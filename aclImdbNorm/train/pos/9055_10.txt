this is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good! even though some of the actors and actresses weren't very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old! it was funny, gross and just all out a very good movie. in most parts i just didn't know what was going to happen next! i was like i think this is going to happen, wait i think this is going to happen. all age groups will love this movie! in some parts i couldn't stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts i was totally grossed out and i couldn't believe what i was seeing! i am definitely going to see this movie again! it is one of those movies where it can't get boring. every time you see it is so suspenseful. i definitely recommend seeing this movie!!
