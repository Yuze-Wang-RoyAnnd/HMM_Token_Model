i keep watching this movie over and over and over. i have to watch it at least once a week. i am from africa and looking at that movie taught me some things that i didn't even know about africa. denzel's movies are all full of lessons for people of walks of life. i wish he was my own brother. i have also seen and love your masala mississipi. what a thrilling situation. when denzel was trying to hook his brother up on the job, reminds me of my teen ages when my brother was always mad with me about getting myself busy all the time. my brother was always caring for my old father and he wants to see me the same way too. by the way where did denzel get that african accent from in the cry freedom movie? i have first seen that movie in africa and i didn't know then that denzel was american till i moved down here.
