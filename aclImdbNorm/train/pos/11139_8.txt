hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler (jon voigt) and his lame con-man sidekick (dustin hoffman), soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills.<br /><br />a daring film for its time, and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the '60s. symbolic of the "end of innocence" in american films, since it was the only x-rated film to win a best picture oscar.<br /><br />jon voigt is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body, but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk. befriended by a lame con-man (dustin hoffman), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in florida, a land his friend "ratzo" dreams of living in.<br /><br />but even in this final quest, the two are losers. john schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by waldo salt, and john barry's haunting "midnight cowboy" theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation.<br /><br />summing up: a true american classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life.
