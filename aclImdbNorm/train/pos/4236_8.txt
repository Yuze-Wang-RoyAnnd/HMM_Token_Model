take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. it's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. visually, it's incredible. everything else was just ok. <br /><br />for what it is, i think the movie is awesome, but i like everything burton has done. people need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b/c of this movie. it wasn't supposed to be a remake, and it's not. <br /><br />the ending was cool. . i took it as a parallel universe.
