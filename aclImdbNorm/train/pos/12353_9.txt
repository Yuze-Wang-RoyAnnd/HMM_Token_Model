a tragically wonderful movie... brings us to a japan that does not exist anymore. despite hollywood's technical expertise, i have yet to see a (hollywood) movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea... tom cruise's the last samurai looked liked the last installment of the lord of the rings in trying to capture rural old japan.<br /><br />if you like serene but intense story lines, this is a must see film. it will be a respite from hollow flashy films much like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw. i think this is one of kurosawa's better stories.<br /><br />even if it's a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such settings, it did not turn into a skin flick. the characters are full of depth and act with much intensity.
