one of the best movies out there. yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest, but an excellent plot and concept. great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas. something different from the usual movies and great fun. one of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. post world war 3 and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while. the sets are not amazing, but simple and worked for the overall look of the film. this movie is very hard to find on dvd, but also on vhs. check it out cause i have loved it since it came out. not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen. take a look and think like a child. it's a great view and very fun.
