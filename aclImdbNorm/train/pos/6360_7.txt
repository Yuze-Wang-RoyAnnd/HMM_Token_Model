i have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down.<br /><br />why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be.<br /><br />this film is supposed to be a light hearted, tonge in cheek, family comedy, things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults, and that is exactly what this film does.<br /><br />i laughed my nuts off at this film, i thought carey put in a great performance and the whole film (if watched at christmas) really give you a bit of festive cheer<br /><br />so to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not "taxi driver" or "the godfather" and take films for what they are supposed to be, entertainment!!
