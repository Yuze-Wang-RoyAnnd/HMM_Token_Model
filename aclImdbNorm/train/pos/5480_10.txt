this is a great movie, it shows what our government will to to other countries if we don't like their government. this isn't as bad as what reagan and bush number one did to south america, but the us still has no business messing around with other countries like this. this movies also proves that american media spouts government propaganda. this is exactly what they did to aristide in haiti. the reason this coup against chavez didn't succeed is chavez was elected with over 90% of the vote.<br /><br />this movie isn't just a political documentary, it would still be a great movie if it were a drama, it's amazing that this is real.<br /><br />the other reviewer is lying when he says "chavez seizes the airwaves", the private media is running anti chavez propaganda all the time.
