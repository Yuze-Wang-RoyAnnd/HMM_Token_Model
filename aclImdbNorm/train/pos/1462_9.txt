in this documentary we meet roger, the rich manager of a factory in china that makes beads and other trinkets sold and traded at mardi gras in new orleans. roger claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides, but interviews with four of them tell quite another story. the girls' bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of mardi gras itself. filmmaker david redmon should be lauded for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a chinese factory compound, and for landing a revealing on-camera interview with the head of the u.s. company that imports and sells the beads. the movie is compellingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind those ubiquitous "made in china" labels.
