there are few really hilarious films about science fiction but this one will knock your sox off. the lead martian's jack nicholson take-off is side-splitting. the plot has a very clever twist that has be seen to be enjoyed. this is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all. make some popcorn and have a great evening.
