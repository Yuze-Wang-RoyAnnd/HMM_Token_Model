this show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl... but it's set on the 70's. that's the only difference that it has with other tv comedies. i don't know how you can like this show. its humor is pathetic! i mean, the jokes are so direct... a typical dialog is this: "fez: oh, jackie i want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) jackie: fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) fez: oh yes i am. (audience cheers and applauds)" this isn't funny. i think that if it didn't have those laughs (i don't know how you call that in english, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. this isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. i like most of the american comedies, but this isn't good at all. i would give it 4 out of 10. (sorry for my poor english again.)
