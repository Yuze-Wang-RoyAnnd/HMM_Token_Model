this story is a familiar one in the long-running tom and jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s, the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be evicted if they don't catch the mouse (jerry). tom has an unnamed buddy ("butch?") living in the house with him, so this really upsets "mammy two shoes" who can't believe that they have a mouse despite two cats in the house.<br /><br />anyway, the one who catches jerry can stay while the other gets the boot, so the competition is on!<br /><br />even though it's familiar territory i still enjoyed this because the cartoon had enough original sight gags to make entertaining. you not only had the cats competing against each but jerry in the equation as well, so there were enough good gags to definitely recommend if you are a tom & jerry fan.
