i don't want to spend to long here rambling about the plot- you've seen the trailer, and if you haven't its online. i don't recommend seeing it though- it was poorly crafted and didn't pack any of the laughs or magic from the film. so those avoiding this film due to its lousy trailer should give this one a chance. it's really funny. i was blown away by the cleverness and originality in this film. the first 40 minutes had me on the floor in hysterics- my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad austin powers film in the final 20. this however, is one of the few films where the campy ending didn't make me dislike the rest of the film (which is normally the case). everyone gives a great performance (especially joan cusack) and there are some really great moments throughout. i personally plan on seeing it again when it comes out- only to catch all the details which i was laughing over during the first viewing!
