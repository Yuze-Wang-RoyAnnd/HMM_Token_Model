this is actually a groovy-neat little flick, made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness . it takes a little while to warm up to it. the acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen-like charm. after a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries. the characters all develop a quirky charm, especially "richard". forget anthony hopkins, maidens is the guy i'd hire to play a raving psychopath. he just seems to enjoy it so very much! mixed in with the scenes of mad-slasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character, "the midnight skater" zooming through the campus in a black hoodie, looking for all the world like a cross between the grim reaper and, say, the silver surfer. these shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the skater seem almost ominous. the soundtrack features some very fun garage-punk tunes and the raspy, raucous meanness of it meshes well with the film's mood. thumbs upish, i say.
