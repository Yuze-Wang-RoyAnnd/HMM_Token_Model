this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham's short tales. the first one is the verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can't read nor write. so what does he do? opens a tobacco shop, of course!<br /><br />the second is mr. know-all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten, until i heard the familiar introduction. another 15 minute one, and also very good. it worked better on film than in a book for me, but then perhaps that's because i was only 14 the last time, afterall.<br /><br />the 3rd one is nearly a let-down. almost an hour in length, it simply drags. it's not all that bad, but not as quick and snappy as the last 2. i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour, and found that it still made sense and really i hadn't missed a thing!<br /><br />overall i give them 8, 9, and 6 out of 10, respectively.
