it probably isn't fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten, but oh well.......<br /><br />from a standpoint of acting, how could any actor fail with these characters? each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life. tony soprano-while a mob "capo" and suffering from mental illness, still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive. each of his men, you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism. it definitely brings out a sort "nosey" side in each and every viewer, and i include myself in this!<br /><br />while some above don't care for bracco, i have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since good fellas. she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason, that makes him decent, that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long, if ever. she is simply put, his savior. (not speaking in religious tones)<br /><br />but the knockout performance here is without doubt, edie falco. to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series, "oz" and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress. she has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress, something only actresses like merle streep can get away with. a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles. but as i have mentioned before, with a characters a strong as these, how can any actor fail?<br /><br />livia's strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself. she is a survivor, as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors. she is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband's business, yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey. she is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then tony himself.<br /><br />all in all, the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january 2000 to see the next season. this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series. it was what brought the larry sanders show, sex and the city, dream on, and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them. too much space in between seasons and very sporadic. until then, i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled.
