how to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach.<br /><br />it's actually a story of sidney young(simon pegg) breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way. simon pegg made an ok appearance, slightly worse than his usual. movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments, and those moments are really hilarious.<br /><br />i recommend this fun and worth watching american with english cream comedy to all people who just wanna sit, relax and enjoy movie for what it is. if you're about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it.
