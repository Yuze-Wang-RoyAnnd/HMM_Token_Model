the 40 year-old virgin (2005) **** steve carell, catherine keener, paul rudd, romany malco, seth rogen, elizabeth banks, leslie mann, jane lynch, gerry bednob, shelley malil, kat dennings. hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular andy stitzer (wonderfully played by perennial second banana carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the a-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in southern california who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (rudd, malco & rogen, each one degree funnier than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. what follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious mother (the marvelous keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within andy. a surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy; the funniest since "there's something about mary" with a shrewdly observant script by director judd apatow and carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate david caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb. a true winner and an instant classic; the funniest film of the year.
