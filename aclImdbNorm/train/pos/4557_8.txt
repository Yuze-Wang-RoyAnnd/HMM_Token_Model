i thought hugh o'conor was astounding as the young christy brown, and really deserved greater recognition for his role. i couldn't believe how well he played the part. of course, daniel day-lewis was brilliant too. my favourite scene is where the boys are playing football and christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty! amazing performances by the two christys (and other also).
