i think i truly love this film . "prix de beaute" was originally a silent film but later dubbed into french in 1930. despite having someone else's voice dubbed over hers, this remains a stunning tour de force for louis brooks. the fact that her singing voice is dubbed by the legendary edith piaf helps to mollify us purists about the dubbing deception. <br /><br />this is the story of lulu and we first see her at a resort with her macho boyfriend, andre (georges charlia) and their friend antonin (augusto bandini). lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs: we see her inside the car changing into her bathing costume. lulu is very free with showing off her body and this does not sit well with the irksome andre. when lulu considers applying for the title of 'miss europe' we know that a happy ending is not going to be sitting at the end of easy street. <br /><br />the film seems to focus a lot on men ogling beautiful women. we see plenty of bathing beauties and the reactions of the men staring at them. but at the center of it all is the magnificent louise brooks. <br /><br />if you don't mind watching films from the bygone eras, then consider checking out this one. louise brooks is not a name that most average movie buffs may readily know but as soon as you see her you will be mesmerised and you'll want to know more. also check her out in 'pandora's box' if you can find it.<br /><br />be wary of the us kino dvd release. i don't know if their projection speed is correct. a lot of the scenes appear to be shown at too fast a speed. this may have been the way they were shot. i don't know. but since it's the only way to see this film, it's worth swallowing that one minor bitter pill.
