forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films. its influence was felt for more than a decade. however, certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit, and the film's sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help. but, the story's compelling central idea involving the ancient,extinct krell civilization and "monsters from the id" hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant "must see" movie. what i'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible. the movie has never really looked that good on home video and it's elements are in dire need of restoration. i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic.
