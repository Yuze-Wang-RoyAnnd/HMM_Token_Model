089: footlight parade (1933) - released 9/30/1933, viewed 5/5/07.<br /><br />the ice cream cone is invented in new york.<br /><br />kevin: after a long and busy break, we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros. this time it's the ultra-fast paced footlight parade, starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent. i am 100% certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent, who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute. joan blondell is also excellent as the acid-tongued secretary-turned-love interest. the ruby keeler/dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable. one thing that baffled me was berkeley's performances themselves, which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage, let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards. obviously busby doesn't let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over-the-top musical numbers he can possibly conjure. i liked nearly all of this movie until the end, with the shamelessly offensive number "shanghai lil," which, as one can guess, is about as stomach-turning as racially distasteful performances come.<br /><br />doug: six movies in three months. got to be a new record. anyway
