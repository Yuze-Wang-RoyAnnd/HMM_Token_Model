this independent, b&w, dv feature consistently shocks, amazes and amuses with it's ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them. it's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff, yet as absurd as much of the film should be, there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded, keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here. this film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad. that seems to be the heart of the film. for as insane and off the wall as things get, leon, the 30 yr. old paperboy-protagonist, always tries to keep it together. he's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best, so that everyone can have what they want.<br /><br />the acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive. van meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics. just as the characters in the film do, we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath. <br /><br />majkowski is a true genius here. he takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real. it is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat. it's a true testament to the skill of majkowski and all involved that this film, with it's grating plot and characters, never once works our nerves. majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and repugnant, and somehow given it heart and humor. this is a unique film. not to be missed. <br /><br />
