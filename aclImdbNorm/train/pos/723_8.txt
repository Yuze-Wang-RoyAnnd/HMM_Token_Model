riff randell is a wildly, obsessed fan of the rock group; the ramones and so are most of the students in the school. but a new tyrant of a principal, ms. togar thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students, especially the music from the ramones. so, when riff finds out they're performing in town, she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends. but when ms. togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets. while, this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff, but riff's friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom. but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song.<br /><br />fun! fun! fun! yep, that's right 'rock n roll high school' doesn't drift away from it main focus
