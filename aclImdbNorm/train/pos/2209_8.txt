in my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity skit show. i enjoyed seeing greg kinnear as the host. there are many reasons why i said that. even though hal sparks was an okay host, i sometimes wish that greg kinnear hadn't left. if you ask me, it seems that nobody stays with a tv show throughout its entire run anymore. still, i enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities. if you ask me, that was pretty darn funny. before i wrap this up, i must say that i kind of miss this show. now, in conclusion, i highly recommend this show to all you die-hard sketch show fans. you will really enjoy it.
