it may have not been up for academy awards and admittedly, it's pretty cheesy, but it's just so much fun! nothing makes me smile like bill and ted. lovable, optimistic, and hilarious, bill and ted are a great way to unwind.<br /><br />although i love excellent adventure, bogus journey is funnier to me. death is flippin hilarious and bill and ted are even more endearing. people give me grief about loving this movie, but only really pretentious movie-watchers will say it's not even a bit entertaining. if you like this, you'll probably also be a fan of wayne's world, dude where's my car, and dumb and dumber. admit it, though foolish, they make you grin and turn your tickle box over. so watch them just for kicks and giggles!!
