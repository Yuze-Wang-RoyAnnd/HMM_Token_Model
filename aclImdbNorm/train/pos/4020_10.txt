pinjar by mr dwivedi is an awesome movie. its definitely the greaest and finest of 2003. there are very good performances in it. dwivedi knows what he can extract from mast urmila. she is like u have never seen before. one true great performance. along with her is a fine actor manoj bajpai, who has shown bollywood what he is with bhiku mhatre. the movie is about a girl(urmila) living in pre-partition pakistan. she is from a punjabi family livin in a small town. she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going-on-for-years kinda fight with the punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns as urmila's arranged marriage is due in few days. this movie is truly a very good movie. the storyline is solid with an amazing screenplay. all the performances like lillete dubey, isha koppikar (u wont believ but she can act as well besides jus dancin on khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. those sets with pre-partition pakistan, costumes, cinematography, sound, background score add to the positive points. from the start till the end u r stuck to u'r seat with the question whats next? this movie is not jus worth watchin but deserved to be a part of your movie collection. the ultimate scene is the end of the movie. i would suggest all those no-kabhi-khushi-kabhi-gum-and-no-dil-to-pagal-hai crowd to watch this amazing flick. my rating: 10/10.
