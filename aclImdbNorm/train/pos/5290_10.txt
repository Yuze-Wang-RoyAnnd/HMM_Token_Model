going for something far away from the deliberately gross stuff that he usually makes, john waters (happy birthday, john!) made this parody of the celebrity/art world. edward furlong plays the title character, a working-class teenager in baltimore who loves to photograph things. when a new york agent (lili taylor) discovers his work, she offers him his big break, which he accepts. but once he hits it big, he has to reconsider everything.<br /><br />basically, "pecker" looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity. the sort of thing that we might expect, sure, but with waters directing, there's always a few things to shock us (you'll know them when you see them). i certainly recommend it. also starring christina ricci, mink stole and patty hearst.
