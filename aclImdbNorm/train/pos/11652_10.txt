i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one. it deals with issues that most directors shy away from, my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldn't buy a copy for my friend!<br /><br />it's a touching story about how people with eating disorders don't necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies. it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of.
