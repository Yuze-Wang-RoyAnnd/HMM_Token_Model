the title sequence shows the credits written on a rain-soaked sidewalk as people trod on it; music is provided by someone whistling alfred newman's "street scene." then we meet det. sgt. mark dixon (dana andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man wasn't: a guy on the right side of the law. but he's pretty vicious for a good guy. after several complaints over his roughing people up, his boss, insp. nicholas foley (robert f. simon), demotes him. foley tells him he's a good man, but needs to get his head on straight and be more like det. lt. thomas (karl malden), who has just gotten a promotion.<br /><br />meanwhile, tommy scalise (gary merrill, in a splendidly slimy performance) has an illegal dice game going and is looking to make a sucker out of the rich ted morrison (harry von zell), who was brought in by ken paine (craig stevens) and his beautiful wife morgan (gene tierney). she figures out too late her husband is using her as a decoy, and paine strikes her when she refuses to play along. the chivalrous morrison intervenes but paine knocks him out cold. that seems to be the worst of it, but later it turns out the guy is dead; and paine looks guilty.<br /><br />but this won't be paine's story. soon dixon has fallen in love with morgan
