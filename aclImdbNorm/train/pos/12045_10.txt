i first watched this film when i was a kid and is the only time in my life that i can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene. i remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation i might add (to my surprise i only found it on the web in the states when it was made in england!) when i watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same, of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too. this is in my opinon the scariest film ever made, hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit pony and trap (crap), pardon the pun. what is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates i have never heard so many screams, blokes as well! even the sight of the video brings the fear of god into me of that one particular scene, and left me feeling that i will never walk alone again in the dark!!!!
