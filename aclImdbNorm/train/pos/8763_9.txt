this movie is cold, bare truth. often we think "oh no, that won't happen to me." but it can. drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly (or tricked) into doing things for smugglers. the story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them, only wanted a exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare. people need to know that these sort of events aren't improbable or exaggerated - this is a major problem in today's society.<br /><br />i would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie. it is very emotional and raw. well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory.
