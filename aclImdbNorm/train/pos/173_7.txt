actually, goldie hawn is from washington (takoma park, maryland), but i digress. this is sort of a mr. smith goes to washington type of movie, with some variations but the same premise. i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn. the story is interesting, but it's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot's life. it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time. it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous, i had to laugh. (possible spoiler ahead). it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up. and the speech she made at the end...beautiful. too bad not many people have guts like that in real life.
