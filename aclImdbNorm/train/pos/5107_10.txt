what an overlooked 80's soundtrack. i imagine john travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was 80s cheese. clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in style. the best was his lousy texas accent. compare that to friday night lights.i suggest watching cocktail and stir crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film. also, as a side note made in america with ted danson and whoopie goldberg is an awesomely bad movie. i was so shocked to realize i had never watched it. one more weird movie of this genre would have to include cadilac man with robin williams. just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies.. tom cruise, richard pryor, robin williams and john travolta
