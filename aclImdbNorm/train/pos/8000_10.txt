...dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless. the film is excellent, the acting by both denzel and dakota (she will go sky high, trust me on that)are just fabulous, and the plot is mind blowing. actually "fabulous" is a small word to use for such talented actors. the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film. if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films, you still haven't watched your favorite one yet...trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling. the film is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever...just don't miss it
