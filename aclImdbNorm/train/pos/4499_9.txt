this gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on dvd years after its pbs broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. my only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger manchester accents are difficult at times. luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. robson green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. francesca annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty. (the love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. the mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries. as russell baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing "reckless" -- but you'll have plenty of fun. (the sequel, a part of the dvd box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. you won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before.)
