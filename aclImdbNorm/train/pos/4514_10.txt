i've recently watched this movie, in a lazy sunday afternoon, with some friend of mine and we have a lot of fun! this movie is a masterpiece of trash. try to watch it with this purpose! it hadn't been expected, of course, but the performance provided by the actors (and alberto tomba is absolutely the best), the weak script and the low-cost budget had created an amazing mix of foolish things. tomba was just retired from alpine ski racing, where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. tomba won three olympic gold medals, two world championships, and nine world cup season titles. seriously about the director: nobody knows why damiano damiani he has signed this movie. all the other damiani's directions are considerable.
