so, every year there is at least one movie, that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success, because from the moment of production, even before one simple shot is filmed, everybody's picking on this movie... there is a long list of these kind of movies, and in the end, some are really bad (battlefield earth (2000)), some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable (catwoman (2004), elektra (2005)) and then there are a few, which actually are really great for what they are, but no one admits! i mean, my gosh, just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on, not everybody has to join them. so yeaaah, maybe those movies aren't perfect, but c'mon, how many movies are? not every movie is supposed to be a new the lord of the rings! not everybody will enjoy these movies, but i bet there are more than who admit they do. hudson hawk (1991), who is just hysterical funny, color of night (1994), which may not be oscar-worthy, but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists, swept away (2002), which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance, gigli (2003), which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former "bennifer"-couple, and this year it's "basic instinct 2"! well, when i heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies i was very sceptically, and although i really love sharon stone i stayed sceptically until i've finally seen this movie. and really, i was very positively surprised! i can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here. it never simply copies the original, it has a quite clever story, has tension, action, humor and the absolutely stunning sharon stone reprising the role of her life! with 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s, but it's more than her being beautiful, it's brilliantly acted, with all her looks, her famous smile, the way she speaks and moves... from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her. it's simply a pleasure to watch her as catherine tramell, and all of the other actors deliver solid performances, too! so i really can't see what's wrong with this movie... it has a dark, thrilling, sexy and gritty look, strong performances, and you never felt bored! maybe the story isn't oscar-caliber, but it never even tries to be! it's an entertainment-movie, and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion! so give it a try!
