in 1948 this was my all-time favorite movie. betty grable's costumes were so ravishing that i wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that. douglas fairbanks, jr., was irresistible as the dashing hungarian officer. silly and fluffy as this movie might appear at first, when i was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women. i saw it again the other day; i was surprised to find that it still did.
