"the luzhin defence" is, in the foreground, a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant (turturro) who becomes consumed by the game and, in the background via flashbacks, his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become. factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest (watson) and former "mentor" (wilson) respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of italy's lake como and the intensity of high chess play. an excellent film for those into period dramas, the auteur's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film.
