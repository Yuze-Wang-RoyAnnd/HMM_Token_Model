a single mother(diane keaton) finds herself working several minimum-wage jobs. when she gets fired, she finds that she is unable to support her sons(michael seater and colin roberts), the latter of whom has asthma. then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs. soon enough, she gets addicted to the drugs that she is selling. her life comes crashing down, especially when her kids, namely her oldest son, find out the truth and threaten to leave her. then, she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her kids but can she protect her family from the drug lords who she worked for? <br /><br />wow! this lifetime movie has some of the best acting i have ever seen! diane keaton overacts a lot, and her character comes off as crazy but she was extremely convincing. she is much better suited to drama than to comedy. however, the best performance in the movie comes from michael seater, who plays her oldest son. he is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but trying to be the adult in the family. his acting was especially great in the scenes where he confronts his mom about the drugs. colin roberts, who plays the younger son, also does a great job.<br /><br />a movie well worth watching, especially because of the acting from michael seater and diane keaton!
