well, maybe not immediately before the rodney king riots, but even a few months before was timely enough. my parents said that they saw it and the next thing you know, the police got acquitted and la got burned to the ground. it just goes to show the state of race relations in america. the plot has white mack (kevin kline) and african-american simon (danny glover) becoming friends after simon saves mack's life in the black ghetto. meanwhile, movie producer davis (steve martin in a serious role) thinks that gratuitous violence is really cool...until he gets shot. there's also some existentialism in the movie: mack and his family come to realize that they aren't living as they really want.<br /><br />it seems that "crash" has somewhat renewed people's interest in race relations, but this one came out much earlier. maybe we'll never be able to have stable race relations in this country. but either way, "grand canyon" is a great movie. it affirms kevin kline as my favorite actor. also starring mary mcdonnell, mary-louise parker and alfre woodard.
