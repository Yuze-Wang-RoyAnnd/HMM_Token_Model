i am writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the 2002 gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival in sydney, australia.<br /><br />when their father dies, two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from aids, they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation. the two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses. i do have one qualm about the movie though - whilst the brother who is dying acts sick, he doesn't look it. a person of 0 t4 cells would look quite ill - not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed. a small gripe, but one that makes it a bit less realistic. despite that one small gripe, the perfect son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it- do. i'm hoping for a dvd release in the near future!
