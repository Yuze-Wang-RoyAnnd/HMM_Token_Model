even though the shining is over a quarter of a century old, i challenge anyone to not get freaked out by jack nicholson's descent into madness. this is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. the twins, the elevator of blood, redrum, the crazy nonsense "writing"... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. the film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. it has the classic mystery of hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. and it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.
