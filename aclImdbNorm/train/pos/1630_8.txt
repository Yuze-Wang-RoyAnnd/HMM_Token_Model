i may very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film. i also saw this movie when it came out, and i agree with the last post that up the acedemy was way ahead of its' time. the humor in the film itself is pure mad magazine. i don't see why mad stand behind this feature. it was also one of the few films of the early 80's to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from l.a. at the time. i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day. what can i say? there are definitely worst movies out there. i don't consider porky's to be as funny as up the academy, there are some really good laughs throughout the film, and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid. hey, nobody said this was going to be the maltese falcon.
