fay, the sister of the notorious nobel prize-winning smut poet simon grim, still loves henry fool. their son receives an ingenious orgy-in-a-box from an undisclosed sender and a chase across three continents ensues, involving a supremely sad-sack collection of government agents, terrorists, flight attendants, and bellhops.<br /><br />parker posey delivers a perfectly timed comic performance, including some brilliant physical work. with strong contributions by jasmin tabatabai and saffron burrows, fay grim proves in the best billy wilder tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in trouble.<br /><br />another good score by hartley (and thanks in the credits to the american academy in berlin, where hartley served as a fellow in fall 2004).
