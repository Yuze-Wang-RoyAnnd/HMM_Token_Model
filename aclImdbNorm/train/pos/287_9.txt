we loved the movie. i am a mother to two little men. i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character. moveis where money is not the most important thing. and family's are forever and love means more then words. <br /><br />i do wish we saw more of the davis family. but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did "please don't be over". we both wish actors would not change.the new actors were good replacement tho.<br /><br />my 9 year old son loved this movie too. asked me to go buy them all. he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something. family should all see this move buy it for friends . help bring back a time of values. we will be reading the books now that we are hooked. really hope to see more. be blessed happy moving
