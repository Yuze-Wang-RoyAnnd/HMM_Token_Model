first ever viewing: july 21, 2008<br /><br />very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film. now 40 years old, it has lost none of it's power. neil simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations. jack lemmon and walter matthau give great comedic performances. neil simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on.<br /><br />one of the best written and acted hollywood comedies of all time!<br /><br />surprisingly, only nominated for 2 academy awards: "best adapted screenplay" and "best film editing". hollywood rarely awards comedies, no matter how well they are made.
