over her dead body was a nice little movie.it was decent and entertaining, while still being pretty funny.there were a few clich'e's, but i found most stuff fresh.at first i didn't think it was going to be good at all,when it started out.if you can get past the first 20 minutes though,the movie starts getting more interesting.this film wasn't burst out in laughter hilarious,and wasn't oh my gosh wonderful.it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was.i don't see how this movie was bad.it's rating is just a bit too low.i could've dealt with a 5.5,but a 4.8?also,giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful.it was pretty good,and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1,which is what most people gave it.
