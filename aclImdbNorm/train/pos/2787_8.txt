originally i rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer - and i was not disappointed that way (except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes). as a dad i suppose i was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but i have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays (as uncomfortable as i feel with the topic). in a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices. this dilemma is introduced by a young british-born teen girl - jasminder (jess) - of east-indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer. the pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. <br /><br />the multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships. <br /><br />in summary, the soccer scenes are great (lots to learn in slowmo) and while i didn't need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going.
