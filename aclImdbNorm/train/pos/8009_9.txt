ah, true memories. i lived in holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every sunday evening and later tuesdays. i saw it during my 14-16s. very good for my (at the time school-)english, as dutch tv provides subtitles for other languages, except for kiddies shows nowadays. so you would hear the original voices and language. - the best series were the first three ones and then after the third series, the great character, nazi von gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (i don't think they ever really caught him, he always escaped, leaving room to have him appear again in a next story) because evidently the series also was distributed to germany, and a nazi enemy wouldn't go over very well! too bad, because geoffrey toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent nazi aristocrat, who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on england. it was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series, but ronald leigh-hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal. they were very believable to me at the time and as a kid i could just imagine to be part of these youngsters, who at the time were about four years older than me. it was a very exciting series to me, standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with "the prisoner" as well. i hope they will publish a good quality dvd of the series, that would be wonderful. even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch. the later series were not as good, watered down and just not as much fun as the first three. hopefully they also find the other series with von gelb to be put on dvd. greetings from canada.
