i love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family jeopardy, a romantic love story, and a very sad story plot. everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film. it was such a great mixture of actors and actresses and with some laughs and a lot of cries this film deserves to get plenty of awards. with the mention of beautiful scenario, and although i would relate this film to the notebook and the family stone, it was sort of much more cunning, sad, and brilliant than those films. the evening tells of a love story between an old woman dreaming back to her younger years, and her two daughters stay by her side while she is not well. the story dating back is so strongly told and wonderful i was sitting on the edge of my seat. you really get to know all the characters and by the end, i was wanting to watch it all over again. this is a amazingly sad and vividly acted and plotted movie that is really one of a kind and should be seen by all for how wonderful it really is. all the performances are astonishing and the film captures your attention from the very beginning and never lets go. i loved it, and am so glad that i watched it for it was truly an astonishing film...
