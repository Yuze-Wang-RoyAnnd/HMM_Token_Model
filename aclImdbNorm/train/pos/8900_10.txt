this is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50's! i just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music. anyway, i love the way the blob looks. i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party. another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night, just like halloween ii.<br /><br />when steve and jane are making out, they see a meteor fall from space. inside the meteor is the blob. whenever the blob consumes a person, it grows bigger and bigger. they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster, but no one believes them until later. can anything stop this blobby creature? i highly recommend the blob!!!
