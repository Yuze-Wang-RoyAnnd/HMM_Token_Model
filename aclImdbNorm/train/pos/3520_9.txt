this is a "b series" film noir, and my vote reflects its membership in that genre. i saw this film last night at a left-bank cinema in paris, where it opened a two-week film noir run. the film has some flaws, yes, but far too many delicious elements to ignore.<br /><br />as the previous reviewer remarked, the drumming scene is incredible! (b-movies could tread where a-movies were forbidden to enter!) and the plot is intriguing. regarding franchot tone, however, i beg to disagree: to me, he's suitably mysterious; just the right shade of creepy. one must bear in mind that there's a sort of german expressionism happening here (the director, robert siodmark, was a german who came to hollywood during the war), and so an air of exaggeration fits into the whole of this film. at least it does for me.<br /><br />however, it's the gorgeous ella raines who, in only her third credited performance, held this viewer entranced throughout the film. a "girl friday" type with a strong resemblance to gene tierney, it's a wonder that she didn't become a household name. but she's so good here that i've just ordered another film of hers ('impact') off the internet, and i can't wait to see it as well.
