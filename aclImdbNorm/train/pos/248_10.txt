'ned kelly' is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero. we are taken into the world of ned, his best friend, joe byrne, and the other members of the kelly gang, as the film explains and perhaps justifies ned's actions.<br /><br />there is an exceptional cast present, who all give stellar performances, which brings the film to life. (great job, heath!) orlando bloom was fantastic as joe, playing the role of quiet, loyal ladiesman very well. i was swept up in the moment. for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan, alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />some aspects of the film are fictional, and as an avid ned kelly fan (and supporter), was slightly disappointed by this. perhaps also the film could've gone longer, to cover more of the kelly gang's/ned's life - i felt not enough was covered.<br /><br />regardless of a few flaws, this is a moving film, which stirs all sorts of emotions. (and hey, i'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than mick jagger trying to portray ned...)
