fortunately for us real mccoy fans (most likely all baby boomers who grew-up in the late 50's and 60's), three of the adult actors/actress appeared when they did for the reunion show, in 2000. tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter. as enjoyable as it was to see luke, sugar-babe, and pepino together again, it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman? it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999, but i'm not sure how. there is no information about hassie on the internet, that i can find. very curious why they were not even mentioned? it was so conspicuous, their absence from the reunion show, that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself (if still alive) either, 1) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted, or 2) tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia (like the rest of us), they seemed to have vanished. therefore, it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together.<br /><br />otherwise, the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done. they made no bones about it ... it was grandpa who made the show such a success. i remember, as a child, mimicking grandpa's gimp walk and my parents laughing (as i'm sure a million other children did back then). one annoyance that did bother me a bit, was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion ... at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point. in fact, although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak-out and say too much during the reunion show. unfortunate, since i wanted to hear from all three, equally. all in all, the reunion show was a real treat for me. i've watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each time.<br /><br />dodgerdude
