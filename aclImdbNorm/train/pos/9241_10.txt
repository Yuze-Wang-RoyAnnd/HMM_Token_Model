hey people, what's up. it's me man, the one and only mike "sonny sakura killer" kelly. you know........ you can't really write a review on the script of sakura, cause there we didn't have one. as far as i know, the story was just made up as we went along. i had the best time of my life making that film, and got so much stank that i ran out of jism...........fun times. so glad that you all enjoyed the film. i really didn't get to do the fights that i had envisioned. every time i set up some moves, the fight director kept changing them. still, i had a blast and met some really great people. especially the purple female ninja who has seem to fall of the film-making scene.
