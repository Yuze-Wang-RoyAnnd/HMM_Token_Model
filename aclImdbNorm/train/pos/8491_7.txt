i saw this movie when it was new. later i rented it in japan after having been here three years, afraid that i would cringe when i viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience. the movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between japan and pennsylvania (where i'm from). not all the stuff is factually spot on, but the tone is perfect.<br /><br />i'm still in japan many years later, and i continue to enjoy this film for its even-handed treatment of the two sides in the story. interestingly, although the japanese-american actors spoke japanese in the original, the dialog is redubbed in the japan version to cover up obvious second-language delivery problems.<br /><br />i noticed one reviewer uses this in a japanese class. i think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with japan by watching this film than by reading any of the "serious" books on the matter (most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing japanese companies).<br /><br />don't be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who, among other things, found it implausible that the japanese would want to build cars in the us. (of course, the japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction.) this is a very warm and funny movie that i would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clich'es, like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music. michael keaton has never been funnier.
