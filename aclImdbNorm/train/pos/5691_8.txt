i was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theaters, however, i wasn't able to get around to it. so, finally, it hit the shelves, and i picked it up. not knowing exactly what to expect, i plopped the dvd in the player, settled in the for an evening of murder, and pressed play. what followed was one of the more engaging flicks i've seen in the last couple years.<br /><br />*some spoilers*<br /><br />this is the story of the wonderland murders, which led to the seediest parts of la and straight to the biggest porn start of the 70's, john holmes (val kilmer).<br /><br />i was hooked from the beginning, and the feel of the movie held me all the way until the very bloody end. i was surprised to find that the movie focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation after. aside from a few blood splattered walls in the beginning, and the actual showing of the murders towards the end, the movie was more or less an engaging show of great dialoge and great acting. val kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star, and even the "beautiful but that's it" bosworth was a joy to watch (and just for her looks, mind you)<br /><br />i personally felt the best aspect of the movie was, as i mentioned, its lack of outright showing the murders. it was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you couldn't completely see the brutal bludgeoning bestowed apon the sleeping foursome. furthermore, the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to whet my appetite. they were being beating with lead pipes, there's not much more that needs to be said.<br /><br />my only real problem was carrie fisher's brief appearence. her portrayal of the overly-religious figure was, i think, a bit too cliche of her appearence. maybe that person was actually part of the story, maybe not, but i wasn't sold, and for some reason, fisher seemed a bit too "akward" in her portrayal.<br /><br />overall, an excellent movie worth the watch, even if once!<br /><br />***8/10***
