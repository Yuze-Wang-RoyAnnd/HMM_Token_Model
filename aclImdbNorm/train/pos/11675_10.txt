i always follow the dakar, so when my husband bought charlie's 'race to dakar' dvd home i couldn't wait to watch it! of course we'd seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on, but that never gives the background and specific teams.<br /><br />if you watched long way round then you won't be surprised by the language which frankly i find more amusing than offensive.<br /><br />i think the only thing that annoyed me about the dvd was charlie's hair, but he had it styled before dakar so my feminine need for neatness was assuaged; tho' i could have lived without the 'flame' undies lol as with lwr, the preparation was every bit as interesting as the race itself. i nearly cried when charlie broke his hand, and winced at every bruise he sustained while training....and of course the death of andy caldicott...that was an appalling tragedy, but then every year there's something.<br /><br />russ drives me nuts, although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative cynic he was in lwr. it's great to see him get along so well now with charlie.<br /><br />what i learned from this odyssey was - 1. never let scorpion prepare your vehicle for anything! - they had months to prepare the x5, and still the day before the team left for lisbon, scorpion had only done half of things that needed to be done, and the vehicle was a pain throughout the whole race; 2. the dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their rider/driver retrieval plan - leaving matt (and presumably a large number of other riders/drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of culpable negligence; 3. charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for 'rough and tough' adventure but needs to toughen up a lot to really perform as he'd like; and finally, 4. charlie and ewan are planning another of these epos called the long way down in 2007, and i can't wait to get my hands on it! :d if you love bikes and/or genuinely nice blokes 'having a go', you have to watch this, i guarantee you love it. it's very entertaining.<br /><br />in conclusion, to simon pavey - you sir are a hero, i was so impressed by the your 'quiet achiever' manner and the fact that you actually finished.....just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is. and to charlie, matt and the rest of the team - full marks for pulling it off. to think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable. you're all wonderful.
