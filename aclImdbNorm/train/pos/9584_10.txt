yeah this films is tops. cant recommend it more. gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film. very funny, sad and interesting. never dull. great access. a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter. some of the performances and just amazing. if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching. great. 10 out of 10. i got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching. the interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy- weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto. the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement. cool. track it down.
