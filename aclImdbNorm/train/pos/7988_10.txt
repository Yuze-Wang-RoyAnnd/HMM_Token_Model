i get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies, and they were not disappointed when i watched this one. i cried numerous times but believe me it was not over sappiness. i ached for the family and i ached for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how. denzel was fabulous as always, and so was chris walkin. mickey rourke, i did not even recognized though; the years have not been kind to him. my husband is not one to re-watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies(snore!!!!) he has watched this movie 5 times now and i am going to have to get the dvd to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time i was watching.
