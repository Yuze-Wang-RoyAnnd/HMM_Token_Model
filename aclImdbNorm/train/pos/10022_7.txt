aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the 70's. also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women, and then he set them on fire).<br /><br />this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts.<br /><br />"aro tolbukhin" is a serious work, so analytical, it's not morbid at all. such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster.<br /><br />*my rate: 7/10
