it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about.the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate. the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this: a plot to kill the president of the united states. michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed.kiefer sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine. one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president,it also concerns a mole(traitor) in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction.
