the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever. powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30's, and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells. they are extremely fun to watch, so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold. eric blore also has some comic turns as powell's butler.<br /><br />powell's contract with mgm included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio, but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script, so he eagerly accepted the assignment. they had worked together in two 1929 paramount films, the canary murder case and the greene murder case, both in the philo vance series.
