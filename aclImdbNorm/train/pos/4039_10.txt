most complaints i've heard of this film really come down to one thing: it isn't versus. yes, the cast and crew is basically the same. yes, kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film's second half, but that's about where the similarities end. versus takes place essentially all outside, showcasing kitamura's ability to craft an interesting b-movie in natural locations. for alive, almost everything takes place inside. in small, cramped spaces. here the art design is thrust into your face, and what art design it is! we are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces. also a key difference is that we don't get much action here until the end of the film. versus was all about action and cool, here a lot more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind. because of this, alive is a far more interesting film than versus. you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed, but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters.<br /><br />i'm now ecstatic that i ordered the dvd despite some naysay. you should too! but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus - it's often slow, and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it. i hope media blasters picks it up for subtitled r1 dvd release!
