as one other imdb reviewer has remarked, this movie starts a bit slow, but gets considerably better as it goes along. yes, it is released by roger corman, and yes, it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy. however, the juxtapositioning of the wife's career as a rising blues singer against the husband's gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical "void" or "hole" while she's away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done. utilizing a very small number of locations and characters, and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout, this movie, though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget, reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario, namely the french film "swimming pool" which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from "up against amanda." with a smaller tool set, up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary, fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations, but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre. the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past (again, very freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amanda's plight this aspect of the story elicits. the cast is excellent i think.<br /><br />
