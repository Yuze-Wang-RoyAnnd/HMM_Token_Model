this cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually stunning piece of work. there will be very, very minor spoilers: <br /><br />this short has a "story" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. that's pretty much the plot, such as it is. but this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. the visuals are exceptional. back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here.<br /><br />my favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. at more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />the visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed. these types of shorts were things which hugh harman and rudolf ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from mgm, because this cartoon probably went over budget and mgm finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than harman and ising were.<br /><br />this is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing. it's available on the dvd attack of the '30s characters. recommended, particularly if you like good animation.
