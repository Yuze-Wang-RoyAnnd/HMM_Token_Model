this might contain a spoiler, so beware.<br /><br />if it had been 200,000 thousand or two million people, does it make a difference? sometimes i get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number of (strangely very loud) americans, but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not bred or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone. god help us for what we have done. after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans, and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving a race, you would think we'd have grown hearts and souls in the late 60's and early 70's. but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are justified to only us. how then, can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will? we are contradictory and hypocritical, and i am ashamed for this. i feel sorrow for the people affected. they deserve justice and their homes back. if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety, i don't want it. i denounce these actions, and hope our global community understands that many americans believe the american government is a runaway train of deceit. no one is above the law. i want my country back, and so do the chagos islanders. regardless of what people post from the anonymity of their computers, no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bombs and heliports. we can't stand to be stuck in traffic, let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our homes. 'not one of us, brit and american alike forget what goes around comes around. don't buy into the fallacy that a simpler, more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their rights observed, and preserved - when we turn our backs on the basic human rights and dignities of 2000, we turn away from the basic human rights and dignities of all men.
