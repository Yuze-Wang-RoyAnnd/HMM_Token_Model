"kalifornia" is a good hollywoodish odyssey of suspense and terror which tells of two couples who drive cross-country to california to share the cost of gas: a pair of losers (lewis & pitt) and two wannabee artists, a photographer and a writer (duchovny & forbes). pitt "nails" his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller. a good watch for those into psycho-killer flix.
