after mistaking a halloween re-broadcast of orson welles' classic radio adaptation of war of the worlds for a real martian invasion, a group of moronic martians shows up on earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.<br /><br />this really is often quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. it will most likely appeal to sci-fi fans. this has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than i expected it to be. despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest martian invasion ever put to film. interestingly enough, the martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic action hero/sci-fi hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). fun for the whole family. <br /><br />"prepare to die! earth scum!"
