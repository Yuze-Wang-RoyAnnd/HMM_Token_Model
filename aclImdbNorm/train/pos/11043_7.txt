malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere. nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest. soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell. from here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison. that leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light.<br /><br />honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together. anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast. the kills are raw and eerie... its doesn't take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in hellraiser. malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint. at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger... when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal, so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be? with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do. i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale. several elements like the visitor with the camera, the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don't fit tight in the story. anyway, i'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director valette, although its a turn-off to see he's is doing a hollywood remake of "one missed call" which was worn off and useless already in the miike-version.
