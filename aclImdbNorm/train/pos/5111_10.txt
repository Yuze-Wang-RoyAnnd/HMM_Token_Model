does anyone know what kind of pickup john t drove? i looks like a mid to late 70's ford. this movie is my favorite as well as my wife's. it was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. the pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck i drove and recently found another like it. i would like to restore the pick up i have to resemble the on in the movie. also the music was awesome, and the acting was great. where and what is the lady who portrayed john's aunt? also did john have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? also what year of mustang did debra w drive in this show. it looked like a 60's model. thanks,
