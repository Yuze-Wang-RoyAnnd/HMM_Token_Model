the critics are dumb. this movie is funny and smart. i loved this movie a lot. why does everyone hate this movie so much. i wish people would love this movie more than they don't. ben stiller and jack black are true comedians and they put through a lot of work to make this movie. i don't see you people out there making movies like them. so people should just watch it and not comment it. i like this movie. it is ok through it all. there are parts were it get's dumb but at least they made it. jerry stiller would love this because this movie has the acting just like the show king of queens. but this is better than that. i can't believe this was rated so low.
