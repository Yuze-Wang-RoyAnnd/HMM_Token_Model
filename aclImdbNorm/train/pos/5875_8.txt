these are one of the movies that don't require any brain or thinking, it's a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so. i was really surprised with john abraham's acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless face,so from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfully,by managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as paresh rawal and akshaye kumar. i was also quite surprised with the akshaye's 3 girls because there roles don't require much talent but mostly moaning about akshaye's dissapearence(to the other girls) i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing ,also majority of songs are good,it is colourful and fun so on a boring sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood.
