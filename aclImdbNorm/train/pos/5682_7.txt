no, this is not no alice fairy tale my friends! this `wonderland' fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody wonderland murders that occurred back in 80's california. at the center of this bloodbath was no other than `johnny wad' himself. yes, john holmes! daddy ding-dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine. besides being a legendary adult film actor, holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various hollywood junkies. val kilmer was occasionally majestic as holmes, but for once this holmes character did not milk it through completely. the film possesses a `who's who' of supporting players: josh lucas & dylan mcdermott as hollywood riffraffs , kate bosworth & lisa kudrow as the women in holmes life, and eric bogosian as a menacing tinsletown entrepreneur. these characters do play integral parts, directly or indirectly, in the `wonderland' murders. out of this support group, it was josh lucas who was the most fierce & impressive as the ardent ron launius. lucas is gradually escalating into a major hollywood player with such charismatic turns in `a beautiful mind' & `sweet home alabama'. director james cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes, just like holmes' famous organ. holmes was eventually acquitted of the `wonderland' murders. he died of complications from the aids virus. `wonderland' will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night, and if holmes really laid out his weapon. oops! wrong holmes movie! ok! that is enough before i get `penislized' i mean penalized. bye holmies! *** average
