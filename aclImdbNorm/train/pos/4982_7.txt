i love these "diaper baby" movies! you couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history. it is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh, which it does. how they ever got these kids to "act" i'll never know. i think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naivet'e that existed in the early 30's. you have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. the fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. it was a different time with a totally different mind set.
