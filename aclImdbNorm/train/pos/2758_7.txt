this film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with down syndrome.<br /><br />the character development in this film is excellent. we get to believe that harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and georges is an innocent man who craves loving and care from the "normal" society. acting is excellent, and the cannes best actor award is well deserved.<br /><br />the fantasy scenes in the film highlights the fact that georges misery towards his abandonment by his family, and his desire to be treated like a normal person. the song that gets played repeatedly also reinforces this message. the film shows that people who are mentally handicapped are good natured. we have been treating them with discrimination and neglect, a fact that is highlighted by the scene where georges gives a present to the waitress in the kitchen). if we get to understand and share these people's world, both we and the mentally handicapped can become very happy.<br /><br />i was so drawn into the film and the characters' emotional experiences. it is a touching film for good natured souls.
