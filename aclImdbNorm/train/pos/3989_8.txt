"the mother" tells of a recently widowed mid-60's mother of two adult children (reid) who, on the heels of her husband's death, finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover. the film dwells on the quietly passive mom, her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter, the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover, and the convolutions arising therefrom. a somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents, "the mother" does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism. will play best with more mature audiences, possibly women, who may better empathize with the central character, her needs and issues.
