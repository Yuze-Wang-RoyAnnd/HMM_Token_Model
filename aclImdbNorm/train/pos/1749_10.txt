steve carrel proves himself to be a great leading man in this wonderful, original, raunchy breath of fresh air. i about wet myself at how geniusly hilarious it was.<br /><br />basically the movie's title says it all: andy stitzer is a 40 year- old male who works at an electronics store. he is a bit of a nerd who loves videogames and comics, and has the biggest collection. his peers that work in the store with him find out that he's a virgin during a rather sex dialogue filled poker game, and then andy has to go through a rather funny as hell odyessy of rude sexual awakenings, but always screwing up which leads to him not losing his virginity, but he eventually gets lucky in the very end.<br /><br />leave the little ones at home, but take the entire family to see this awesome romantic adult comedy. it will have you hooked and cracking up from the very beginning, and by the time it is over, you will be wishing you wore your extra thick absorbent undergarments. only other thing i can say about it is too bad steve carrel wasn't recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago. he is definitely gonna win best breakthrough male performance in next years mtv movie awards. you can bet your hard earned dollar on that, people!<br /><br />i give this one a perfect 10!
