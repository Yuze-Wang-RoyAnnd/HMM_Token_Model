it's really unfortunate that most people outside of canada think that the only things that canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. this film is the second superlative canadian film i have seen within the past few weeks (the first was "the red violin"), far better than all but the best hollywood efforts.<br /><br />gustad noble is anything but that; he is a middle-aged parsi bank employee in bombay in the 1970s. this film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. at the same time, it is a fascinating, and, i would assume, accurate, portrayal of middle-class, urban life in india at the time.<br /><br />however, i was somewhat prepared for this, having read rohinton mistry's book a few years ago. the film, as might be expected, cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but, if you want to read a really good book, and see a really good film, read and see "such a long journey".
