this film captured my heart from the very beginning, when hearing quincy jones' first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows. this is truly a film to cry and die for...! the whole cast gives the best performance in a film i've seen in years and spielberg has really outdone himself! whoppi goldberg, margaret avery, oprah winfrey(oh lord!), danny glover, and the others, all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! goldberg is celie, she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong together with her, throughout the movie, and we triumph with her. margaret avery is wonderful as shug avery, even when she's at her most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners", indeed, "have souls too". the always sympathetic, charming danny glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music of(i'd say sir)quincy jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film! the photography, the music, the director and the music makes this beautiful, soulful movie into an experience of life. you don't want to miss it! "sista'...remember my name..."
