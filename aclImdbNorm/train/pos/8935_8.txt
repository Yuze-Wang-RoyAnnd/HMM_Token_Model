"the intruder (l'intrus)" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. <br /><br />grizzled michel subor plays "louis trebor" like jason bourne as an old man with a hidden past, living simply in an isolated hut in the woods for justifiably paranoid reasons (but attracting pretty young women who can be useful to him). we learn more about him through dreams, flashbacks and a journey that may unfold chronologically or not, as well as through his brusque interactions with family, lovers, business associates and a striking nemesis. like "the limey," the film resonates with parent/child regrets and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man (here paul g'egauff's 1965 adventure film "le reflux").<br /><br />in a complete contrast of moods, we meet his son sidney (gr'egoire colin) who has to be the sexiest house husband in the world, as he sweetly and seductively does household repairs and cares for a baby, a toddler and every need of his working wife. surely director/co-writer claire denis must have created him as a woman's fantasy if ever there was one and a lesson to other filmmakers on filming foreplay. there's an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pouch. he is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of sustaining; no wonder he thinks his father is "a lunatic." i spent the rest of the film in dread that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of the heart of his alienated father is very gradually played out before our eyes.<br /><br />the film is a puzzle, but subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we watch him traverse countries and negotiate nefarious deals, and the voice-over narration for denis's "beau travail" was annoying anyway. we have to figure out from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to geneva, korea and the south pacific. time passing is indicated by the seasons changing and scars being created and healing. there are lots of images of water for cleansing and for distancing. <br /><br />continuing her fascination with the morphing of colonialism into globalization, as well as playing a bit on stereotypes of the mysterious orient and russian criminals, denis has incorporated elements from robert louis stevenson, paul gauguin and marlon brando's tahiti idylls and a 40-page memoir by french philosopher jean-luc nancy, the last for the title and heart-transplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited immortality which does have consequences.<br /><br />while "louis" thinks he's succeeded in being above boundaries, rules and morals, there is some amusement in the last act as the locals don't quite know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey, even as he again lies in isolation.<br /><br />several people in the audience left in frustration at the elliptical, but strikingly beautiful, story telling method. the unconventional narrative does raise a lot of plot questions on details.
