saw this film in august at the 27th annual national association of black journalists convention in milwaukee, wi, it's first public screening. the film is great!!! derek luke is wonderful as antwone fisher. this young actor has a very bright future. the real antwone fisher did a great job writing the film and denzel's direction is right on the money. see it opening weekend. you won't be disappointed.
