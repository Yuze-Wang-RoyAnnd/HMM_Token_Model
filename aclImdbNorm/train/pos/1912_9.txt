i'll keep it short and brief, the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius, the actors are just perfect for the roles they play (cj's character is legendary) and they have so much chemistry on screen which makes it what it is, a very successful comedy.<br /><br />when i saw first saw the new episodes which is probably going back just over 6/7 months, i wondered what had happened to paul. i was gutted to find out that he had died when i browsed google. he was so funny and played his character to perfection, an over-protective dad, who likes to keep his daughters out of the limelight and away from boys.<br /><br />the comedy, i think, has gone from strength to strength, even without paul in it.<br /><br />plus, i think most people would enjoy this watching it.
