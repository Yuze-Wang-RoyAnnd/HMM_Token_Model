now this is what i'd call a good horror. with occult/supernatural undertones, this nice low-budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene. this proves you don't need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie.<br /><br />the plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) become gradually more interesting, as the movie builds up tension to the finale. most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere, who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates.<br /><br />i won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen. there a few flaws though: the fx are not that good, but they're used effectively; the plot leaves some mysteries open; and things get very confusing towards the end, but malefique redeems itself by the time it's over.<br /><br />i thought his was a very good movie, 8/10
