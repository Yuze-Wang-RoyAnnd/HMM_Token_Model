i have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie. the visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore i loved how this move was unlike crouching tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close.<br /><br />i think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. the mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of mahayana buddhist text (mahayana buddhism can be found in china, korea and japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... gojoe has the action, story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer. i strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the u.s. my one complaint is in the last fight scene (i can't give anything away--sorry).
