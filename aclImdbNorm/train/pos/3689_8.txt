just saw this tonight at a seminar on digital projection (shot on 35mm, and first feature film fully scanned in 6k mastered in 4k, and projected with 2k projector at etc/usc theater in hwd)..so much for tech stuff. 18 directors (including alexander payne, wes cravens, joel and ethan coen, gus van sant, walter salles and gerard depardieu, among several good french/ international directors) were each given 5 minutes to make a love story. they come in all shapes and forms, with known actors(elijah wood, natalie portman, steve buscemi ..totally hilarious..., maggie glyllenhall, nick nolte, geena rowlands ..soo good..and she actually wrote the piece she was in, msr depardieu and many good international actors as well. the stories vary from all out romance to quirky comedy to alex payne's touching study of a woman discovering herself to van sant and one of those things that happens anywhere..maybe? nothing really off putting by having french spoken in most sequences (with english subtitles) and a small amount of actual english spoken, though that will probably relegate it to art houses (a la diva.) also only one piece that might be considered "experimental" but colorful and funny as well, the rest simple studies of sometimes complex relationships. all easy to follow (unless the "experimental" one irritates your desire for a formulaic story. several brought up some emotions for me...i admit i am affected by love in cinema...when it is presented in something other than sentimentality. i even laughed at a mime piece, like no other i have seen (thank you for that!) the film hit its peak, for me, somewhere around a little more than half way through, then the last two sequences picked up again. some beautiful shots of paris at night, lush romantic kind of music, usually used to good effect, not just schmaltz for "emotions" in sound, generally good cinematography, though some shots seemed soft focus when it couldn't have meant to have been (main character in shot/scene). pacing of each film was good, and overall structure, though a bit long (they left out two of what was to be 20 films, but said all would be on the dvd) seemed to vary between tones of the films to keep a good balance. not sure when it comes out, but a good study of how to make a 5 min film work..and sometimes, what doesn't work (if it covers too much time, emotionally, for a short film.) should be in region one when released, but they didn't know when.
