first of all, we know that bruce willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. the story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. the story seems to go towards sf but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. about that. movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. but that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. as far as the direction goes, it is prefect. movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. so, if you are getting ready to see a sci-fi movie or some action, you'll miss it. b there should be more movies like this.
