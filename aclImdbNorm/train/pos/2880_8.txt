"cinderella" is one of the most beloved of all disney classics. and it really deserves its status. based on the classic fairy-tale as told by charles perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters. when a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the king wants to get the prince to marry), cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. but there is a fairy godmother on hand...<br /><br />the story of "cinderella" on its own wouldn't be able to pad out a feature, so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the fairy godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become cinderella's true sidekicks. the mice jaq and gus are the main sidekicks, and their own nemesis being the stepmother's cat lucifer. their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy-tale plot, and are for the most part wonderful. admittedly, the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since "cinderella" is the most worn down story of all time, probably) ends up as one of the most involving disney stories.<br /><br />the animation and art direction is lovely. all of the legendary nine old men animated on this picture, and mary blair's colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for "alice in wonderland", "peter pan", "the three caballeros" and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen. the colours and designs are lovely, especially in the fairy godmother and ball scenes, as well as in those pretty little moments here and there.<br /><br />overall, "cinderella" ranks as one of the best disney fairy-tales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the disney philosophy that dreams really can come true.
