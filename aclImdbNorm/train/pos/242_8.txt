i thought that this film was very well made, heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless. orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable. how true it is to what really happened i have no idea, but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do. maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought? in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film. all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didn't do better in the cinemas.
