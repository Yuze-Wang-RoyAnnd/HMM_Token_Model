the first time i saw this "film" i loved it. when i was 11, i was more interested in the music and dancing. as i've grown older, i've become more interested in the acting as well. while the first half is just a retrospective of michael's career (from the jackson 5 up to "bad"), it was still entertaining to watch. the "badder" sequence could've been left out, though the kids were pretty good. "speed demon" and "leave me alone" were funny, especially when the police officer tells michael, "i need your autograph right here", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. but it's "smooth criminal" that's the icing on the cake. joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie (and that hair was wild). the dancing is perfect, and so are the special effects. the only thing i could have done without was the spiders. any fan of michael's should see this, if you haven't already. i give it a 10+!
