there seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net. those who hate it and curse ralph bakshis name and those love it and call it work of genious. i'm inclined to be in the middle. i'am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film (e.g.the cruel cutting of the story, badly rotoscoped charecters, over acting etc...) but dispite this i still love this film. the rotoscoping (when done properly)adds an eerie lifelike dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic. the surrealistic scenes when the nineriders chase frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score... magic. sadly the bad points outweight film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great film.<br /><br />(no doubt i'll be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review, ah well, such is life)
