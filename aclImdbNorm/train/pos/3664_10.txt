picture the scene: a mountainous alien landscape. twin moons illuminate the blood red sky. the tardis lands, and out steps the doctor, a middle-aged man in a victorian frock coat, and rose, his companion from earth. a flicker of recognition crosses his face. "well, i never! its the planet saurious-7. where i fought the warlike kraggartians. they tried to use giant skinkons to take over the planet.". the girl sniffs the air. "can't we go, doctor. i don't like the look of this place. i keep thinking we're being watched.". the doctor wags a disapproving finger. "don't be silly, girl. i wonder if the king and queen of cordaraby city remember me from my last visit. come along, rose, come along!". he strides off, the girl struggles to keep up. high on a hill, sinister red eyes regard them with hatred... <br /><br />that was not how 'rose' began back in 2005, and thank heavens for that say i. unfairly derided at the time of its original u.k. broadcast, 'rose' can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode, putting 'dr.who' back where it belonged, as one of the b.b.c.'s flagship programmes. the mistakes made by the mcgann t.v. movie were well learnt. instead of trying to shoehorn the new 'who' into existing chronology, it represented a fresh start for the series, beginning with shop girl rose tyler ( billie piper ) going about her daily routine. one day she goes to the basement to find a man named wilson, and then the trouble begins. mannequins come to life and attack her. it is only through the intervention of a mysterious stranger ( christopher eccleston ) that she is saved. <br /><br />the story, slight though it may be, is more than adequate as a starting-point for the series. the autons are, of course, an old villain ( this was their first appearance since 1971 ), but no references are made to their past appearances - another wise move. the finale effectively recreated the famous scene in 'spearhead from space' when shop window dummies sprang to life. as the doctor, christopher eccleston lacked the eccentricity of his predecessors, preferring a modern leather jacket to the doctor's traditional period clothes, but this made him more accessible to the show's hoped-for new audience. billie piper confounded her critics by making a big impression as 'rose'. also good was noel clarke as her boyfriend 'mickey'.<br /><br />yes, there was an added emphasis on special effects, but then there needed to be - the wobbly sets and unconvincing monsters of the past have no place on 21st century television. what is more important is how good a script this is. ten million people tuned in to see the new doctor.<br /><br />'dr.who' was back - and back with a bang!
