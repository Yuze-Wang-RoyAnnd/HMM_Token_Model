okay. this movie is a pure pleasure. it has the ever so violent horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy. the dentist really starts to loose his mind and it's enjoyable to watch him do so. this movie is for certain people, though. either you'll completely love it or you will totally hate it. a good movie to rent and watch when you don't got anything else to do. also recommended: psycho iii
