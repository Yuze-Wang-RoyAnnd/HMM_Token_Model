this is what the musical genre was made of. humor, talent, romance, and action all rolled into one.<br /><br />frank sinatra was wonderful. nothing else needs to be said. marlon brando, although not a singer, did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of sky masterson. the fact that he couldn't sing added to his character. the ladies in the film were alright, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show.<br /><br />it is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age. it connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh.<br /><br />definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed!
