director vincenzo natali's cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which, although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration, manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience.<br /><br />morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), a stay-at-home husband with an overbearing wife, decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high-tech company digi corp. his job is to travel to conferences across the country (under the assumed identity of jack thursby) and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses, via a nifty little electronic pen-gizmo.<br /><br />in reality, however, the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities. morgan, along with his fellow conference attendees, is being brainwashed. the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma, during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities. once they are totally convinced that they are someone else, they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies, where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion.<br /><br />but digi corp's plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative-for-hire rita foster (lucy liu), who opens morgan's eyes to what is really happening. she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques. she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby, then he will be 'eliminated'. morgan plays along, and applies for a job at rival business sunways.<br /><br />however, arriving at his new workplace, he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy. fortunately, the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent.<br /><br />from hereon in, things get progressively more complicated; the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone. in an exciting finale, all eventually becomes clear (but only if you've been following events very carefully).<br /><br />director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget. he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast; jeremy northam,in particular, is fantastic
