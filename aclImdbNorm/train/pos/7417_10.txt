this beautiful story of an elder son coming home, and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from, is poignant and moving. it shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the western world, with a sense of family that we have lost. the story is beautiful, sad, and at times funny and comic. it has a feeling of realism that we don't seem to see any longer in our western movies.<br /><br />the acting is unusual, in that as the movie progresses, it almost gives the impression that it is not acting, but a documentary of ordinary people. this is brilliant directing and movie making.<br /><br />would love to see more movies by this director.
