out of these pokemon films (which are in order of best to least for me): pokemon the first movie, pokemon 4ever, pokemon heroes, pokemon 200 and pokemon: entei and the unknown, this is probably the one most concerning the environment, arguably the most beautiful and the most calming one. whether these are good points for you or not, "pokemon 4ever," still has entertained many.<br /><br />as well as the three points covered above, this pokemon film includes good humour and good cgi (as well as anime). the time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and team rocket (the comic reliefs/rubbish baddies) end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than sidekicks. <br /><br />the flaws are, as always, the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting, even more so than a few pokemon film baddies. <br /><br />a strange pokemon is being tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest. a young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere...<br /><br />meanwhile, ash, brock and misty are entering a large forest...<br /><br />curious? watch the rest...<br /><br />good for all pokemon fans and "american" anime movie fans, enjoy "pokemon 4ever"! :-)
