absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. i have seen it at least a hundred times and i can't go through it without crying. i defy anyone to watch the reunion of celie and nettie, or shug and father and not feel your eyes getting misty. whoopie goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal. and for the person who said you can't love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! im a testament to that.
