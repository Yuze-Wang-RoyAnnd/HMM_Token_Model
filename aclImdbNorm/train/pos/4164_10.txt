those childhood memories...when things were new, and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us; as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life.<br /><br />one of the initial memories i have from childhood is this animated program "galaxy express 999," about a young boy named tetsuro, who goes on a train ride around the galaxy, in the hopes of gaining a mechanical body in order to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold-hearted, trophy gathering mechanical hunters. accompanying tetsuro on his journey is maetel, a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost all those years ago...<br /><br />back in the early-80's, as a boy who attended kindergarten and the early years of elementary school in seoul, south korea, "galaxy express 999" was a phenomenally popular animated program imported from japan, which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and exciting journey through life that awaited them. the memories of tuning into this animated program on weekdays between 8 to 9pm before bed time...<br /><br />those were some wonderful memories, never to be had again...<br /><br />as i moved to america, and while residing here for over 2 decades, i sometimes wondered about that time and place, in a country thousands of miles away divided from america by an enormously vast ocean, of this childhood program, with its hit theme song, and of the boy named tetsuro, his protective companion maetel, the enigmatic train conductor, and of the spacefaring train galaxy express 999.<br /><br />many, many years passed...<br /><br />last summer while i was in korea, i was able to track down a copy of the original "galaxy express 999" (1979) on dvd, and it brought back a lot of nostalgic, heartfelt memories. "galaxy express 999" remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago, opening up those nostalgic memories of new discoveries, an important stepping stone for young boys who tuned in and embarked on their life's journey into manhood.<br /><br />here's to wonderful memories. "good-bye, maetel. good-bye, galaxy express 999...<br /><br />good-bye, to my childhood."<br /><br />10/10
