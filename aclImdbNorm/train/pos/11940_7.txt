as a baseball die-hard, this movie goes contrary to what i expect in a sports movie: authentic-looking sports action, believable characters, and an original story line. while "angels in the outfield" fails miserably in the first category, it succeeds beautifully in the latter two. "angels" weaves the story of roger and j.p., two anaheim foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family, with that of the woebegone angels franchise, struggling to draw fans and win games. pushed by his deadbeat father's promise that they would be a family only when the angels win the pennant, roger asks for some heavenly help, and gets it in the form of diamond-dwelling spirits bent on reversing the franchise's downward spiral. and, when short-fused manager george knox (portrayed by danny glover) begins believing in what roger sees, the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around--and roger and j.p. find something to believe in. glover in particular gives a nice performance, and tony danza, playing a washed-up pitcher, also does well, despite clearly having zero idea of how to pitch out of the windup!
