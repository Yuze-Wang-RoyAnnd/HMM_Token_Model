i really love this movie, saw it again last week after 3 years or so. this movie is perfect, great acting, great story, great directing/camera-work/music. it is a gift to show it to someone you love. too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this one. top 5 work. really!!<br /><br />today, it's 3 years and 3 days later then the comment above. it was never posted because it was not more than 10 lines. anyway, i saw "le huitieme jour" again yesterday. this is with no doubt in my movie top 3. together with "cinema paradiso" which is also a masterpiece. the soundtrack is also really good. i am really curious about "jaco von dormael's" new movie. i hope it will complete my movie top 3. if you see this movie, rent it. or even better. buy it. because you will want to see it again.
