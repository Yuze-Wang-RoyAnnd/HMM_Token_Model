i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time, and i was really excited about seeing it, and when i heard that george c. scott was in it, i was really excited, because i really love george c. scott! when me and my class were watching this movie, i was really into it, and when it was over, i was really impressed, i thought that it was totally fabulous! this is the best version of charles dickens' classic novel that i have seen so far! george c. scott's performance as scrooge is something else, i thought that he was the perfect choice, he was scrooge, he is the definitive scrooge! i've seen two different versions of a christmas carol, the other is the one with patrick stewart, but this is the better one! <br /><br />what it really great about this is the acting, i thought that the actors were fabulous, everyone was, the spirits, tiny tim, bob cratchit, everyone, they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts! but the best part of the movie was george c. scott! when i saw him, i thought that he was the absolute best! he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge, i do not think that they could have found someone better! i don't think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie! <br /><br />this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens, and i really think that you will agree, you will think that this movie is fabulous! i am probably going to have to buy this movie on dvd, because i thought that it was totally fabulous! i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece! this is the best version of a christmas carol, period. <br /><br />10/10
