if you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation...oh well..but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic, you will love it..jim carey was incredible as usual. the story line was great, a few parts added like the history of the grinch made it even better. ron howard never misses a beat..but although there were a few adult comments and cleavage added, this is supped to be a kids or family show. try not to lose sight of that ..if you do you really wont enjoy the movie...and as for the comments about ron howard, try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do..its not easy as it looks ...
