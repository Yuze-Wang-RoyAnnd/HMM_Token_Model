spoilers sex huh? it's one of the most basic parts of human life. yet, do we ever take it too seriously? people always want more, even those who get it on a daily basis, and if you are unlucky, there are potential life changing (creating) consequences. ironically people claim we are all starting to have sex at a younger and younger age (despite victorians getting married and having children in their early teens), so it must be increasingly difficult for those who get to a point as virgins. in steve carell's first big screen lead, he plays a man who has gotten to 40 without managing it. treating us to countless lude and extreme sex related incidents, not to mention more profanity than an episode of "eurotrash", the general plot of the film and it's principle doesn't sound funny. it's a pleasant surprise therefore that for all the inappropriate, failed jokes, there are an incredibly large number of ones which hit the mark and leave the audience in hysterics.<br /><br />andy stitzer (carell) is a nice guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament. at the same time though, he blatantly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member, andy's friends discover his secret. at the age of 40, andy is still a virgin. now, for multiple reasons, but mostly pity, the three men (paul rudd, seth rogen and romany malco) all offer andy advice with one goal in mind. to put him out of his misery and get him laid.<br /><br />one of the few good things about "anchorman", it was only going to be a matter of time before steve carell got himself a lead of his own. impressively, in "the 40 year old virgin" he doesn't disappoint. showing the hopeless, shy virgin to perfection, carell is a revelation as he gradually grows increasingly confident as the advice begins to help.<br /><br />carell is not alone however in his performance. rudd, rogen, malco and catherine keener as the love interest are all superb. rudd is a personal favourite as the love sick david who falls apart at multiple times and shares the finest scene with rogen as the two argue over homosexuality.<br /><br />the biggest surprise about this film is not the way that so many of the jokes hit the mark, but actually the clever way that it flips the message on it's head. obviously designed for conservative america, the film's entire tone evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest into one of safe sex and abstinence. the virgin doesn't need sex to make his life complete, he just needs confidence and true love. a worthy message to preach, and a considerable improvement on the one you expect to see at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />it's weird to see a crude comedy which is consistently funny and well acted, but low and behold, "40 year old virgin" is just that. throw in a well meaning message too and you're well on the way to a top class comedy. a surprising joy.
