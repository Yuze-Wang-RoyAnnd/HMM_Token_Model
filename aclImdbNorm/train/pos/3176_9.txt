i happened to catch this film at a screening in brooklyn - it's difficult to describe the plot; it has a lot of wacky characters, but let's just say i'd have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh the hardest, i wouldn't know where to begin. even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted.<br /><br />there are numerous small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable, it has a few "devices" that pop up and add another hilarious layer. it is refreshing to watch; not some recycled stuff i'd seen many times before. if this film could reach a wider audience, i'm certain it would be a real crowd-pleaser, the story is so original and heartfelt.<br /><br />there's a lot here to like, funny back-stories, mishaps and misunderstandings which set up the final act and dramatic conclusion. cross eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart; it's a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout. definitely worth seeing!
