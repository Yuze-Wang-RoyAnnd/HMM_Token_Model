what a fun movie! if you're a giallo fan, red queen kills 7 times is a real winner. to begin with, it's hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo. both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life. the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy. one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start. the killer, the red queen, is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers i've seen in an italian movie. the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful. in fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film. the convoluted plot held my interest throughout. finally, bruno nicolai's score may be the best i've heard from the composer. the main theme is so memorable i haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days.<br /><br />the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the film's finale. first, the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot. if you've seen more than a couple gialli, you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings. second, the ending feels a little too rushed and, as a result, is a bit confusing. i'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me, but i'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all. a second viewing might just clear this up.
