gregory peck gives a brilliant performance in this film. the last 15 minutes (or thereabouts) are great and peck is an absolute joy to watch. the same cannot however be said for the rest of the film. it's not awful and i'm sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason (if i were to be honest) to see it is peck. for the rest you are better off just reading the old testament.
