sure it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! but the story was just so weak. and the portrayal of lincoln was even weaker. not that henry fonda wasn't good but the character he played was nothing but a loon. do you mean to tell me that lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court. i mean who the hell was he supposed to be? cousin vinnie? i mean come on, "i'll just call you jackass then"???? i understand that ford was going for great funny hero guy but i didn't really like this guy at all. he cheats in sports, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom. how am i supposed to take this seriously.<br /><br />the twist was even weaker. i mean come on! that was just stupid. the whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams. saying that i liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so i can't say it's a bad film. in fact i must say that i must say it's good enough, nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad but this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that i can't understand how anyone could consider it great.<br /><br />i have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true i would really have to shake my head.
