another downey must-see! if you are an obsessed fan like me, you have got to see this movie! he plays alex finch, a 22 year old yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier. alex is the re-incarnation of louie jeffries, a no-nonsense lawyer happily married to corrine (cybil sheppard). louie is killed on their one-year anniversary when he is hit by a car. he demands to go back, only this time in the body of alex finch. enter robert downey jr., a lot of confusion, and a lot of laughs.<br /><br />although this movie is 15-years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re-incarnation. and if so, how often to you meet the same souls life after life. i don't know the answer. but i do know that you need to see this movie. it is a riot, and downey looks so good in a tuxedo. this film makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. it just gets recycled.
