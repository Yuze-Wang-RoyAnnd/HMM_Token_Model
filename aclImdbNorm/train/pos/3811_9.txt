for a long time i haven't seen so beautiful animated feature. having healthy respect for pixar, i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by 'em can not be compared to this. animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. the graphics is amazing, the background surroundings are mind-blowing, almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly. sometimes i felt tingles down my spine - so much i loved what i've seen.<br /><br />the plot is absolutely romantic. as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be. the characters are lovable, especially hector, the blue rabbit, he owns, pawns, rocks and rules! the other char-s are very nice also. the humor is top-notch.<br /><br />generally it seemed that creators didn't invest much effort into this. i mean it looked like it didn't take em too much in difference from people of pixar&dreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new. and i'm very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great. they've made a magnificent, touching movie, a candy for eye and heart.<br /><br />the only minus is stupid beginning and that's why it's 9of10 not 10/10
