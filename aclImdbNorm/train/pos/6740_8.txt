the fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie, that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique for its time, 1950. <br /><br />along with the haunting music and the well written plot, the film is a prime example of film noir at its best. close-ups of dana's eyes reveal the anguish within, karl malden excels as his boss, who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct. <br /><br />otto preminger made this type of movie just about his own. if there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of gene tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop. their scenes in the cafe, however, are wonderful and ring true. <br /><br />tom tully, in the bit part of her father is perfect as is gary merrill as the hood. great lighting and mood setting. the building where the deadly deeds take place highly atmospheric, i love the old woman in the basement. <br /><br />8 out of 10.
