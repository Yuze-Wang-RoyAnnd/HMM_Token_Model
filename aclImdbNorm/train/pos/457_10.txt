this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i can't get it out of my head. i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done, and these four are excellent in their endeavors. some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we'd never be able to do it in real life. i always learn something from the shows. but if you like mystery, drama, comedy, and a little forensic work you'll love this show. it reminds me of quincy, me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and inter-react with each other. they screw up a lot but they get the job done, and that's what counts.
