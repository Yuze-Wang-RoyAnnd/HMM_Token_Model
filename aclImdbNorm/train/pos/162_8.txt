for a "no budget" movie this thing rocks. i don't know if america's gonna like it, but we were laughing all the way through. some really funny funny stuff. really non-hollywood.<br /><br />the actors and music rocked. the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up. whooo whooo!<br /><br />i've seen some of the actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them i think i've seen in commercials or in something somewhere. basically it rocked! luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors.
