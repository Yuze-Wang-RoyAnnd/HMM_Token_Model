i'm going to review the 2 films as a whole because i feel that is how it should be considered, and watched. when i talk about 'the film' i am talking about parts 1 & 2 together when watched one after the other, as they should be.<br /><br />thank you jon anderson, steven soderbergh & benicio del toro.<br /><br />this film is a refreshing, bold, gritty and true film. and, it hearkens a new style of film making. no faux drama. no swelling sound track. not faux documentary style. just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts. i have been reading jon anderson's "che guevara: a revolutionary life" and recently finished fidel's auto biography, and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly. but i have to say that it is jon anderson's exhaustive, penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone. anderson was consultant on this film (or these 2 films). what makes this film a true thing is that it is clean. no swelling music or slow-motion photography to heighten drama, and even more importantly; no fake documentary shaky camera. just square shots and straight forward shooting style. the type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle. benicio del toro should be given full honors for this, i never doubted him as che throughout the film... not once. he did a wonderful job and i will respect him for ever for this. some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole. but i think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film: it doesn't try to be everything. it doesn't try to 'tell the story'. a person's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 hours. this is one of the subtle beauties of this film, it resists that temptation, and stays focused on the intent of letting us get a feel for che, his developing militaristic mind and the forces around him. it focuses on 3 slices of time: the battle to over throw batista, che's u.n. speech and the gorilla preparations in bolivia. "motorcycle diaries" already told his young man side, and i applaud s. soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead. i keep referring to jon anderson's book and the film stays true. the only weak link for me are the casting (not the performance) of matt damon. in a film so loaded with true to life performances, an american, (matt damon) playing a bolivian is a clunky stretch - he does well, but after so much care in the casting, this was an over-site. small and completely forgiven. the reality that the rest of the casting gives you, and most notably benicio del toro's amazing job, put's this film at the top of my list.<br /><br />the fact that this film went almost straight to video say's something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the 'revolutionized cuba' to become what it might have, are still at work keeping it's story quiet. if not out of clandestine muffling, then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic.<br /><br />this is a must see film, and jon anderson's "che guevara: a revolutionary life" is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess moves of the 40's, 50's & 60's that placed unfair pressure on our south american neighbors, and the effects it fostered.
