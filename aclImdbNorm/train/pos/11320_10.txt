well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by it's greatness. fantastic script, great acting, costumes and special effects, and the plot twists, wow!! in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself.<br /><br />great, i would recommend this film to anyone, especially if i don;t like them much.<br /><br />terrific
