curly sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life as a drifter. she and her father, bill (jim belushi), try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists. in chicago, bill decides to jump in front of a car in a pricey parking garage while curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim. it happens to be a very upscale lawyer named grey (kelly lynch) who is appropriately appalled at what she has done. not only do the scammers make some cash, they get to spend the night at grey's plush apartment. even then, grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell. grey only knows the lucrative law business and nothing about life. who better to teach her than bill and curly, those savvy experts on life's realities? but, all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of con men. or is there? this is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. curly is certainly as entertaining as shirley temple but much edgier, of course. belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch lawyer. john hughes, as writer and director, shows us his magic touch once again, as the script is lively and unpredictable. just watch curly and bill take grey out for a night, with no money, and see the humorous results. do you long for happy endings, long promised and finally delivered, with a few uncertain moments in between? this is your made-to-order movie.
