rob estes, josie bisset and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them.<br /><br />basically, rob and josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a vegas vacation. they each come home to find that their respective children already know of the nuptials due to tabloid-like not-so-fodder. they, rob and josie, move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other's house.<br /><br />rob builds furniture, i think, which is close enough to frank lambert's (patrick duffy) construction job on the much similar step by step to warrant eternal mockage.<br /><br />josie is some sort of cookie-making queen, though it doesn't look like she makes any of the cookies. not close enough to carol foster's (suzanne somers)hairdressing job to warrant likeness mockage, but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity mockage.<br /><br />unlike step by step, they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one another's last names, or so one assumes if their serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together.<br /><br />anyhow, there are eight kids; moira, sandy, jeff, lily, daisy, nathan, andrew l. and andrew b. i, personally, think they should've just called the younger andrew 'andy'.<br /><br />there's a lot of product placement, particularly for soup at hand (which is disgusting) and listerine pocket packs. there are also some stupid, senseless moments. it's also not a great film to promote happy families.<br /><br />but, hey! rob estes! this concludes my review of 'step by step... on some really bad drugs.' watch it for rob estes and his pretty!eyes. there are some great pretty!eyes shots.
