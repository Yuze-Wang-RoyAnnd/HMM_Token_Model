the movie is a real show of how unemotional and selfish the upper society has become. it has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person. no character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical indian movies and no character is 100% bad rather all are just different. the movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions, drama and entertainment. for the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions. i would recommend all to see the movie. madhavi sharma is a journalist who covers those hip-shaking parties of bollywood for the page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. but this is not all, then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed. even she is fired from the job. then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do page 3 again. not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie. i would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie. please do not afford to miss it.
