just saw ice age, a very funny and especially nice looking film. the story is simple but effective, the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design.<br /><br />more inspired by traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you a really, really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour. sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it's a fantasy-world based on reality. including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering.<br /><br />pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how.<br /><br />enough technical babble, the film's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny.
