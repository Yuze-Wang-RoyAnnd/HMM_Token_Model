this was a fabulous adaptation of jane eyre. the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like zelah clarke. i thought she was too old and made jane seem much to timid. in the book jane seemed like a much stronger character. i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. the part where it's the morning after rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. i think they made a bad choice in casting her. but dalton was absolutely wonderful as rochester. he makes this version of jane eyre worth seeing. another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film. i know it was made in the eighties for tv. if it had been a feature film, and better quality, it would have been perfect. my main complaint however, is that zelah clarke was definitely too old.
