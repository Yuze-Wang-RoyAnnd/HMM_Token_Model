this movie has it all. sight gags, subtle jokes, play on words and verses. it is about a rag tag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to defeat a common enemy. if you watch this more than once, you will find you are quoting it like animal house (and yes i love animal house also). i put in the top 15 funniest movies. the major at a boys military academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause trouble (in this movie he is right). he is sadistic, uncaring, cruel and has to be taken down. the group of boys that do not get along at first, end up teaming together to survive and get rid of the major with a wacky plan only mad magazine could of wrote. a must see - you will love it!
