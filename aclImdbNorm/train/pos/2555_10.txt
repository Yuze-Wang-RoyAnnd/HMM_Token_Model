the movie wasn't all that great. the book is better. but the movie wasn't all that bad either. it was interesting to say the least. the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldn't say i was actually interested in the movie itself. janine turner and antonio sabato jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching :)they have a few cute scene's that should appeal to the romantic's. overall i'd give the movie a 7 or 8. it wasn't bad, just a little lacking plot wise.
