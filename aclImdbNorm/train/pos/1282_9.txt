saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. a semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the lack of it), focusing on some seriously wacked, way-beyond-the-hollywood-fringe dwellers. it had an amusing early performance from mark ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the dp who did the polish brothers movies. there was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart. this film had cult classic written all over it, and i'm surprised it's not yet out on dvd. <br /><br />hopefully soon.
