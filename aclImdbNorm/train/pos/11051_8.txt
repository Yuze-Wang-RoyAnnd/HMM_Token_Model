"mal'efique" is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well-executed plot and a lot of heart. its cast doesn't have recognized names, it doesn't have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect; but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well-written script, an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills. eric valette may not be a well-know name yet, but with "mal'efique", his feature length debut, he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet, gans or aja.<br /><br />the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell, four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal: to get out. carr`ere (g'erald laroche) gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi-millionaire fraud; his cell-mates, the violent marcus (clovis cornillac), the intellectual lassalle (philippe laudenbach) and the mentally challenged p^aquerette (dimitri rataud), are all convicted for murder and give carr`ere a cold welcome. their personalities will clash as carr`ere discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic.<br /><br />written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier, "mal'efique" is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barker's stories. the movie's strongest point is the way it builds up the characters, they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities. the story's supernatural element is very well-handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel. despite being a movie about four men locked in a room, the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact, the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust, claustrophobia, and specially, paranoia.<br /><br />director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere, mood and his cast to give life to the plot. despite its obvious lack of budget, he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original, fresh and very attractive. his subtle and effective camera-work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location, and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot. the very few displays of special effects are very well-done and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore.<br /><br />the characters are what make this film work, and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit. g'erald laroche is excellent as carr`ere, a man at first sight innocent, but who hides a dark past. philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too, specially rataud in his very demanding role. however, is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus, a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself. the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them.<br /><br />the movie is terrific, but it is not without its share of flaws. of course, the most notorious one is its the low-budget. some of the cgi-effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make-up and prosthetics used in other scenes, however, it is never too bad for it. probably the bad thing about "mal'efique" is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters, not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view.<br /><br />anyways, "mal'efique" is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately, and one that deserves to have more recognition. valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest (albeit complex) tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities. personally, this film is a new favorite. 8/10
