ok, so it's an adult movie. but it really is very tastefully done. it's obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money into making a classy sort of movie. i was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was. even the acting was fairly decent. the plot was more solid than most adult films i've seen. the camera work was above average. it's just a good flick!!
