saw this as previous viewer by accident, i have watched it twice now. i thoroughly enjoyed it, no silly thought provoking messages just plain good fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and a just a feel good film highly recommended to those of us that just like to enjoy films and not dissect them great fun for all the family here. i didn't realise rosie alvarez is played by vanessa williams, she is excellent and very sultry. the songs like one boy and one last kiss are really enjoyable to listen to and to tap your feet to jason alexander is the complete contrast to his character in pretty woman ans is very good. tyne daley still sticks in my mind from cagney and lacey and her voice and accent still had that remembrance in it. overall i just loved it and will be looking to purchase it if it is available
