this early biograph short was so much fun to watch. the second on disc one of d.w. griffith's "years of discovery" dvd set (highly recommended) it features three excellent performances by the main leads, and interesting to see henry b. walthall (the little colonel, birth of a nation) as a campy musician giving a countess the eye (and other things).<br /><br />the countess' husband goes berserk at his wife's betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour. it's kind of incredible that they wouldn't hear the wall going up, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. here mr. johnson (father of silent player raymond hackett) gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. the best moment comes at the end. as the lady passes out from shock and fear, once she realizes she's doomed, henry picks up his instrument and "fans" it over her. the way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy, and i just lost it, and laughed my head off. the expression on his face! from that moment i was charmed by henry b. walthall.
