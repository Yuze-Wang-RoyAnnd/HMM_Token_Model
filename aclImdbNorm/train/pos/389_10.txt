yeah right. sammo hung already acted in the main role in 1983's "zu warrios from the magic mountain". now, 2001, he does it again with "zu warriors". but this time, he finally does it right. you seldom see him in wuxia, more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick. but this role simply does fit him! the ancient chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies (as far as i know about movies translated for the west). although, the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities. straight said: you haven't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie! and that makes it so great! and wow: all the colors plus the enormously deep, right-into-the-heart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant. the first time i watched it, i had to watch it again instantly, and i did. ok true, i didn't understand all of it the first time. but that makes it only better! you know, you didn't understand all of it, because there is so much spice in it! therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again. and yeah, it grows deeper in your heart, the more often you watch it.<br /><br />summary: a story to love, characters you cry with, and truly: a movie you never forget! -- editors note: well, i think i must watch it right now again :d
