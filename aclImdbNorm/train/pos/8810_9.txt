i first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct trio channel a few years ago, and recently watched it again--sans commercials--on sundance. i was impressed the first time, and found it even more engaging on second viewing. yes, some of the segments are far from perfect--amos gitai's hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb--but taken collectively, 11 09 01 is a total success. best of show: shohei imamura's amazing final segment, which contemporary critics such as the thick-witted mick lasalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on 'the terrorists', but now stands revealed as a masterful anti-war polemic; samira makhmalbaf's opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9/11 with a prescient concern for the children of afghanistan; and idrissa ouedraogo's amusing children's crusade for osama bin laden--a hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the real osama. youssef chahine's segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that bin laden and al'qaeda are basically creations of american foreign policy and the cia, and though sean penn's character study seems out of place, it's still an effectively bittersweet piece of film-making. all in all, essential viewing, and a darn sight better than oliver stone's reactionary world trade center.
