scoop *** out of **** woody allen is definitely not my favorite director, but i enjoyed "match point." it was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star woody allen. it did have the beautiful scarlett johansson in it.<br /><br />"scoop" is woody allen's latest film and though he appears in this one, it's ok. it also features scarlett johansson and the two of them work perfect together.<br /><br />johansson plays sondra pransky, a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of joe strombel (ian mcshane.) joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the reaper has taken. one of those souls is the secretary of peter lyman (hugh jackman.) she tells joe that peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of england. joe, with the scoop of a life time, travels back to the living and gives this info to sondra, during a magic act. sondra is at some magic show with magician sid waterman (woody allen.) she becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box, she gets the visit from joe. not knowing what to do, she enlists the help of sid waterman to help her crack the case.<br /><br />this film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to "match point" and yet it all works. johansson and allen work great together. allen's humor fits perfect for this story and role. hugh jackman is terrific as peter layman, the "suspected" serial killer.<br /><br />this is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch. the cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching woody allen be himself. i say give it a chance because you just might like it.
