this film deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy. while i found that world morally repulsive, the film did best what storytelling should do, and that is take us through an experience that we would otherwise never undergo. tim meadows so convincingly portrays leon phelps, and the story so drew me into the reckless world of leon, that i momentarily forgot that i was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against it. herein lies the film's undoing because its great and bold achievement in storytelling comes at the price of its own success. understanding that the vast majority of moviegoers will respond only to the story of this film that lies on the surface, and reject that story, i hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that i loved it. i loved it not only for its fascinating insights into the deluded mind of the playboy, not only for its amusing portrayal of the idiocy of the human sex drive, but also for its courage to fearlessly explore what is in the shadows of heterosexuality. besides, it's just funny.
