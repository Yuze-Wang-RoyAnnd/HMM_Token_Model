how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me. i loved this show before i even saw it. for 3 reasons, 1. the story intrigued me, 2. jessica alba and 3. james cameron! please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that it's bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season 1 as well as season 2 on dvd and then join the campaign to get season 3 made!<br /><br />i hate fox and i'm sure a lot of you "dark angel" fans hate them too. they have a thing for canning good shows! don't you all agree?
