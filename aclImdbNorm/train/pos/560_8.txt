another very good mann flick thanks to the father/son combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart. brennan (ben tatum) is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne (red river/ rio bravo). he's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend. "you're wrong mr. dunston". jeff webster(stewart) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan. john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it. another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people. the loner can do neither and suffers for it.<br /><br />the caption above plays on tatum's assertion that he can't live without his coffee. this nicotine addiction proves fatal. probably the first and last time on the screen.<br /><br />i recommend this film and now own the dvd.
