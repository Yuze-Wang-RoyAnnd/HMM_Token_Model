about 1986 i saw this movie by accident on tv one night. i was 6 years old. it was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to don't look now in 1987. i went to venice on holiday the next year in silent terror, hoping to god that my parents wouldn't find out i'd watched it! <br /><br />would i have minded if my parents knew i'd watched les valseuses when i was a kid? i'd probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays, and my mum's probably disapproving in the afterlife. i don't know if they'd want to see it anyway. from the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes i'm never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if it's a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself. <br /><br />it's definitely violent. it has a violent view of sex, virtually no acknowledgement of love. even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation. but the scenario is very erotic and (god i'm so british) arousing! do they suck her breasts for her own good? that is exploitation. so why am i getting a woody?<br /><br />the fellows go in search of an experienced older woman, find an ex-con, mother-figure? i don't know. it ends in a truly gruesome suicide. i described it to my friend jb nelson, who has cannibal holocaust-guts, and he went eeuurrgghh! no motherly love for this movie, quite the opposite. mutilation of where the boys began. why do they shoot the girl in the leg? why does she come back to them? do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from men?<br /><br />i'm thinking of two movies, one of which i wish i'd never seen, the other makes me wish it wasn't such a harsh world. swept away/madonna what a pile of insanity doesn't compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so enraged i cant use punctuation! once upon a time in america/leone god why does noodles do it? destroys the path to joy we've been following him on his whole life. so close to finally finding love with deborah. now they are both destroyed. why sergio? why?<br /><br />there is no rape in les valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance, of both sexes. very honest, no titillation. no fantasy shags, no perfect hollywood smooth moves. jokes, yes. but there's too much darkness and jealousy and trickery in here to call it a sex comedy. forget carry on shooting a naked hairdresser in the leg cos she'll come back & you'll hook her up with your ex-con lover's vengeant son & she'll learn how to cum from him.<br /><br />two things i can't stand are rape movies and prison movies. les valseuses isn't a rape movie! god nobody's going to want to watch it now! it is a brilliant movie!
