i first saw this as a child living in east london. the scars of hitlers luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street. i remember having nightmares after seeing it. the odd thing is, it really hasn't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in cinema fiction. <br /><br />apart from a globally destructive war, the scale of the machines was badly awry, more nano-technology now, but overall, an excellent and well-crafted work. it was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then. i would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts. however, much was right. mans desire for war, mans inhumanity to man. the means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /><br />
