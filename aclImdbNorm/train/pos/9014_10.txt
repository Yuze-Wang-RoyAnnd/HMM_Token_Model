shamefully, before i saw this film, i was unfamiliar with helena bonham carter.<br /><br />i had to do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with. i was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady. she pulled it of flawlessly.<br /><br />who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could be interpreted as tender, and romantic? well, they can be, when the right performers present them in the proper manner, as they did in this wonderful movie. i forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful miss carter looked in this movie. i have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth, but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie.<br /><br />i hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as i did. thank you for letting me express my opinion.
