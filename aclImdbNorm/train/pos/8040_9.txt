this will be somewhat short. first, don't listen to the critics, as it is not as bad as most say it is!! sniper uses a classic movie formula, which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie. while sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work, it does give those who know nothing about the professional sniper a glimpse into the world of the sniper. and yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie doesn't? there are many good scenes and good acting by tom berenger. i have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with billy zane in the helicopter followed by zane in the marine's bar scene. the best scene in sniper is with berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it!! also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope. and yes, the sniper motto is `one shot, one kill'. judge sniper for yourself!!<br /><br />
