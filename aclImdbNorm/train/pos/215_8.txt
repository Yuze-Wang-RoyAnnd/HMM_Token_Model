the word 'classic' is thrown around too loosely nowadays, but this movie well deserves the appelation. the combination of neil simon, walter matthau (possibly the world's best living comic actor), and the late lamented george burns make for a comic masterpiece. it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented jack benny from playing george burns' part, as had been planned. as it is, the reunion scene in matthau's apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter. definitely one of my desert island films.<br /><br />"enter!!!!!!!!!"
