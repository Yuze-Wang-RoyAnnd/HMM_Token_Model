this movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men, and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer. few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence, and i can think of no other movie -- documentary or drama -- that achieves it. there is no other movie in which i have both laughed so much and cried so much. yes, it is about dmd and accessible travel; on those issues alone, it is a worthwhile venture, but it is more. it is about friendship. it is about life itself, about living every day that you're alive. and it's a great, fun, adventurous narrative. this is why god created the cinema! see this movie!!!
