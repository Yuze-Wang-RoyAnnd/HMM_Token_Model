not to be confused with the british black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. but this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher.<br /><br />the plot goes = 4 sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in florida, but they're plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman, and when he realizes that he was seen, well let's just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff.<br /><br />shallow grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80's, especially the late 80's which was when the slashers kinda went downhill, this was one of the few that didn't and this movie should be more well known, it's a pity it isn't. this is one film that actually confounds stereotypes (just try guessing who the final girl is going to be - i got it totally wrong). the principle cast are all likable and it's one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away, which of course they don't. this, coupled with the fluffiness of the film's first half-an-hour jars (in a good way) with some flashes of real nastiness (the second murder provides a real jolt) and some unexpected sleaziness (even though this isn't a high budget thriller i didn't expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast), in a film from this late in the 80's).<br /><br />there are one or two bad things about this movie, well not bad just minor, like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn't go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic. there aren't any sharp implements in shallow grave but, to my mind at least, it's a slasher flick through and through. the scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent sheriff are tense and exciting.<br /><br />all in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher, with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff.
