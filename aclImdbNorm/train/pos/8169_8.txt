this is a gory mess and pretty convincing. corbin bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner. linda hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her, the little "tryst" with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile! the last half hour of the movie is devoted to bernson's character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called virginya keehne. an extremely talented performer, she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off. nice legs, too!
