an old saying goes "if you think you have problems, visit a hospital." that has been updated in recent years to "if you think you have problems, watch a tv talk show...especially jerry springer's!" this movie is one of those that is so bad, it's good! that's why i gave it a seven-it's all right, but not great. it's a great way to waste 95 minutes, just as the daily talk show is advertised as "an hour of your life you'll never get back!" all the familiar themes are here...unfaithful husbands/boyfriends, the wildest audience on television, women flashing jerry, etc. the shocker was watching molly hagan, who normally plays sweet characters ("seinfeld" and "herman's head") playing a trailer-trash mom and jaime pressly ("my name is earl") as her equally trashy daughter, performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact. the men (including the staff producer) were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got. i don't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show. here in phoenix, it's shown back-to-back for two hours every morning and, after that, everything else seems to pale. again, i give this movie a seven...it's good but not great. jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses.
