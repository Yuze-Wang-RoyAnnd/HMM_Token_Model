reading the various external reviews of roger ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much i love this movie, even though i only have a dubbed-into-japanese video version of it.<br /><br />apparently, many critics seem to take it as a minus that the story premise has been used before, most famously in the very great "it's a wonderful life." to me, a great premise is a great premise no matter how many times it's used, and i'd be happy to see more movies using this particular premise--the discontented man who gets a chance to gain a fresh perspective on his own life through a bit of "divine magic."<br /><br />i suppose folks and critics of a more intellectual bent are not as pulled into the story, but i don't go to movies to critique them with notebook in hand--i go to movies to throw myself into them and let them take me where they will. <br /><br />if you are sentimental sort like myself, you'll be well rewarded by seeing this picture. the performances are excellent throughout, and the movie was very well cast. wonderful choice of music, too. michael caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender. jim belushi does a great job as an "average joe" kind of guy who wonders if his life hasn't gone as it should. linda hamilton, always excellent, is again right on target here as the loving wife. jon lovitz entertains as usual, and even has some surprisingly moving moments in "mr. destiny."<br /><br />no, "mr. destiny" is not "it's a wonderful life," but who says it has to be? taken on its own terms, "mr. destiny" is an enjoyable, well-made, funny, and moving film. i've seen my japanese-dubbed video of it numerous times, and i'm sure i'll see it several more times. if that somehow makes me a "lowbrow," so be it! i'm just glad that i hadn't read any reviews of "mr. destiny" before seeing it.<br /><br />i suppose i should have the courage of my convictions and give the movie nine or ten stars, but i couldn't help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews!
