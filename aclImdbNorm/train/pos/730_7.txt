i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell (played by p.j. soles) is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song "i want you around" ...very very cool stuff.<br /><br />it was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. yes i'll admit that the ending is way-way over the top and far fetched ...but it doesn't matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie. it's sex, pot and rock n rocll forever<br /><br />i read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this ..but i do not know if this is true or not
