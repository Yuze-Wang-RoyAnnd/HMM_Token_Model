i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience. as we put our boats into the water, banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind. this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature. we see it in the bow fishing. we see it in the home made tent. there is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman "cracker". the fact that the banker from atlanta (ned beatty) has "bad teeth" is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth. ultimately, the struggle of life and death supersedes "civilized man's" suppositives about "the law". this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer, but alas not soon enough for the characters.
