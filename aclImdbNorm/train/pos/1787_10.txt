the danes character finally let's buddy have the awful truth. ""leave me alone, kiss men if you want to," she screams self-righteously in front of everyone, thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long. nice girl. this might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that danes pours into this character. great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying, but hey, remember, there are no mistakes, except, maybe, seeing this film. <br /><br />wait a minute. this irony is intended! this is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit, yes! but somehow i doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind, sadly. maybe there are a few mistakes, after all.
