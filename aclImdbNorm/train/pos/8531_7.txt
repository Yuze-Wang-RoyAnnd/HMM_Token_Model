although the plot was a bit sappy at times, and very rushed at the end, as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story, overall it was pretty good for the made-for-backwoods-cable-tv genre. <br /><br />however, the actress who played the babysitter, mariana klaveno, was very good! i hope to see more of her around in movie-land. the music was also well done, getting every possible chill out of the dah-duh-dah-duh (think "jaws") type music-based tension build-ups.<br /><br />i don't think i'd want to watch "while the children sleep" again, but if i did, it would be to focus on the performance of the talented klaveno.
