these days spielberg's "the color purple" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven oscars and winning zilch. what's even more alarming is that spielberg himself wasn't even nominated for best director. needless to say, the film-makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded.<br /><br />the story concerns the trials and tribulations of celie johnson (whoopi goldberg), an african-american woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. the film spans several years and focuses mainly on celie's relationships with the women around her. it's told from a decidedly female perspective but you needn't fear that it's a saccharine 'chick flick'.<br /><br />the story is an interesting one, livened with humour at times although the central character's struggles are paramount. some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film's end but i didn't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />the film received three oscar nominations for acting: whoopi goldberg (best actress), oprah winfrey (best supporting actress) and margaret avery (best supporting actress). i think that goldberg and winfrey were certainly deserving and danny glover was unaccountably stiffed.<br /><br />as already mentioned, spielberg didn't receive a best director nomination for his efforts. such an omission beggars belief, since spielberg's direction here is top-notch. i'm not especially crazy about quincy jones's score but it's not below average by any means.<br /><br />in the end, the story is a satisfying one, well-told by a master film-maker working from pulitzer prize-winning material. give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as i am about how it could be so poorly treated on oscar night.
