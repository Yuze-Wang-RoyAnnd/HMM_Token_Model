mary tyler moore and valerie harper still can turn the world on with their smiles. the combined talent of these two wonderful stars make this combination reunion/newstart movie work. watch it and look forward to hitting sixty! mary defies the youth oriented society with wit and charm. a touch of drama adds 2000 realism. a tv series follow up would broaden the new characters and give us a chance to occaisionally see lou grant, phyllis, sue ann, murray, and georgette!
