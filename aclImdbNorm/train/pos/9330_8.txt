"dangerous offender" is the story of a seemingly anti-social girl, and how she got that way. it's based on a true story, and though i was irritated by the one-note depiction i.e. ever scowling, of the title character, and the hard-to-believe dedication of her lawyer, i'm forced to accept that life does imitate art, and that there are people out there like that.<br /><br />the movie succeeds, for me, because, although there's little softening of the title character's demeanour until almost the end, one is gradually moved to sympathy for her, as the movie shows how she got to her present state - which proves to be self-destructive, rather than anti-social.<br /><br />truly a moving movie, which will bring a lump to your throat, when you think on it - which will be often.<br /><br />despite its many flaws,(including that it's hard to watch, sometimes, because of bodily functions, and suicide attempts)this is another production that i'm proud to call canadian.
