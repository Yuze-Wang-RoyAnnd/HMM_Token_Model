this movie is not for everyone. you're either bright enough to get "it" or you're not. fans of sci-fi films who don't take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie. i recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies. everyone i've recommended this film to has enjoyed it. if you enjoy monty python or mel brooks films, you'll probably enjoy this one. the voice characterizations are done in a tongue-in-cheek manner and the one-liners fly fast and furious.
