this movie is witty, watchable and utterly touching. and now often do you get to see jean harlow (or any actress of this era, for that matter) give another woman a swift punch in the jaw? (twice!)<br /><br />after harlow's ruby is sent to a reformatory after getting mixed up with gable's edward hall (he of that cheesy yet endearing crooked smile), her predicament becomes all the more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant, and she's convinced that this rake has abandoned her, but in fact, her love has reformed him and he comes to see her, despite the fact that he will be arrested, and from the help of a minister, are married.<br /><br />the wonderful relationship that harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with gable, who was her most frequent leading man. her cynical character is a perfect match for gable's smooth-talking crook. what's not to like?<br /><br />"you know, you wouldn't be a bad looking dame - if it wasn't for your face!" ruby cuttingly remarks to gypsy, her rival. "if you're going to get that close to me, i'll have to open the other window!"<br /><br />priceless!!!
