the original vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters. i was quite surprised at how this played out. as a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. though this one was not a great movie, the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact. jon bon jovi was a drawback initially, but he proved to be a half-way decent slayer. i doubt anyone could top james wood's performance in the first one, though... unless you bring in buffy!<br /><br />all in all, this was a decent watch & i would watch it again.<br /><br />i was left with two questions, though... what happened to jack crow & how did derek bliss come to be a slayer? guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination.
