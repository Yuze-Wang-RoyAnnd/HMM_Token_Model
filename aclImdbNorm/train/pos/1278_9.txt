"the last big thing" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best...<br /><br />simon geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called "the next big thing". thing is, this magazine doesnt really exist, and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only to bitch-slap them silly, insulting their way of buying into pop culture. his live-in female friend, darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and simon, as well as her and her father. darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character, depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best. brent is a flat character with not much to him, as is tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of b-rated rock bands. still, these characters weave a very interesting web together. and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd. mark my words!<br /><br />
