for those of you who are not aware with the theme that kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the western assault on traditional serbian values--it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. this continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that kusturica has elected to mandate. since his fantastic work and magnum opus 'underground', kusturica's films' 'black cat white cat', 'life is a miracle', and recently with 'promise me this', his slapstick, carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization' of balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. in the case of 'promise me this', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are contrasted. the world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager. the end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. they are on a collision coarse; appropriately, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, are about to collide with the funeral mourners, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. yet kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique, stylistic singularity. with his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.
