this is definitely one of jet's best efforts. few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can. the action is rapid-fire, and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes. as a result, it may take americans a little off-guard. a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film. i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jet's work and look forward to further masterpieces (especially fist of legend) making it into the us market. a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts.
