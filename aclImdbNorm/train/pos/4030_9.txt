this movie was absolutely wonderful. the pre-partition time and culture has been recreated beautifully. urmila has given yet another brilliant performance. what i truly admire about this movie is that it doesn't resort to pakistan-bashing that is running rampant in movies like gadar and loc. with the partition as a backdrop, the movie does not divert to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong. the movie always centers around the tragic story of urmila's life. her fragile relationship with manoj bajpai has been depicted excellently. the movie actually shows how the people, both hindus and muslims, have suffered from this partition. the theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film.
