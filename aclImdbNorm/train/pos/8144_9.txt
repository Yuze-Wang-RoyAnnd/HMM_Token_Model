having seen both "fear of a black hat" and "this is spinal tap", i can honestly state that while similar, both movies are truly must see. there will be many times in "fear" that will have you in hysterics. it is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following. "fear" will soon be available on dvd. rent it if you must, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
