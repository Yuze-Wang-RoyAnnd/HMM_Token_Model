you can do a lot with a little cash. blair witch proved that. this film supports it. it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity. however, because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a shoestring. the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere, bumbling watson, his dimness and slowness foils cleese's quick-tempered wit. if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two.
