"holes" is my all-time favorite movie! so far i have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking forward to purchasing it on dvd this upcoming september. i read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how alike the book and movie were. the director of this film did an excellent job of re-creating the book into movie form. also, all of the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters, especially max kasch as zigzag. props to all those involved in making this movie, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, i definitely recommend it for everyone to see!
