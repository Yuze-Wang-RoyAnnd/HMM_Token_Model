rather nasty piece of business featuring bela lugosi as a mad scientist (with yes, a renfield-like assistant and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist's wife (sounds like a greenaway movie actually lol). lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides (why them? who knows?) so that his wife can keep looking beautiful. he gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar. after another bride bites the dust, a newspaper reporter just happens to be around for the scoop, and decides to snoop around for a story. she gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and lugosi. heaven knows where the police were. soon she's off to bela's lair, when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil. it all cumulates in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist, but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision, as he foils her plans, oh no! what will happen? i actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. lugosi is great here, his hangers-on are all very very strange, the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable. a fun little view.
