i did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. the story is a little strange sometimes but overall i think it has an acceptable credibility. the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to us movies. this may not be the best movie ever but it's uncommon for sweden and i hope to see more similar ones in the future.
