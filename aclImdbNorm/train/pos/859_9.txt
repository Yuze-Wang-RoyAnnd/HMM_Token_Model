it's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that can't be figured out at every turn. surprises throughout delighting throughout.<br /><br />a couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays "the good girl, hard worker" and yet in the end she ends up being an anti-social risk taker. that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pause.<br /><br />the other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film. i never did get who he was or what his issues were. if anyone has any ideas, i'd like to hear what they might be.<br /><br />the film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing. very much worth seeing.
