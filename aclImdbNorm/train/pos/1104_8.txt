the film opens with bill coles (melvyn douglas) telling a story about how his best friend--make that client--jim blandings (cary grant) and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment, with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms. when jim's wife, muriel (myrna loy), wants to renovate the apartment, advertising exec jim falls in love with (or falls for!) an ad for a house. once he's purchased the house, bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jim's 'dream house' goes wrong.<br /><br />one of three collaborations between grant and loy, this is a charming little comedy--not very taxing, with no real great message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. the laughs are there right from the start, when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off, only to be thwarted at every turn by muriel. the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros, and that's just what grant and loy give us: polished performances, simple chemistry, and a lot of fun. myrna loy is in a pretty thankless role (it's evident that grant's character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting, and grant, as always, pulls both off with remarkable aplomb), but she gives muriel a colour, life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character. melvyn douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well, never hitting a single wrong note.<br /><br />one of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the 'store room', and jim goes to 'save' him... only to get everyone trapped inside! every little problem that pops up for the blandings renovation project--including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'wham'--seems to bring together everything that *could* go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch. 8/10
