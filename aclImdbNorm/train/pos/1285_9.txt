frustrated middle-aged deputy district attorney george maxwell (a fine performance by george e. carey, who also produced this picture) can't stand his naggy, frigid wife edith (a perfectly bitchy anne bellamy) anymore. worse yet, poor george is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (dishy brunette sheri jackson). george has an adulterous fling with lovely, enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson (delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout patricia wymer). complications ensue when george finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter julia freeman (a nicely venomous turn by kathy williams), who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence mackey (a frightening robert tessier, who sports a head full of hair here) from jail. director tom laughlin (yep, the same dude who portrayed billy jack!) and screenwriter james mclarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, sizzling soft-core sex, and raw violence. moreover, they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time, thus ensuring that this movie doesn't overstay its welcome. one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her groovy friends over the maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking, wailing rock music, and, of course, hot naked dancing chicks. robert o. ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot. stanton fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on. best of all, this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie patricia wymer, who positively lights up the screen with her sweet, bubbly personality and captivating beauty. a total trashy treat.
