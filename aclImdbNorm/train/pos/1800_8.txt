all dogs go to heaven is on a par with watership down for scary kiddies films. both were dark and pretty sinister, but at the same time the most mesmerising experience a child can have. this was one of my favourite films as a kid. i was in love with charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, i'll admit... i had a crush on a cartoon dog. all dogs tells the dark story of lovable cad charlie and his partner in crime itchy. the story starts with charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling. of course, as a child, i didn't understand the concept of this film. i loved the songs and the animation but as i've got older i do begin to wonder why i wasn't disturbed by this film as a youngster. it deals with pretty adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and prison but in a world of goody-goody disney films, it's something every child should watch once. <br /><br />yes, there's some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when i was little, but it delivers such a poignant message that should not be ignored by parents!
