this film is stunningly beautiful. goldsworthy's art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful, moving and changing and blossoming. i strongly recommend this movie to everyone. i can think of nothing else to say about it. it's just the kind of movie you have to see, because it's so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when i left the theatre.
