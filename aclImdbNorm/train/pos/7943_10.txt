i love this tv series so much. it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful. i cant believe that they cut it off tv, and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but i'm not sure. cybersix was by far the best tv show ever. i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so i'm really glad i got to watch it. i luved it so much <3 <br /><br />its about a women by the name of cybersix, she is not human. she goes by adrian sieldman, a man teacher at a highschool. now cybersix is actually a women, she is just disguised as a man in the day. by night cybersix patrols the city.<br /><br />a guy by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix, and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her.<br /><br />if u have never watched it before u should totally download it. it was the best tv show in the world. why did they cut it off???? some people have issues. but i'm glad i got to watch the 13 episodes.
