first off, this really is my favorite film ever. i don't need to give anyone a description because every a**hole does that. i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless, cheesy, lame effects having', boom-stick showing', badly edited, 80's metal horror masterpiece. the director (i heard) had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddy/jason type of deal for himself. damn, i wish that could've went down like that! the soundtrack's banging'. the acting's good....check this mofo out. and any die-hard fans out there, feel free to email and chat sometime. midgetorgy....i can be found at yahoo.
