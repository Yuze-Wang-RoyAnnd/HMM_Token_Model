i admit not being that fond of oliver! as a young child--it's long, and the story is a little slow-moving because of all the musical numbers. as a teenager i discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself. rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of oliver twist, think of it as a celebration of the classic story. the adaptation is loose at best, but really, if you're watching a musical, you ain't there for the story.<br /><br />the music is the core of this movie, and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy. most or all of the cast was involved in the stage version of the musical, and it shows in their performances--and i consider this a plus. the performances are all in a more "stagey" style of acting typical of much older films, and they are very entertaining. the exception is the kid playing oliver, whose job seemed to be to look cute and stay out of the real performers' way.<br /><br />fagin and the dodger are the real stars of this movie. oliver reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an intimidating screen presence as the menacing bill sykes. even sykes' dog bullseye puts on a good performance.<br /><br />this movie isn't for everyone. people who hate musicals will despise it, as will those who take musicals too seriously. nitpicking over faulty historical details or mistaking exaggerated stage-type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone's enjoyment. just sit back and enjoy the entertainment--it's much better if you remember that, as a musical, it's a fantasy loosely organized around the book, not a strict adaptation.
