i realize that alot of people hate this movie, but i must admit that it is one of my favorites. i happen to like it better then its predeccesor and happy to like it better than alot of movies.<br /><br />first off, i think that people never give the story any credit, much like back to the future, time travel is hard to write, and in this movie they included time travel and a spiritual journey.<br /><br />i also feel that keanu and alex were on there best performances in this movie, they looked cooler, acted cooler, and said cooler things.<br /><br />the set design of this movie is awsome as well, the sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two teenage buds who can hardly spell...but isnt that the genius of the whole franchise, making these two idiots bigger than life characters that are responsible for the entire utopian future of earth.<br /><br />the costume design was awsome as well. bill and ted actually look cool in bogus journey, where as in excellent adventure they look rather like, well as they would put it, fags!!!<br /><br />even the music in this movie is awsome, the score especially. there so much i could say about this film, cause i love it. but this is one of those movies i grew up watching and everytime i did i liked it more, so i can understand why people hate or just think its bogus compared to excellent adventure (which i also love by the way).<br /><br />get down with your bad self!!!!
