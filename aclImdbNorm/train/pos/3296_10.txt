mina kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing, to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies. the director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible. the music and dancing is of the highest possible quality. you may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the background:other girl dancing, a drunk falling down stairs, much activity, but he knew that we would be watching mina dance and i'll bet unless you viewed this many times, you didn't notice.all in all, perfection.j.q.
