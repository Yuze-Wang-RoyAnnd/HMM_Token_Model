when i heard this film was directed by ang lee, i made sure to see it. this taiwanese director burst into fame with "the wedding banquet" and "eat drink man woman" a few years ago and then moved on to "sense and sensibility" and "the ice storm". now, he turns his attention to another american icon -- the civil war.<br /><br />this story takes place in missouri, a union state with southern sympathies. these never officially joined the confederate army. instead, they formed outlaw bands, called "bushwhackers", grew they hair long, and sometimes would confiscated union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing.<br /><br />the movie depicts their moral dilemma, the high drama of the times, and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the union. there are no stars in this movie, unless you consider "jewel" the singer, well cast as a young confederate widow as a star.<br /><br />tobey macquire is cast as a young german farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the germans were supposed union sympathizers. this young man is an excellent actor, full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he's exposed to the horror of war.<br /><br />jeffrey wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. he gives a fine and understated performance.<br /><br />some of the acting, however, is wooden, especially in the long conversations they have about morality. and their costumes are too new. and the "southern gentleman" theme of manners and hat-tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much -- especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women's arms, then burn down the stores and houses.<br /><br />while i don't think that this will go down as one of lee ang's "great" movies, i did find myself fascinated by it, in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes. i was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history.<br /><br />not as much action as the usual war movie, but yet still recommended -- especially for civil war buffs.<br /><br />
