yeah, it's a bit of a silly film, so if you are looking for an oscar performance, forget this one......but, if you love john candy's humor, this is a must-see. we lost john candy before he made enough of his great brand of comedy, and he is only better in one movie: planes, trains, & automobiles (with steve martin). excellent supporting performance by eugene levy, perhaps his best work ever as the hot-headed sal dipasquale. also good acting by richard libertini, alley mills & pat hingle. you must see this obscure and out-of-print film if you are a john candy or eugene levy fan.
