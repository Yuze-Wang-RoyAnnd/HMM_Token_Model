the name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was all about, so i taped this film during the early hours of the am. if you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles in on the men. this film clearly wants to show that germany and france can work together and be friends after ww i and how the germans came to the aid of the french miners much to the unbelief of the french townsfolk. the actors were all outstanding, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine. there is an old old retired miner who manges to go down the mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down. if you are a real film buff, this is a film you will not want to miss.
