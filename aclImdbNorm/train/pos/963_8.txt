takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film, because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love: visitor q, gozu, izo, ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy. lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he's succeeding. still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction, so i was nervous. of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did.<br /><br />great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too. the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child: neverending story, labyrinth, return to oz, etc. i enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either. the dark underlying morals are there, but, it's also as silly as any kids film should be. i personally wasn't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics. i feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice.<br /><br />if you are a die hard takashi miike fan, you may not like this one. but, i suggest giving it a shot. it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is. he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones, which is very reassuring.<br /><br />to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one, i suggest these other miike films: 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china.' <br /><br />good job takashi miike! 8/10 stars.
