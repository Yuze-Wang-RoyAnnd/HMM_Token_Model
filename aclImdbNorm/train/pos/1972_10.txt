i don't understand your objections to this movie. it is a taut, thrilling extension of the character created in "basic instinct". the only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic, is the fact that sharon stone's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date.<br /><br />spoiler alert: as the movie progresses, we are presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) sharon stone's character is killing all these people because she's crazy (risk addicted); 2) david thewlis' crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame sharon stone's character; 3) david morrissey's analyst is killing these people for revenge. what upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the "real" story. (although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop; the only killing that occurs on screen.)<br /><br />i think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of "2001, a space odyssey." who cares what is real? the blonde really is crazy, the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. what's important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story. like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie. get over it!
