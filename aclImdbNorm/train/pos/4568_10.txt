seriously, can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget: daniel day-lewis, ray mcanally, brenda fricker, hugh o'conor and fiona shaw? there's no doubting that fricker and day-lewis deserved their awards: but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen o'conor (as young christie) and mcanally awarded: the clich'e is true here: they don't perform the roles, they inhabit them. day-lewis' performance is a tour de force - such a transformation that it is awe-inducing, but it was truly a mark of the academy's intelligence that alongside this performance, they also honoured brenda fricker's beautifully restrained, still and heart-wrenching work as christie's mother. by the way, if you haven't seen this magnificent actress in "swann", that's another film well worth checking out for her contribution (and the sublime miranda richardson).
