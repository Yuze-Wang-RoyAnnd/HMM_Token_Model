my daughter, her friends and i have watched this movie literally dozens of times. i bought it twice and some little girlfriends absconded with it. subsequently, i rented it so very many times. it just never gets old!!! blockbuster doesn't even have it in their listings anymore and i have tried to buy, find, rent it for over 5 years. without a doubt, this was and is my most favourite movie of my daughter's childhood...it has it all! we laughed, we cried, we discussed real life and how hard some children have it in the world. there was nothing pretend about this movie. we related to every second and every line bill! thanks a million for restoring our faith in human nature. sincerely, shelleen and kailin vandermey. craven, saskatchewan. canada,eh!!! :-)<br /><br />august '07 update:<br /><br />who are we to judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a man who has love chooses to raise a child who is not his own. it may not be my or your life. it is not only believable, it happens every day. thank god! keeps my faith in human nature alive!!! celebrate!!!!
