the dvd for "danaza macabra" (castle of blood) is very odd. that's because parts of the film are in french with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into english from the french. sometimes, characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene! when i tried to get the film to be just subtitled or just dubbed, it made no difference! odd, but still watchable.<br /><br />the story purports to be based on a poe story, though i can't recall which one. in fact, the character of poe appears in the beginning and end of the film--though it didn't look especially like him.<br /><br />a rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home. it seems like an easy bet to win--even if the house is very creepy. however, it can't be that easy, as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died--yet this fool still wants to make the wager! while in the home, he meets lovely barbara steele within and falls madly for her. later, however, he learns that she died more than a decade earlier! how can this be?! i could tell you more about the plot but don't want to spoil any of the suspense. see it for yourself to find out the rest of the story.<br /><br />this film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere. the house, black & white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film. as for the plot, it's interesting--especially because there are many twists and turns--so many that you are wondering just who is and who isn't among the undead by the end of the film.<br /><br />the only negative is that i felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed. crazy as it might sound, i felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary.<br /><br />also, parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity. a strikingly beautiful woman appears topless, but it's hardly necessary for the plot.
