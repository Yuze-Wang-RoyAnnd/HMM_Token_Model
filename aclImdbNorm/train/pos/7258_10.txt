i was lucky enough to get a dvd copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the 2nd time. the 1st time was on late night tv in australia more than 20 years ago but i could never forget this strange and bleak film..<br /><br />not many people like this film at all because it is so unconventional - the fact that there is hardly any spoken dialogue in this move - we just hear the thoughts of characters - is only one unconventional aspect of it.<br /><br />searching for a copy of this film i found out that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, it was not kept in any british tv or film archives, that it was never released on video or dvd, that television networks around the world trashed it after their copyright ran out in the 80's. when it was first shown on tv in australia there were no recordable devices for consumers.<br /><br />on the second viewing recently, i could see why it was unforgettable. at times it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic very like a harold pinter stage play.<br /><br />again, if anyone wants a dvd copy of this please email me and i'm sure we can work something out regards adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
