the directing behind this film was fantastic for a comedy. many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker (visually -- not story wise) than what i expected. granted, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that (compared to others like something about mary or american pie). as you rewatch it, several jokes stand out and get funnier. if you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic book-type movie (batman, x-men, etc.) and liked them, you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie. if you didn't like them, you may like the respectful ridicule that this film has for those. if you did like this movie, the dvd has some cool extras. (8/10)
