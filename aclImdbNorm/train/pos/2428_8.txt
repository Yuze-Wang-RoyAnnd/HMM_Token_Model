as an old white housewife i can still appreciate that laurence fishburne is one of our finest actors. anyone who appreciates his work like in deep cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor. since i think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting. all of the acting is quite good. if you can't take lower manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life (not glorified action shoot-em ups) then this is not a film you would enjoy. it is mr. fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. i would love to see larry and anthony hopkins go at each other some day in a movie.
