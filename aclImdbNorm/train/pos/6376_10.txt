if you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue, and imagination - without the need to break into song every twelve minutes - then this is the disney movie for you! my sons loved every minute of this film, and i have to admit that i laughed out loud many times throughout the movie. there are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right. this should go down as one of the disney "classics" because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non-stop excitement!
