jim belushi is terrific as the "average joe" who gets his 15 minutes in "the twilight zone". michael cane is the mysterious bar tender who not only listens to belushi's "story", but has a "cure" for all of belushi's middle class problems: a magic potion to bring about an avalanche of changes in belushi's life.<br /><br />flashbacks show a 15 year old horribly ashamed of causing his high school baseball team's championship defeat. belushi goes on with his "pitiful life", seemingly happy, but always wondering "what if..." for what seems to be several days, belushi experiences a "different" life, one of enormous success, admired and hated by others in equal measure.<br /><br />this is not quite "it's a wonderful life", but some elements are similar, and very endearing. the "ending" is predictable, but still satisfying. watch for a very young cortney cox in a bit part as "fatal attraction" -like other woman. a very pleasant film!
