i only watched this because it starred josie lawrence, who i knew<br /><br />from whose line is it anyway?, the wacky british improvisational<br /><br />comedy show. i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem. it is uplifting, touching, and<br /><br />romantic without being sappy or sentimental. the characters are<br /><br />all real people, with real foibles, fears and needs. see it.!
