in all honesty, this series is as much a classic (as television goes) as the original poem is to the world's literature. far from being crassly exploitative, it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture's defining texts.<br /><br />i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of troy (which was felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures flitting around on their ankle wings, or poorly-cast fashion models in bikinis. as in homer's work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by classical statuary).<br /><br />it's a pity it's not available in dvd, especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores.
