anton newcombe and courtney taylor are friends, they both are the leads in their own respective bands; anton with the brian jonestown massacre and courtney with the dandy warhols. what's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals; its a love hate relationship. at times you both hear them praising one another, but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are. while the dandy warhols went on the reach commercial success, bjm still was stuck in the underground scene; and for good reason why.<br /><br />the focus of dig! is more towards anton and the bjm, as they have a lot more substance. they are the most dysfunctional band. during gigs they will fight and bash each other. anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly. with the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume, fight was always waiting to happen. you know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens; that's why people would go to their gigs, for the fights. <br /><br />anton is very unstable. always thinking himself as a music messiah, he wants to change music and create a revolution, but he could never get out of the underground. he is a very talented musician, its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill. but his draw back is he cant escape the world he created; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs, alcohol and depression. on the other side, the dandy warhols were having their own troubles. they didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label. but they found huge success in europe. but courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of anton. its interesting that both anton and courtney both had what the other needed. courtney always wanted to be musically talented as anton, though anton wouldn't say it, he needed the commercial success that the dandy's had, to make his revolution.<br /><br />over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands, there is a lot of footage. there is never a dull moment in dig!. it is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say, seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job. ondi timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more. even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure.<br /><br />you wont be disappointed.
