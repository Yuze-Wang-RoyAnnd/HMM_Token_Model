gabe ryan (frankie thomas) gets out of reform school and goes back to the slums. his sister (ann sheridan) does her best to keep him out of trouble, but it just seems to follow him. aside from his associations with the termite gang, gabe is followed by real-life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance. they need someone to blame for the arson, and gabe is it. it is up to the termites to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just desserts.<br /><br />the the scene that introduces the dead end kids is really quite good. the boys wander on over to the new resident's furniture on the street, and proceed to make it their own. they talk to each other in phoney posh accents and talk about drinking tea together; bernard punsley takes a nap in a chair. the boys then proceed to start a fight with the new boy, but after he proves himself a good fighter, they ask him to join their club.<br /><br />the initiation scene is rather good too, filled with mischief that seems dangerous at first, but is really rather clever and innocent.<br /><br />later, when billy halop studies to become the boy mayor, he has a dream about schoolwork. this is wonderfully staged, with tiny holograms of the kids walking on his face and firing questions at him.<br /><br />angels wash their faces is a great title because it plays off of the success of angels with dirty faces, and really tells what the kids are doing. notorious for bad behavior on and off the set, these boys make nice in this film. but rather than seem disingenuous, it makes for some great laughs. this is a preview of what many of the boys would become in the bowery boys series. we even get a few garbled words from leo gorcey.
