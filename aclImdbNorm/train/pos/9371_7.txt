one thing i always liked about robert ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out, it goes in a completely different direction. there are so many twists and turns in this film that i have a sore neck from watching.<br /><br />one thing i also like about director john dahl (kill me again, rounders, unforgettable) is that he can be depended upon to direct and, in this case, write (with his brother rick) a good story.<br /><br />now, add nick cage, dennis hopper, lara flynn boyle, and j.t. walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected. dahl seems to bring out the best in folks, and this will keep you interested, and guessing, until the very end.
