the woman in black (1989) is a tv adaptation of susan hill's modern classic ghost story, published only a few years earlier than the film was made. sadly, this film has not been released on dvd, and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs. it's availability is in direct contrast to it's popularity amongst those in the know about horror films. the story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow, who died on her isolated marshland estate. what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death, and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest. the story is told in a subtle but concise way, never being self-indulgent, flashy or over-expositional. the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach, but it's just what the story needs, and why it works so well. it's what you don't see that scares. having said that, there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual, and it works to perfection. i watched this film during the day, and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later. if you love being terrified, do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black.
