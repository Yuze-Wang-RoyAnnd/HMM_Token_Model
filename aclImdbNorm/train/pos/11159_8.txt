this is a wonderful film... first impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a fun loving display of how men and women's baser motivations diverge (vive la difference !) <br /><br />you can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses. human beings are a bit rubbish really, but we have big hearts and we try our best, despite temptation. it's not our fault when sometimes temptation can't be resisted, that's just who we are.<br /><br />there is a consistent stylishness from start to finish; crisp photography and sharp composition, very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content, well suited music and laugh out loud scripting.<br /><br />watch out for the very young "lone wise voice"... brilliant; wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from the human condition.
