"pet sematary" succeeds on two major situations. first, it's a scary horror movie. those that just aren't produced in these days. second, it's an emotional, clever movie overall. so if you are looking for chills, scares, creepiness and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs, and gruesome effects; this is the movie you are looking for. a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan. <br /><br />probably, the best adaptation to any of king's novels. the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel, but that doesn't means that this underrated movie isn't a complete horror/drama accomplishment. <br /><br />stephen king's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time. the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there's a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it's members. then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title "pet sematary" does not offers appiness!) a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere, now it turns very dark. the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits, but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad, gray, creepy. dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family's entire life, and "pet sematary" proves it dramatically. <br /><br />the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot. sadly enough, the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead. the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it's something much, much worse. what will happened with the lives of our all american family? could pascow prevent this tragedy? what is it with the surreal nightmares? <br /><br />watch "pet sematary" to witness one of the most touching, emotional horror movies of recent times. you won't regret. the acting is very good although i didn't dig the actor who portrayed the father. he didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation. but that's just my opinion. denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble, tender mother. baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts. *shivers*. overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears... the loss of someone you love, the dead returning to life, and a feeling of desperation.<br /><br />something is for sure... i don't wanna be buried, in a pet sematary!!
