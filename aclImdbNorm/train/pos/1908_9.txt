this show is beautifully done. when it first came out i though it nothing more than a light-hearted family comedy with quite a few good one-liners. it seemed to express many families really well too, with different concepts of both parent and child, however, like i said, i never thought any more of it then a good watch on an evening. however, my view was shot out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny john ritter accrued. the programme stood it's ground and really commended the characters life in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admire res of john ritter, a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything. when the show aired after ritters passing, i really wanted to just give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant to me. i thought this shone threw the acting talents of the three children, particularly that of bridget's character, who was worried of the last words she said to him. it reminded me that no matter what horrible things i say to my dad, i don't mean them and it's very important that he knows this. great show
