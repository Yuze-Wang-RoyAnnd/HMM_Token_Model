has anyone noticed that james earl jones is the waiter who is serving when hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake. i watched this movie on a video that i had taped off of the television. when i watched this scene i thought i recognized the voice of jones when the "waiter" laughed at the end. i rewound the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. listen closely as the waiter laughs when hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby, then watch closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter, albeit, quickly.
