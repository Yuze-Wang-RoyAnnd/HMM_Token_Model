okay, so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way, but from the beginning, hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances, and have always been willing to mistakes they've made. they advice people to see newer episodes first, so they can see just how good the show is, and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on-screen. <br /><br />the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show, as the story lines go from strength to strength. the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression, drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way, but that is what star trek is and was all about. it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way, dealing with them subtly and smoothly. <br /><br />yes, they have used some characters from trek history, but they have done them justice - characters like shelby, lefler and necheyev, vastly underused in the show, had a rebirth in the new frontier books, but they lost their sizzle after a while, when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci-fi, and hf shows those characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. <br /><br />the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved. they release bloopers for every episode, so the fans can see what a laugh they have, because they are people doing it in their spare time, with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide-eyed in shock! <br /><br />what this series, now drawing to a close after 7 years, has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same. hf will live for a long time after it ends, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place.
