hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was gene roddenberry's mission. their focus on homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other trek series and movies. the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved, the stories are more complex, and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive. in season 6 episode 1, countermeasures, there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history. the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting. the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters. there are also nods to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know. i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked!
