if you are a fan of zorro, indiana jones, or action in general this is a must-see. directed by republic's ace team of william witney and john english, and starring reed hadley as don diego/zorro, this serial delivers! i won't bore you with the plot (who cares? less talking, more fighting); what really matters here is hadley's superb interpretation of the character/s and the stunt work of dale van sickel and yakima canutt. <br /><br />***stunt spoilers follow ***<br /><br />you can see the influence this film had on lucas and spielberg -- zorro gets caught in the original version of the star wars trash compactor in one chapter, trapped on a rope bridge a'la temple of doom in another, does a raiders horse-to-coach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him, exactly as mola ram does to indy in temple of doom. in addition to all this, the whip action is great as zorro disarms villains, swings to safety, etc. with his trusty lash. most of the sword work is fair to lame, except for chapter one, which features a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by sword/stunt legend ralph faulkner, who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil rodriguez. this was the first serial i ever saw, on matin'ee at the bijou when i was a kid and i have been hooked on them ever since. <br /><br />zorro's fighting legion delivers "z" goods!
