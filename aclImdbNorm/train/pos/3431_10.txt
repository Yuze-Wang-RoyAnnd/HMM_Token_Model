simply the best estonian film that i have ever seen, although it is made by a finnish director ilkka j"arvi-laturi. tallin pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the republic of estonia. but at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many eastern european countries at that time. in the early 90s soviet union fell into pieces and many countries, such as estonia, became independent. now the conditions may be better in most of those countries. but in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the soviet era had left them as inheritance. (and many of them still do...at least on some level...) <br /><br />tallinn pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well-written script. the actors are also very good, especially j"uri j"arvet (perhaps the best known estonian actor, plays snaut in tarkovski's solaris), playing and old gangster who's slowly becoming tired of his way of life. but the most astonishing performance comes from monika m"ager, a child-actor playing terje, a boyish girl in her early teens, whose presence in the plot is quite essential. (and her name is not even mentioned in the imdb-credit list!!!)w<br /><br />there are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time. but tallinn pimeduses does that. unfortenately j"arvi-laturi's other films are far from this kind of achievements. his first one, kotia p"ain was too artificial and his latest, history is made at night was just a weird mess.
