emilio miraglio's "the red queen kills seven times" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed. first of all, and of paramount importance for me, it has a complex, twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end. the story, concerning a series of gruesome murders (you already know how many from the film's title, right?) that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, is an involving one, and the murderer, a red-cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman, is both frightening and memorable. every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses, and here we have quite an assortment, headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of her earlier roles, sybil danning, as a lustful tramp at barbara's fashion house. another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy, hummable score, and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days. gorgeous scenery? check again. filmed largely in wurzburg, germany, the picture is a treat for the eye indeed. ok, ok, but what about those murders? after all, isn't that what gialli are all about? well, i'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings, shootings, impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out...not to mention the crypts, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and lots of 'em, too!), the drug references, a rape scene, the obligatory red herrings and, in the person of ugo pagliai, a hunky leading man for the female viewers. as i said, a perfect giallo. and even better, this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame, and you know what that means: a gorgeous print and loads of extras, to boot! thanks, guys!
