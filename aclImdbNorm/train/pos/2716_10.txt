everything i remember about it was excellent... great cast with sam waterston & george innes (before he became more familiar to us audiences).... excellent scripts as only the english can do - edwardian sherlock holmes/lord peter wimsey/albert campion type mysteries, but with a jules verne twist. sort of like macgyver would have been had it been in england 80 years earlier... right at the beginning of the scientific/technological revolution of the 20th century.<br /><br />i've often wondered if the creators of macgyver saw these shows. macgyver first aired about 3 years later.<br /><br />i still have 1 episode on a much deteriorated tape.
