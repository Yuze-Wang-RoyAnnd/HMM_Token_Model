and my children love it now! granted, i can watch it now and realize the animation wasn't that great, and that the plot is trite. hey, if every villian introduced themselves by saying "i ammmmm daaaarrrkk heeeeaaarrt" i think they might be laughed at, but for young children it is a moral story with catchy music.<br /><br />music so catchy, mind you, that i still had the words memorized after not seeing this film in twenty years. i would definitely suggest this one for younger children.
