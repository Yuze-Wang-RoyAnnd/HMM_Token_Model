this is a pretty ok film... yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient, and the movie doesn't really justify the large star cast (ab, sd, tanuja). however, the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay menon (not to be confused with the singer kk). in the scene where he first meets amitabh's character, i thought that a man who can just look at ab, keep staring and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. in fact, he has proved himself worthy again in sarkar, alongside ab for a second time. this guy should get more roles, he's brilliant.<br /><br />if you've read any of the other reviews here on imdb, you already know the plot, and i do agree that akshaye khanna's entry into pakistan was a little too easy. and the little love angle he shared with "what's-her-face" was completely unnecessary. but he is a fairly good actor (as seen in dch), sunjay dutt is cool to watch, always. and ab... what can i say. i don't know if i'm his biggest fan in the world, but i know i can definitely compete for the spot.<br /><br />an interesting watch, considering it's bollywood, although a bit inspired by hollywood oldies like "the great escape" and "bridge on the river kwai".
