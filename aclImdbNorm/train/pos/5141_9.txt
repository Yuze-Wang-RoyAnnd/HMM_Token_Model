i have to admit, i wasn't expecting much going into this film viewing in my japenese film class, but this film really blew me away. the director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film, truly portraying a picture of madness. i think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness, helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind. this film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs. american, in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy film always with the happy ending, exercising the imagination very little.
