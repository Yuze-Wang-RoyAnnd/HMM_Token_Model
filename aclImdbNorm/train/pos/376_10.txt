spielberg's first dramatic film is no let-down. it's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an african-american woman. it also proves that not all movies that have the african-american ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an african-american director.<br /><br />what i love about this movie is spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book. furthermore, danny glover was excellent as mr. and usually, he's just himself throughout most of his movies. but in this, he completely branches out and is someone else for once. but, the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg. she is excellent as celie. you will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie.<br /><br />now, i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well, and all i can say is: i hope it's about as good as this one is, because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed.
