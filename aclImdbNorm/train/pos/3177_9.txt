adam jones has a brilliant sense of humor. there is nothing i didn't like about this film. cross eyed was beautifully shot. adam does a great job of, not only developing the main characters, but also the minor characters. <br /><br />cross eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there. that you don't have to spend a lot to create something worth watching. there is something to like for everyone. if you've had a terrible roommate. if you've ever picked on a dork in high school. if you've ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have any type of sense of humor at all you will love this film. this is the type of film that will be around for a long time and ends up resurfacing again once adam makes a bigger name for himself. i look forward to adam's future projects.
