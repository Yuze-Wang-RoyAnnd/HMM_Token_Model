saw this movie on its release and have treasured it since. what a wonderful group of actors (i always find the casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film). really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress jacqueline bisset in this role and wallace shawn is always a hoot. the script is smart, sly and tongue-in-cheek, poking fun at almost everything "beverley hills". loved paul bartel's "doctor" and ray sharkey's manservant. this was raunchy and crude, but thank god! unless you're a prude, i heartily recommend this movie. fyi for anyone who likes to play six degrees of kevin bacon, mary woronov & paul bartel were in "rock & roll high school". mary woronov and robert beltran were in "night of the comet" together. they were all three in "eating raoul".
