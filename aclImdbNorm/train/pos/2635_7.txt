my take: a funny take on the lion king, posing as a sequel. surprisingly amusing. <br /><br />surprisingly, "lion king 1 1/2" is actually another funny straight-to-video, that's worth a theatrical treatment. i don't see why disney released this straight to video, and release crappy movies like "chicken little" and "return to neverland" theatrically. those movies are better off seen in the video stores (in the "new releases" area), rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside the theaters.<br /><br />this one is merely a spoof of the first film (although the events in "simba's pride" hasn't taken place yet), on timon (voiced by nathan lane) and pumbaa's (voiced by ernie sabella) point of view. we get to see them make fun of the events in the first film. original voices from the first film, like matthew broderick, woopie goldberg, cheeche martin and robert guillaume, return to their voicing roles from the first film, while julie kavner and jerry stiller give some hilarious comedy relief as timon's mom and grumpy uncle.<br /><br />so doesn't this sound fun. maybe not now, but go watch it for yourself. the fact that it's not that serious in its plot makes it the more enjoyable. it's kinda like mst3000 with timon and pumbaa.<br /><br />video movie rating: ***1/2 out of 5.
