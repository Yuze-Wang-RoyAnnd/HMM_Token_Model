from the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work (richard widmark) stealing from a woman's purse (jean peters), pickup on south street is relentlessly fascinating to watch. partly it's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast, the b&w photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters, and because samuel fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like john (asphalt jungle) huston. in fact, it has the same urgency as the huston film about a heist that goes wrong--but the payoff is not quite as strong.<br /><br />jean peters is excellent as the hard-edged girl whom widmark describes as being "knocked around a lot". she gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro-film in her purse for her boyfriend (richard kiley), something the fbi already knows about. they're on her trail when the theft occurs.<br /><br />thelma ritter adds realism to her portrait of a woman called "moe" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life. she's particularly touching in her final scene with kiley.<br /><br />this one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time. good noir from fox and notable for the performances of widmark, peters and ritter.
