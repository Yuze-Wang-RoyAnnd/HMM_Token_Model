i got hooked on this as apparently abc has licensed this show to pearl tv in hong kong. it caught be my surprise, as it was a break from listening to anything chinese. but i started getting reeled in, as the cast and the story lines are just nyc enough and thoughtful. nothing too unbelievable, though i think it's very very stereotypical of them to write damien as a potential black man with a sheet!!!! that has been the most disappointing aspect. the rest is great and i'm sad to learn on imdb that i can't look forward to watching season 2 when i get back to the us. i'm am just as disappointed as the other commentators that this showed much promise and quality and taste. but just as shows that show characters getting closer, it's probably harder for people to watch if the start watching several episodes in. which is apparently a bit too late for the eager networks.
