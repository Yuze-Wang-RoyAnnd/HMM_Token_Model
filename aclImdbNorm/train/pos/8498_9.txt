this is a wonderful movie with a fun, clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of what's important in life make this a very under-appreciated movie. don't let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this. keaton has wonderful moments and i wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated, because actors like keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy. great movie all around!
