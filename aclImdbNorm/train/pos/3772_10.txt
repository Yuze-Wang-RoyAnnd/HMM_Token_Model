bill and ted's bogus journey is possible the most excellent film i have ever watched. though the acting and scenery etc is poor, who cares. the story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent, the ideas are great as well. i recommend anyone to see this classic. the best part is obviously when they 'melvin' death, i was cracking up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film. this is so much better then the first one, which was great as well. possibly the funniest movie of all time!!!!! i think the best parts of the film however, are when bill and ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo, it was hilarious. rock on bill, ted and eddie van halen, bring out a 3rd film!!
