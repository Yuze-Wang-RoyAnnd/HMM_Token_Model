my wife and i took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the winsome fun of the film. it has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the film and especially hallie kate eisenberg's refrain, "boys are so weird." it's refreshing to see a film that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup. boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly! we enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend, myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out. we had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it. it's clean and delightfully acted by a pre-adolescent cast reminiscent of the tv classic "freaks and geeks". we all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the "freaks & geeks" which didn't survive its first season but sold-out its dvd release. do see it especially if you have boys and you'll find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety! girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say, "boys are so weird!" don't miss it...
