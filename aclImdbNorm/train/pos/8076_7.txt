family is about two families who are after each other's blood.<br /><br />viren sahay (amitabh bachchan) is an underworld don, operates from bangkok. he has a family in india. once by mistake he kills shekhar (akshay kumar). like viren sahay, he also has a family (a brother, wife and parents). aryan (aryaman), shekhar's brother is out to take revenge of his brother's death. he kidnaps viren sahay's family for the same reason.<br /><br />the film has got one turning point (amitabh bachchan). second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs, expression matters more. akshay's minuscule role has also put him at par with amitabh. i didn't understand what bhumika chawala was doing in this movie.<br /><br />there were a few loose points in the script; like; amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot-free in the city. kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague. how can the family of such a big don doesn't have any security cover?
