fatal error is a really cool movie! robert wagner, antonio sabato jr., janine turner, jason schombing, malcolm stewart, and david lewis are in the film. the movie's cast all acted really well. robert wagner played his role good. the relationship between saboto jr. and turner was a nice one. there maybe a big age difference there but they are a unique couple. the two actors really worked together rather well. the music in the film is really good by ron ramin and fits the flick very well. there is a bunch of stuff that happens in the movie which you don't know what is going on and what is going to happen next and this movie keeps you going from beginning to end. if you like robert wagner, antonio sabato jr., and janine turner then watch this excellent movie!
