i saw this movie when i was about 8-years-old and i liked it but it wasn't until i watched it again at the age of 13 that i really understood it for what it is; a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real heart of gold "adopts" a little girl in order to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals. the dog star,charlie b. barkin, is murdered by his formal business partner, carface, (who is absolutely diabolical by the way). his soul then goes to where else but heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his life's time, which charlie, being the sneaky but lovable cad that he is steals and rewinds, sending him back to earth. once back on earth, charlie goes about seeking revenge on the evil carface. this is how he comes upon young anne-marie, the lonely little orphan that can talk to animals whom charlie plans to scam for her talents in order to get back at his enemy carface. but scoundrel charlie actually comes to care for young anne-marie and his plans unfoil as he must make up his mind to do what is right after anne-marie discovers what her "best friend" charlie has really been using her to make money for a new and better dog casino. now he must rescue her from the dreaded carface. i still love this movie even at the age of 22. the idea and plot really are quite different and original from that of many other animated films. i especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once. carface was even better than he was in the all dogs go to heaven sequel. in that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain.
