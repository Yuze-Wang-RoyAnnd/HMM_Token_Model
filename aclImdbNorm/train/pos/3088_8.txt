unfortunately for myself - i stumbled onto this show late in it's lifetime. i only caught a few episodes (about three) before it was cancelled by abc. i loved the characters, and storyline - but most of all the great actors! i was a fan of sex and the city, so i saw two characters i recognized (bridget moynahan was & the character "todd" was "smith jared"), as well as jay hernandez (from carlito's way: rise to power) and erika christensen (swimfan). i enjoy watching young actors get their due, and felt like this show would propel their career further along. i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd, and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime? in the meantime, i'm viewing it on abc's website from the beginning.
