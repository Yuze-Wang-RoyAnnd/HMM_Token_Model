i always look forward to this movie when its on tv. have to get the dvd i guess. the range of different types of people is great. it says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. my favorite character must be mr.aoki. he is so quirky but so full of emotions. it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing. unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to blackpool. would make for the perfect sequel if they had. but i guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened.<br /><br />a very simple and innocent story. he stays loyal to his wife and daughter.<br /><br />i haven't seen the hollywood remake. not sure if i want to. i don't really enjoy jennifer lopez. i think richard gere more matches the original than lopez. i have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent.
