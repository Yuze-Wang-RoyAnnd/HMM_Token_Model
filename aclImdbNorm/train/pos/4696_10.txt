even though this movie is quite old, no matter how many times i watch it, it still makes me laugh. <br /><br />one particular quote in the movie stands out. <br /><br />when danny( joe piscopo) pulls up to the d.a's office & parks in a disabled spot, danny's partner says <br /><br />" can't park here, it's for the handicapped". <br /><br />danny replies " i am handicapped,i'm psychotic".<br /><br />that is one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you watch, it'll make you chuckle.<br /><br />johnny dangerously stands in my top 5 comedy/spoof movies of all time.<br /><br />as an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor peter boyle in the cast. so watch this movie & like myself & many others who have watched it, you'll be hooked.
