rachel mcadams. cillian murphy. wes craven. the dream team. this is one of the best thrillers of 2005. a great plot. a great twist. a great eye candy. this is one of wes craven's greatest movies apart from "scream" and "a nightmare on elm street". this could be the best. the plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple. lisa reisert (mcadams) a struggling hotel manager, boards a late red eye back to la. little does she know that she has been followed by jackson ripner aka jack the ripper (murphy). they have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the secreteary of homeland security who is staying in lisa's hotel. and what does this have to with lisa. well, she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him, if she doesn't ripner will murder her father (brian cox). the twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it. overall, definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005. definitely worth the see.<br /><br />3 1/2 out of 4 stars
