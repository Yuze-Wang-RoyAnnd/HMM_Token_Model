i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting "no, no, no, no! it cannot end here! there are too many unanswered questions! the engagement of the dishwashers? mona's disappearance? helmer's comeuppance? the "zombie"? was little brother saved by his father? and what about the head???????" argh!! then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say, i know it probably wouldn't be true to lars von trier's vision, but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned! granted, it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves. helmer, the doctor you love to hate! i think i have yet to see a more self-absorbed, oblivious, self-righteous character on screen! but, i could overlook a change in actors....i just have to know how it ends!
