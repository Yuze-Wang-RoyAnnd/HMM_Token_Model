most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about; a man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from boston that fateful morning of september 11, 2001. what you probably won't know before seeing this film is this: how that would feel; what do you do with that; and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day? the story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist alan johnson, (don cheadle) and ex-college roommate charlie fineman, (adam sandler) solidifies and begins to take shape. characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact, stay with this story, and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable - and accurate. real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates. the pain inside charlie's soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character
