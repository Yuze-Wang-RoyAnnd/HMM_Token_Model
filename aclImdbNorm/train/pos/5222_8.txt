after chicago, i was beginning to lose all respect for richard gere and then along came the flock. there's just so far a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you, but he proved to me that he's finally gotten hold of his craft and can act with the best of them. clare danes was also super as his "trainee/replacement". some have suggested there was too much unnecessary violence, but i don't see it that way. nothing i saw detracted from the power of this film. i was really shocked i hadn't heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at blockbuster instead. really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action, suspense, thrills, and social consciousness. as good as 7even? well, maybe. and you'll see better acting out of gere than anyone's ever gotten out of pitt.
