i'll admit to being biased when i reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series. i saw this film for the first time in ~2005 on the late night "fear friday" on amc, which often pulls obscure gems like this out of cold storage for new generations. i made it a point to watch the entire amicus anthology series before reviewing any of them here to make sure i had perspective. looking back, i still rate the house that dripped blood as my favorite, followed closely by tales from the crypt and then asylum.<br /><br />i think all of the elements that make this series charming---the vintage '60s/'70s style cinematography, creepy to kooky, far-fetched tales and the utter britishness of it all right down the backing music----came together better here than any of the others overall. the movie centers around a very old english country house and the misfortune that befalls all that dwell within.<br /><br />the first story involves a horror writer and his wife, who moved into this secluded place to get a break from the city so he could concentrate on his passion. he creates a murderous character called dominic and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction. there is a subtle physchedelia here via his torment that i found amusing yet creepy. oh and those horrible prop teeth (then again these are british actors, maybe those were real!!!) <br /><br />the second story is the tale of a lonely old man (peter cushing) that has moved here to escape his loneliness, yet it only worsens as he is haunted by lost love. he seems to have found possible salvation at a local (very creepy) wax museum, but it turns out he would have been much better off alone.......<br /><br />the third story includes the great christopher lee (my fav british horror actor) as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter. he is constantly wary of her getting into things she shouldn't---like witchcraft! she has a natural talent for it, with good reason. lee is superb here as the ice cold disciplinarian, that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth!! but despite his best efforts, the little troublemaker does in fact learn forbidden knowledge and bad things follow......<br /><br />this final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he's working with isn't qualified to capture a proper vampire film, right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular. so he goes to a old curiosity store in the middle of a foggy night to get something more "authentic". little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic vampire's cloak! putting it on at the stroke of midnight has rather noticeable effects. by the time i had gotten to this fourth and final story, it was after 3 am and i couldn't quite stay awake on the first try (not from boredom). but i did experience something that i have hundreds of times, a curious bonding experience i have with films or music when i drift in and out of sleep and the film/music becomes part of my dream!! great fun!! this bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because i woke up right when he was levitated by the cloak's power and couldn't quite comprehend was what happening at first. not long after, the lovely ingrid pitt, a costar on his movie set, came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight---but he needn't have bothered, for she was a real vampire herself. the chintzy keyboard jingle that followed as she flew toward him on the staircase was simply hysterical!! and again in my half-asleep state, seemed rather confusing! side note: make sure to catch lee and pitt along with the stunning amicus star britt ekland in the all time classic film the wicker man (1973). <br /><br />the weakest link here was the interlacing commentary between stories, but based on the stories themselves, this is a classic! objectively, i would say the third story is best, but i like the 4th most because it makes me smile so much.very highly recommended for horror fans and if you're a british horror fan, it's mandatory! i'd say it's worthwhile to view the series in chronological order if you can. the last film of this series, monster club (1980) is certainly the weakest. i think the first 3-4 films except for the at times mediocre torture garden (1967) are the best, but if you like any of them, you should watch them all at least once. you'll probably be back many more times to watch your favorites.
