william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex-wife in "the ex-mrs. bradford," also starring jean arthur, eric blore, and james gleason. it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed. though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple, the actor made a couple of other "thin man" type movies, one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur, both to very good effect.<br /><br />somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty, debonair professional and "the ex-mrs. bradford" is no exception. the ex-mrs. b has mr. b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she's dragged him into. and this isn't the first time she's done that! it almost seems as though there was a "bradford" film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films - mr. b complains that his mystery-writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases. this time, a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line.<br /><br />the solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it's beside the point. the point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex-mrs. b. jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny. however, with an actress who comes off as brainy as arthur does, the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained. i suspect the writer had something else in mind - say, the wacky side of carole lombard. when arthur hears that the police have arrived, she says, "ah, it's probably about my alimony. i've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it," it's more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement. it still works well, and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own.<br /><br />definitely worth watching, as william powell and jean arthur always were.
