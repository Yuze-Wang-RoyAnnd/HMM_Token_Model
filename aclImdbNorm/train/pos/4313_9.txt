grand canyon falls under a very scarce category: it is a very clever film, with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end. i have the impression that it never made it to it's deserved ranking (and never will), because of it's simplicity. this kind of flick needs sensitive watchers. pity thought that imdb makes me write ten lines, because this is in no way necessary in this particular case. anyway in order to fulfill this request, i will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting: not that it is bad but it could have been done much better. exception made for kevin kline who was perfect. go ahead and watch it.
