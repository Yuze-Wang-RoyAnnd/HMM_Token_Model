although i was in this movie playing the part of sheriff hodges, it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me i'm not that easy. you might say that i'm biased about the film, and, ok, i am, but i didn't see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and was extremely pleased. i'm not a horror film fan as such but love the old "b" movies and black and white sci fi films. this movie will make you "think" you know when something is going to happen, then it doesn't, then it does. it will keep you completely off balance. i would suggest watching the movie first then the director's notes and special features. it is so well written, directed and filmed and i can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew. i sincerely hope to be part of brian and laurence's future projects.
