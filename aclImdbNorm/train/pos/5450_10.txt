barbara stanwyck plays lily powers. she's a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a little crummy mining town. he also sells her to men. she escapes to new york and literally sleeps her way to the top.<br /><br />originally i had only seen the 71 minute version but it's pretty extreme--for its time. nowadays it's pretty tame. the movie moves very quickly and has tons of sexual innuendo--some of it comes off as pretty silly (but fun) today. it moves so quickly you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen--even in 1933. there's nothing classic or monumental about this--it's just a quick, gleefully dirty little film that's lots of fun. it only falls apart at the end with a little "moral" ending that the censors demanded. it comes across as unbelievable and stupid (i saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it--one guy quite rightfully said "no way") i just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different, somewhat tragic and much better ending. this version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake! i believe this is the only one in release--but be aware. <br /><br />the acting is good--stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it way over the top. she makes you believe that she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around. there are also strong supporting performances from handsome donald cook and george brent. also look for a pre-stardom john wayne in a hilarious bit as a meek and mild office worker! fun, dirty and fast. i give this a 9.
