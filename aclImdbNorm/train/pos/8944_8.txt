bell book and candle was released in december 1958 and features james stewart, kim novak, jack lemmon. and ernie kovaks. this film had james stewart and kim novak in their second on-screen pairing (after the alfred hitchcock classic vertigo, released earlier the same year). this was stewart's last film as a romantic lead as he was deemed too old at age 50 to play that sort of part anymore. the movie is about a witch played by kim novak who is attracted to a mortal played by james stewart. she puts a spell on him and he falls head over heels in love with her. i enjoyed the movie and its cast. this movie at the time was a moderate success which was nominated for a golden globe for best movie comedy. gimmeclassics
