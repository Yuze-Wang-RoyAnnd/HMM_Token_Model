besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is: 1)stanley kubrick 2)god allmighty 3)the rest... this movie actually is better than the book (and the tv miniseries though this is an easy feat, considering the director). the flawless filming stile, the acting and (kubrick's all time number one skill) the music - make it the masterpiece of horror. i watched the tv miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and i had my hopes about this when i got a hold of it. it blew me away!!! it is far better than i ever imagined it. it starts slow (kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense. the intro scene is a classic by all means and i watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film. also the film doesn't offer a lot of gore (it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that i hate in recent day horror films. just watch it!
