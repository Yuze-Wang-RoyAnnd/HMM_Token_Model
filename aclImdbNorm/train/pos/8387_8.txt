this first part of the brd trilogy has more passion and plot density than lola, but less of the magic of veronica voss. the political musings have point to them: we see the shortages after the war, how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day-to-day life (delicious moment when fassbinder, playing a grifter, tries to sell a complete set of kleist to schygulla, who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth: she really wants firewood).<br /><br />there's some clumsiness in the first hour. the scene in maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by hermann's appearance should go quicker. the train scene when maria meets karl oswald falls flat when she insults the gi--i cringed, it was so bad. but as the story develops and the years go by, i was drawn more and more into this glossy, cold world.
