2054. paris is an escher drawing with people and vehicles scurrying along at multiple levels in an obvious homage to fritz lang's metropolis. paris is both ultramodern and crumbling into decay. and in the blink between surveillance sweeps, a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub. a tough police captain investigates. shown in stark black and white, with the gloomy corridors, shadowy alleys and single source lighting characteristic of the most hard-boiled of film noir, comparisons to sin city are inevitable. but the story owes more to masamune shirow and william gibson than to frank miller, as high tech surveillance, near-invisible stealth suits and ruthless super-corporations are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars. the film never quite generates the doom-laden atmosphere of gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its tech-heavy marginal characters clashing with industrial types from corporations that all seem to have their own ministry of fear, but the viewer definitely gets the sense that future paris is no utopia and future science is less than benevolent. and as the police procedural plot line unfolds we are taken into the darker recesses of individual ambition beneath the shiny veneer of avalon corporation's cultivated pr image. the motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between b&w comic books and next generation rotoscoping, and is either captivating or intrusive depending on your tastes. nevertheless, a great visual sense is on display here, and future paris is filled in down to the tiny details giving the picture a unique look which is in turns both spartan and baroque. worth a look.
