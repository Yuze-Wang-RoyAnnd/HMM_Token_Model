there are movies, and there are films. movies are more often than not merely cinematic "candy," whereas films are true works of art. fraulein doktor is certainly well-placed in the latter. as most viewers, i was highly impressed with the battle scenes, but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film. having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of deutschland, all the while in the throes of morphine addiction, die fraulein is treated very shabbily by the german high command despite all of her efforts. the scene in which the doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a mercedes benz command auto, alone, desolate, and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a "spy's" lot in life. only the emotional pain presented by richard burton in the spy who came in from the cold comes close. fraulein doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing. i only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on dvd so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it can again (perhaps again and again)enjoy this exceptional motion picture.
