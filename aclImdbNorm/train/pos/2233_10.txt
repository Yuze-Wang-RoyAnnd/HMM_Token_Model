i first saw this movie back in the 1980's and now in 2006 this movie still is one of the best movies i have ever seen! i would recommend anyone to look at this movie. you will not be sorry. it is well acted out, so real and never a dull moment. the acting is superb and the location makes the movie seem like you are there. from the beginning right up to the end, this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention. the actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the amazon and it shows how she managed to survive in the amazon all alone. it is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions. this is why this movie is so appealing. the fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming. i find this movie one that i can watch over and over again and one that i never get tired of. this is indeed quite a compliment as i have hundreds of movies! i would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best i have ever seen!
