this is a quite slow paced movie, slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger. the viewer slowly feels that there's something wrong here ...<br /><br />i really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end. it is clever, well paced and very well acted. both philippe toretton and emmannuelle seigner are deeply into their characters. <br /><br />the little son "pierrot" is also very touching.<br /><br />a thriller which does not seem like one. a very unconventional movie, very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes.<br /><br />i'll give it a 8/10 !!
