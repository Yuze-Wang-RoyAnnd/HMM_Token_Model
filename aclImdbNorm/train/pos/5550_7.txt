are highlights of this 1917 feature. the pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. on an island off the coast of scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of "fisher folk." my copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is splendid. maurice tourneur directed pickford in this pleasant film. pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune. pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny. and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. not a great picford film, but still worth seeing. matt moore (pickford was married to his brother, owen moore) is the love interest, and is good as the strapping island lad. leatrice joy is one of the villagers but i couldn't spot her either. my copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. very effective.
