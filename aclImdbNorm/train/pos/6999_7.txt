seven pounds stars will smith as ben thomas, an irs collection agent who has an ulterior motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax payments. thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his, quite frankly, unforgivable crime.<br /><br />the story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window. what you see is exactly what is happening - even the ending of titanic was more surprising when compared to seven pounds. there is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening.<br /><br />normally i only like will smith when is in full bad boys mode. the guy is at his best when sporting a gun, driving a ford gt and saying "aw hell nah" as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for. this is probably the main reason why i wasn't looking forward to the movie, although here he is very understated. there are flashes of comedy but they are subtle, in fact it was the most understated will smith performance i have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award.<br /><br />the supporting cast were all grand too - rosario dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and woody harrelson and barry pepper were fine as where all the other bit players.<br /><br />overall it is a weepy - but it isn't throwing all the usual clich'es and sentimental violins to give you no other choice but to cry. there were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke. you will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more real.<br /><br />i would give it 8/10. the will smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of the pursuit of happiness and comes of all the better for it.
