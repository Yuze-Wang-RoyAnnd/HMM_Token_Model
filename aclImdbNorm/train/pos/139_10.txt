first of all, riget is wonderful. good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. nice combination of strange 'dogma' style of telling the story together with good music and great actors. but unfortunately there's no 'the end'. as for me it's unacceptable. i was thinking... how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse? ...and i have some idea. i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different. i'm sure that 3rd part without helmer wouldn't be the same. so here's my suggestion. mayble little bit stupid, maybe not. i know that lars likes to experiment. so why not to make small experiment with riget3? i think the only solution here is to create puppet-driven animation (like for example "team america" by trey parker) or even computer 3d animation. i know it's not the same as real actors, but in principle i believe it could work... only this way it's possible to make actors alive again. for riget fans this shouldn't be so big difference - if the animation will be done in good way average 'watcher' will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie. the most important thing now is the story. it's completely understandable that it's not possible to create riget 3 with the actors nowadays. so why not to play with animation? and... look for the possibilities that it gives to you! even marketing one! great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation. just dreams?<br /><br />i hope to see riget 3 someday... or even to see just the script. i'm curious how the story ends... and as i expect- everybody here do.<br /><br />greets, slaj<br /><br />ps: i'm not talking about the "kingdom hospital" by stephen king ;-)
