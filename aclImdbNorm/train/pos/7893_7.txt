i guess i'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film. is it one of the best of the "nightmare" series? maybe not, but i had lots of fun with it. freddy krueger reaches his evil, wisecracking potential. since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down, i felt this so-called final installment ("new nightmare" is the real finale) brought the series out of its slump. there are some great nightmare sequences, including one where breckin meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which freddy controls. this is both a highly original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of the dreamscape, hopping around like super mario. and freddy belts out the funny one-liner, "great graphics." and since the movie was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when freddy started controlling the game with the powerglove. anyone who remembers the first 8-bit nintendo remembers the powerglove. <br /><br />the cast is superb. lisa zane is perfectly cast in the lead. i haven't seen yaphet kotto since "the running man," and i think the last time i saw that film was about 5 years ago. he's another great, underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence. and who can forget the cameos? the best one is by johnny depp (from the first "nightmare") playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial. <br /><br />the 3d sequence at the end is really awesome! so for those who are looking to check this film out--please rent or buy it on dvd! hopefully all the editions come with the 3d glasses, but i'm sure the video edition has the 3d element removed. <br /><br />i personally didn't see many things wrong with the film. it even elaborated on freddy's backstory. the film is a great mix of humor and scares, and the gross-out effects are terrific. could this have given better justice to the franchise? of course it could have. but rachel talalay did a fine job. and finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done.<br /><br />and in closing, i loved the montage over the opening credits. fans of the series will be delighted, and will look at it as a tribute to beloved freddy. <br /><br />my score: 7 (out of 10)
