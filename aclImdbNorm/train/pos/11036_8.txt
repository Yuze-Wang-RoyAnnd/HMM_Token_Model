a prison cell.four prisoners-carrere,a young company director accused of fraud,35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation, daisy,a 20 year-old mentally challenged idiot savant and lassalle,a 60 year-old intellectual who murdered his wife.behind a stone slab in the cell,mysteriously pulled loose,they discovered a book:the diary of a former prisoner,danvers,who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century.the diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape."malefique" is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films i have seen this year.the film has a grimy,shadowy feel influenced by the works of h.p. lovecraft,which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere.there is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well-developed.it's a shame that eric valette made truly horrible remake of "one missed call" after his stunning debut.9 out of 10.
