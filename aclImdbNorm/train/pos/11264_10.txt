this was one of the funniest and informative shows that i have ever seen. this is a must see for anyone over the age of 16. this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning. i don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that mr wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance. if mr wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the georgia dome to hold all the people who will want to see it. i agree with the idea of making this a hbo series. it would have an amazing following
