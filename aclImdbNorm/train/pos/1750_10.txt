well let me just say something about these actors, they really were a good decision, and from experience, having actors really brings the dialogue to life. if you walk into this even fifteen minutes late, you'll be in for a shock, the movie will have already began. you don't want to miss the first few jokes, assuming you came to not miss any jokes.<br /><br />wow! i have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending. not to be harsh, i mean i loved it, but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped! but i'm getting ahead of myself, lets start with the very start of it, when it began. the plot outline goes like this, there is this man, and not to give away any spoilers, (*spoiler alert!!*) (he hasn't had any sex ever(!) they use this plot device to set the story moving, and there are (intentionally or not, it could go either way) some funny situations had by the main characters, some containing irony, and jokes, and awkward situations, you know.<br /><br />the director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog, some music, and jokes to make a funny movie, designed as a comedy, where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between. i went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what i already knew about it, and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy. ten stars!!!
