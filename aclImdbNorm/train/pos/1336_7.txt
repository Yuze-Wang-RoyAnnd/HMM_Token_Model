this is a generally nice film, with good story, great actors and great songs. the cinematography was unfortunately bad. one of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman. why? does it hurt to attempt some originality, abbas? mustan? anyone?<br /><br />the film is about a newly married couple, raj and priya (salman - rani). priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother, who will carry their child. they pick madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by preity zinta. the film is not really realistic, i mean, isn't it easier to adopt? and even if they pick a girl, does it mean the man has to sleep with her? have you heard of insemination? anyway, i guess if the writers had heard of all this, the film wouldn't have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional.<br /><br />salman acts very well. it's nice to see him playing a serious character. but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman. come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. rani is just about ok; she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by preity zinta.<br /><br />the film belongs to preity, who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance. she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally. she lives the film, emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. this is one of her career-best performances. there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries. she just should do more such roles.<br /><br />the film's ending only highlights what i said above. it is tear-jerking, exciting and very well-acted. watch it for preity.<br /><br />7/10 for the film! 10/10 - for preity!
