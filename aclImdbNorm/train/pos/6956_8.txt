i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute. it had all the "sex" content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra, chemistry. uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene . both seem to create this odd, twisted and interesting relationship with powerful "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore. anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other's roles perfectly and even wanda sykes' rather small role will keep you laughing. though these kind of comedies aren't for everybody, but i have to say i went with a person that doesn't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy. this movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are little too...well lets say adult for younger viewers. all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie, tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film.
