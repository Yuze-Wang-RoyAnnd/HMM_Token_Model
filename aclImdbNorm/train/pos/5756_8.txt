anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of elk hills. the town elders deputize tough, cagey vietnam veteran aaron (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by kris kristofferson) and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place. the plan goes sour when aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over elk hills after they get rid of all the bad elements. it's up to aaron's decent do-gooder brother ben (amiably played by jan-michael vincent) to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand. writer/director george ("miami blues," "gross pointe blank") armitage whips up a delightfully amoral, cynical and wickedly subversive redneck drive-in exploitation contemporary western winner: he expertly creates a gritty, no-nonsense tone, keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout, and stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb (the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring). the first-rate cast of familiar b-feature faces constitutes as a major asset: victoria principal as ben's sweet hottie girlfriend linda, the fabulous bernadette peters as flaky saloon singer little dee, brad dexter as the feckless mayor, david doyle as a slimy bank president, andrew stevens as an affable gas station attendant, john carpenter movie regular charles cyphers as one of the 'nam vets, anthony carbone as a smarmy casino manager, john steadman as a folksy old diner owner, paul gleason as a mean strong-arm shakedown bully, and dick miller as a talentless piano player. moral: don't hire other people to do your dirty work. william cronjager's slick cinematography, gerald fried's lively, harmonic hillbilly bluegrass score, and the abundant raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this unjustly neglected little doozy.
