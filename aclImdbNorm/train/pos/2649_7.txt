walking with cavemen, hosted by alec baldwin, is a look back at all the hominid (that's us!) species of the past 5 million years: who they were, what they were like, and how they died out. along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species, walking with cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human. i waited several weeks to watch this, and i was not disappointed.
