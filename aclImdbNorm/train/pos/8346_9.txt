i just watched i. q. again tonight and had forgotten how much i love this movie. it is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world. i love the allusions to mozart all throughout from the opening with "einstein" playing "twinkle, twinkle little star" on the violin to him humming eine kleine nachtmusik during the iq testing of the ed walters. i love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, an especially unique situation for the 1950's, the time in which this movie is set. (i myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children, so please don't think i am some staunch women's libber.) it's wonderful how a man who is "only a grease monkey" is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as catherine's fiance, a clinical behavioral researcher. the message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels. there are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.<br /><br />i did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. in the scene when ed walters is to speak at symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge. in the next camera shot, there only 2. in the credits on our video, it lists tony shaloub's character as bob watters, not bob rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on imdb.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie. it may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. not only that, what a great cast is assembled here. watch it and enjoy!
