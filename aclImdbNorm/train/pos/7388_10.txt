the 74th oscars was a very good one. whoopi's work as emcee was very funny, and light. i personally loved her last apperance, which garnered some frigid reviews due to coarse language and salacious jokes, but that's fine. the audience seemed to like it. halle berry, denzel washington, ron howard, woody allen, and sidney poitier made this an oscar telecast to remember.<br /><br />
