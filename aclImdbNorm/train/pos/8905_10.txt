old horror movies are interesting, plenty of screams, plenty of shouts, and plenty of humor to go along with it. "the blob" is a classic in it's own work. steve mcqueen(1930-80) plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town. going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens. but when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky, he ends up being the victim, and steve helps him out the best he can. when its up to teen power, this movie really provides it. i know most teens have had their hardships when they act up, when danger comes around, they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity. when the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about "the blob" running amok, they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them. the oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day, and in my opinion i think it was jell-o! when everyone pitches in to stop the menace, the town is once again safe, thanks to good old cooperation. i still eat jello and watch this movie all the time, if you don't like jello, tough! rating 5 stars
