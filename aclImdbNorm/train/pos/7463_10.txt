it does seem like this film is polarizing us. you either love it or hate it. i loved it.<br /><br />i agree with the comment(s) that said, you just gotta "feel" this one.<br /><br />also, early in the film, tom cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by monet--an impressionist painter. monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. cruise mentions that the painting has a "vanilla sky". i believe this is a hint to the moviegoer. this movie is like that impressionist painting. it's impressionist filmmaking! and it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting.<br /><br />this is not your typical linear plot. it requires more thought. there is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on. but at the end, all is explained.<br /><br />you will need to concentrate on this movie but i think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it. after it ends is when you should think about it. if you try to figure it out as it's unfolding, you will overwhelm yourself. just let it happen..."go" with it...keep an open mind. remember what you see and save the analysis for later.<br /><br />i found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique, wildly creative, and spellbinding.<br /><br />but i will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it. it appeals to a certain taste. if you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provoking, challenging, spiritual movies, then see it. if you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it.<br /><br />but if you do like what i described, then you will surely enjoy it.
