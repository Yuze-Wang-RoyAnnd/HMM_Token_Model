my school's drama club will be putting this show in the spring of 2002, and i can only hope we're as good as this! i watched this film recently as sort of "research" for my role (rosie alvarez), and i'd just like to say, vanessa williams is the coolest!<br /><br />wow! the casting for this movie was right-on (with one exception). jason alexander, oh my gawd, is there anything he can't do? he was the most wonderful albert peterson ever - i especially loved all of his funny facial expressions and dancing during "put on a happy face!" he is so great! vanessa williams, as i said before, is the coolest. she was a beautiful rosie, and her transition from secretary to seductress was totally believable. tyne daly was hilarious as albert's obnoxious mother and george wendt was superb as the annoyed mr. mcafee (however i loved paul lynde's performance in the 1963 version!). brigitta dau cracked me up as ursula merkle; she really hammed it up! and marc kudisch was an awesome conrad birdie..."suffer!"<br /><br />there was only one casting that i didn't understand, and, as you'll see from previous comments, many other people didn't understand. chynna phillips as kim mcafee - what was that? i mean she's really pretty and very talented, but...she looks a bit too old for the role. eh, maybe i'm delusional.<br /><br />okay well anyways, i highly recommend this movie. it'll leave you smiling!<br /><br />
