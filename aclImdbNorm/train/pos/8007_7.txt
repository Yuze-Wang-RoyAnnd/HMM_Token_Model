this game is very addictive, i kept playing it for hours straight until late at night but also the fact that you can't save a game when you are in space contributed to this, at times i just had to play on in order not to loose any game data.<br /><br />so yes, "freelancer" is addictive but also quite flawed. also for instance, something that extremely bothered me was that you couldn't skip any of the cut scene's with as a result that at times you had to watch the same few minute cut scene time after time. a great opportunity for me to multitask to check my e-mail or have a chat with my friends and more things like that, while i had to wait for the cut scene to be over.<br /><br />the story starts of promising but the further you get the more ridiculous it all gets. also the game also ends quite abrupt, at least it did so for me. it is quite obvious that they are hinting at a upcoming sequel. i don't know if a sequel is in the works at the moment but i am sure that most likely i will pick one up once it will be released.<br /><br />the gameplay is very easy! even for those who are not familiar with flight games. to put it boldly, every fool can play this game. yes, some levels are quite hard and require lots of effort. it took me about 1-2 weeks for me to finish this game which might be a bit too short. but thank god for the multi-player option! it allows you to keep playing short missions, just like the single player game once you have completed it by the way.<br /><br />even though lot's of mission are the same, it just simply stays cool to be in the middle of the at times massive dogfights.<br /><br />the graphics are good but just not anything revolutionary or anything.<br /><br />addictive game but beware of its flaws.<br /><br />7/10
