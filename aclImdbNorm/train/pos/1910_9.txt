ya. that is what i think. sure it was still a great show with john in it but i personally think that it is way better without.<br /><br />i love having c.j. and grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together.<br /><br />when john was still around i really didn't laugh as much as i do now.<br /><br />it is too bad that no more are being made. ( i don't think...) because i would love to see some new material.<br /><br />my favorite character must be rory. poor rory is almost always left out. it is always about bridget or carrie. what about rory!!!??? honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it. i almost guarantee you will laugh. well even chuckle.
