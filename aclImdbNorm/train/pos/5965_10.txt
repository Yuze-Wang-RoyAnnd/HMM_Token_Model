i gave this a 10 out of 10 points. i love it so much. i am a child of the 80s and totally into heavy metal for many years. those are the reasons i like this movie so much. its so cool to see those posters in the bedroom of that boy (judas priest, lizzy borden, raven, twisted sister...)and his vinyl collection(unveiling the wicked by exciter, rise of the mutants by shock metal master impaler and killing is my business by megadeth). also the soundtrack by fastway is totally incredible and fits very well with the plot. if you are into metal, then trick or treat is your friend. don't buy or watch this movie for ozzy or gene simmons because they are in the movie for seconds, watch it because the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory 80s. you will not be the same person after.
