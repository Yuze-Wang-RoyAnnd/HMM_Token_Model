forget neo and bourne and all those half-baked made up modern heroes. they only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes. since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones, hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick.<br /><br />however, their " action set-pieces " are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question. this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years. for better ( rocky, rambo ) or worse ( die hard 4 - where john mcclane, brace yourselves.... had no beard !! )<br /><br />i say it is high-time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end. this " largo winch " movie is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action-hero. and the only one time where he was weakened is when m'elanie thierry shaved his beard ! i rest my case.<br /><br />i didn't know it when i entered the theater room, but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade. for the first time in france since belmondo, can a movie be both well- crafted and rooted in b-genre without blushing over its performance. in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience... in other words it was " le pacte des loups " or " dobermann " ( i like dobermann, mind you )... i believe " largo winch " has what it takes to be both popular and quality film-making.<br /><br />i exited the theater room very pleased, and hungry for more.
