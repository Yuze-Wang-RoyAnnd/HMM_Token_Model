i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting. the writing was top-notch. james arness is a great actor and he showed it here. brian keith was too old to be davy crockett, and can anyone really play davy but fess parker?<br /><br />another great actor in this move was raul julia, who gave depth to santa anna, a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent times.<br /><br />while some may think the movie was slow-paced, it captured the battle as it unfolded, lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror.<br /><br />what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in. in this day and age when nobody stands for anything, i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time.
