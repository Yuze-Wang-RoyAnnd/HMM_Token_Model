fascinating i approached i am curious (yellow) and it's companion piece with great trepidation. i'd read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex. what i got wasn't this, but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other. i sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was `lame' or `boring' approached the film as if it were pornography. perhaps this is pornography, assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses, but it is intentionally un-erotic. lena, the protagonist, throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring. her breasts may be saggy, her nipples unusually large, her thighs fat, and her face, chubby. but by the end of the film, the audience comes to identify with her, and accept her faults as human. this touch gives her even more believability out necessity. had the director cast a briget bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified. i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece. be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film. the patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream.
