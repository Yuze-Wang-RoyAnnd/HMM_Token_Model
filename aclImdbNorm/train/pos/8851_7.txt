while the title "before the devil knows you're dead" comes from an irish proverb the film plays out like a greek tragedy. it all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they've gotten themselves into.<br /><br />the cast is well-assembled with philip seymour hoffman & ethan hawke playing the aforementioned brothers. notable support includes albert finney as their father and marisa tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other. beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable.<br /><br />the story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve. the narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts. that being said, the film's unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy, through and through. all in all, a pretty impressive debut for first-time screenwriter kelly masterson.<br /><br />sidney lumet's direction is well handled but i'm more impressed by the fact that he's still directing at over eighty years old. i was less impressed by the score by carter burwell but it isn't a major distraction.<br /><br />in the end, the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story & presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience.
