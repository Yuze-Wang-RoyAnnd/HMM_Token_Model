it's only 2 episodes into a 5 part drama, but i can already state that this is one of the best things i've ever seen. that's on tv, silver screen or even in real life.<br /><br />as a writer, it's so good it's almost demoralising! as a viewer it's so entertaining that i'm annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday. it's clear that all these negatives are actually positives.<br /><br />i'm a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas. in comparison to movies, tv dramas always seemed to be dated, quite tame, and well, generally boring! "five days" has really brought tv drama into the 21st century, so for me at least, it's mind changing. go watch it.
