after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie, i was doubtful of giving it a go, but i had lb3.99 in my wallet & thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie & saw this and gave it ago & i'm glad i did, i enjoyed it. directed by the star of films such as chain reaction, the ring, bourne identity,(brian cox) i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it weren't at all, i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spider-man 2 the character doc ock. he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film. of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthew's name, and that made me get it! and no his part isn't big at all, it's very short at the very end of the film, it's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film. i suggest you give it a go. some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing, the acting, and a bit more action. but it's watchable.
