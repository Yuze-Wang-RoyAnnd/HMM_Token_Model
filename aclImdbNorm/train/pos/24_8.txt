although this was obviously a low-budget production, the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing. one of walken's few musical roles to date. (he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well - watch for the cartwheel!) also starring jason connery. a great children's story and very likable characters.
