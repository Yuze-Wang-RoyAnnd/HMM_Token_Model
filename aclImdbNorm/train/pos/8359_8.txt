bertrand blier is indeed l'enfant terrible of french cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public. filmed with his fave duo (depardieu and dewaere) and the usual dose of sex (miou-miou plays her typical role, at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best french actress ever). in first "les valseuses" is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals. those who only are satisfied with family life, or simply know nothing more, the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that, it just let you think of all the usual things in life (working for the car, being bounded at work etc.). it's a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we're living in. great job and it just makes you wish two things : dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course depardieu, he'd better should have stuck with french movies as he proves here that no one can beat him. timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some...
