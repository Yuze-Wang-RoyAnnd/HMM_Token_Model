this was without a doubt the best of the "dirty harry" series. from the opening credits, you're swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing. sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. eastwood has many "aside" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show harry at his bad-assed best. loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles, this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective/action flicks. this is the one dirty harry flick that's raw and devoid of any "fluff". i can watch this again and again (okay, not in one sitting) because it's a gratifying "out for revenge" yarn. the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable. "go ahead - make my day...you feel lucky, punk? ...." classic eastwood as only eastwood, with his anguished, rubbery expressions, and whispery, menacing voice can do it.
