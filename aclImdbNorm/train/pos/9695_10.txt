some people might call "paulie" a kids' movie, but i wish to assert that it's more than that. probably more than anything else, this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the united states - topical given the recent debates. portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor (tony shalhoub) of how he searched america for his original owners, the movie tells several stories. there's the elderly woman (gena rowlands) whom he befriends, then a mexican immigrant (cheech marin), and others.<br /><br />all in all, it's a very well done movie. i usually don't expect much from these sorts of movies, but this one is a treat. i certainly recommend it. also starring jay mohr, buddy hackett, bruce davison, hallie eisenberg and trini alvarado.
