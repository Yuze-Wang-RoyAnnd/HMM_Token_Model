i was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film, which was shot on location in alaska. although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. and their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. the hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating. spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times. there was no cast listing, which reinforced the documentary flavor. the film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. the introduction stated that except for the white traders and the royal mounted canadian police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. the two leading characters, played by mala and lotus long, were eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. but they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have hollywood careers. all in all, the film is definitely worth a look.
