this film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for tv, but it is one of the best movies i've seen. the film and its actors won several awards. it is gripping, fascinating, and it will absorb you completely. the story of a chase for a killer in iron-curtain russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction -- but it's ostensibly a true story. i highly recommend it.
