wow. uhm...well...wow! i guess i'll start with the plot. a betrothed woman (lucy) arrives at the family home of her would be husband (mathurin) in france, where they are awaiting the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or someone in the catholic church to marry them (to satisfy a will.) while waiting, young lucy learns about a legend of a beast who roamed the grounds centuries before. in bed that night, she begins fantasizing about the beast and his rape-turned-consensual tryst with the former lady of the house. that's where it gets interesting! the plot is really pretty thin (and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick), but the filmmaker rewards (?) those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale.<br /><br />this movie isn't for everyone. if you're looking for great cinema, look elsewhere. if you're looking for a far-out movie about bestiality (that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject) this movie is for you! (if you have a weak stomach, don't be afraid of this one. outside of some horse-on-horse action at the beginning, the 'deeds' are pretty cartoonish, imo)
