i had never heard of robert roy macgregor before "rob roy" came out, but the movie is definitely worth seeing. playing the title character, liam neeson brings the same spirit to the role that he brought to oskar schindler, and jessica lange also does a really good job as his wife mary. archibald cunningham (tim roth) is one person very likely to make your skin crawl.<br /><br />all in all, this comes out as good as "braveheart" (maybe even better). i laugh when i think of how hollywood released two movies almost back-to-back taking a swipe at england. very good. also starring john hurt, eric stoltz, brian cox and jason flemyng.
