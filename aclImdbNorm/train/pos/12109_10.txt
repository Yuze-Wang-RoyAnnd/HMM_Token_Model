yaitate!! japan is a really fun show and i really like it! it was shown in our country just recently in hero tv and abs-cbn every 5:30. it is about azuma kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream to make japanese bread that will represent his country. he is working in the southern toyo branch of pantasia and he is also helping his friend (tsukino azusagawa) along with other bakers (like kawachi kyousuke and kanmuri shigeru) to beat st. pierre and take control of pantasia. they fight other skillful bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different kinds of bread but also learn to cook other food. it is a really funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime(like naruto, detective conan and one piece)and famous people from real life. it is one of the best works of takashi haschiguchi and is really a must-see for people of different ages.
