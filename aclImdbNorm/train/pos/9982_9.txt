i saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in canada (still only in limited release). it was worth the wait and then some. i am a very avid reader of margaret laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film. i actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel. i liked that the character of bram shipley was a bit less harsh, and that there seemed to be more of a love story between hagar and bram, which made the scenes at the end of bram's life that much more moving. the loss seemed stronger. hagar was not any more likable on film than in the book, but ellen burstyn was a genius in this role. she was hagar through and through. christine horne was brilliant and has many more great things ahead i am sure. her scenes with cole hauser were electrifying. i could go on and on, overall a 9 * out of 10. fantastic and can't wait for it to come out on dvd, a must own for my collection!
