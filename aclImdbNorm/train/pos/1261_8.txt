i really liked this film. all three stars(connery,fishburne and underwood) give credible performances;and harris is enjoyably over the top. the lighting and shot angles in some of harris' scenes make his face look truly diabolical. the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting. not a great movie, but an enjoyable one. i gave it 7 of 10.
