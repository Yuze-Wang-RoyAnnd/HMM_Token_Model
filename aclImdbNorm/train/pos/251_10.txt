'had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli'. such was ned's bravery.<br /><br />in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised. in greta he is still a hero, the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in mansfield they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there.<br /><br />many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged, to the post office he held up in jerilderie. a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones' hotel, the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visited.<br /><br />evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over victoria, in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning. none of this is wrong, and whats left out would further justify neds actions. the horse that ned 'stole' was actually stolen by wild wright (the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail). ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it.<br /><br />the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before. it is not self justification it is ned's biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. so go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for.
