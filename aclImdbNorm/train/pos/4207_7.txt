skip mccoy (richard widmark) pick-pockets candy's (jean peters) wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the communist cause. she is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact. however, skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and joey (richard kiley) and candy who want the microfiche back. skip can only be traced through moe (thelma ritter) who sells information on criminals. it is made clear to skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film, but he intends to hold out for a high price. this leads to joey hunting after him and a conflict between joey and jean, who has fallen in love with skip. joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. <br /><br />its a well-acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away. its a bit unrealistic how jean peters immediately falls in love with widmark, but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from joey. its a good film.
