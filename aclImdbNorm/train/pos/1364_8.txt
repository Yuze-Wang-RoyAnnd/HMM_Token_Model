i remember parker posey on "as the world turns" before she became the queen of the independent movies. in this film, posey shows her potential as a top fledged actress. in this film with supporting cast that includes omar townsend as moustafa, a lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel salesman on the street, who aspires to become a teacher. the supporting cast features a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and only family relative as judy, the librarian who is old fashioned, dedicated and menopausal. posey as mary learns that she has to grow up and mature. losing her librarian clerk position makes her realize how much she misses it as a place in her life. mary's life is surrounded by friends in the lower east side village of new york city before it became gentrified with yuppies. this film is quite good for an independent and i have come to enjoy parker posey as mary as well as other characters in other films.
