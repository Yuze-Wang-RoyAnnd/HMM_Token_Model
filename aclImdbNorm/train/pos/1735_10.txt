miss decarlo's starring debut has everything the writers could come up with -- from the franco-prussian war to the us civil war, the great american west, san francisco in its heyday, ballet, opera, vaudeville, stage coach bandits, and a chinese junk. just when you thought the plot couldn't get any screwier, it does. it's magnificent, taken tongue in cheek. decarlo's character (here called anna marie -- not salome, that's the role she dances) is loosely based on the career of the notorious lola montez, who was the mistress of the king of prussia and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels. she did escape to the american west. there is a town in arizona called "salome, where she danced," based on the historical fact that lola montez did dance the role of salome there. stagecoach cleve and the russian nobleman who fall under her charms are not historically accurate, nor i assume is the chinese wise man with the scottish accent -- but it is one of my favorite all time camp classics and decarlo is breathtakingly beautiful throughout.
