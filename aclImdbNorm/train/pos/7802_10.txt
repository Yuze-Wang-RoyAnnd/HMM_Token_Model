i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984. steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. i didn't when finally in south africa in 1993. it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty. when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel' iafrika, my hair stood on its ends. there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples.
