fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of hip-hop culture. it is just as funny as this is spinal tap, if not funnier. the actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb. mark christopher lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films. this film is a true cult classic!
