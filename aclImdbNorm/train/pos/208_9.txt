the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two ex-vaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each other.<br /><br />the comic genius of two masters at work, george burns and walter matthau are stellar! some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things! the material is fast-paced and witty, appealing to all ages.<br /><br />mild spoiler alert: there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft, sincere, tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success, are each other.<br /><br />if anyone loves the odd couple, you'll adore this movie. an excellent film!
