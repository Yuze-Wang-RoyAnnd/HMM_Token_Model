this is a really heart-warming family movie. it has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it like that) as well (just think about the dog in "how the grinch stole christmas"... it was plain bad training). the paulie story is extremely well done, well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too. not more to say except that this is a great movie!<br /><br />my ratings: story 8.5/10, acting 7.5/10, animals+fx 8.5/10, cinematography 8/10.<br /><br />my overall rating: 8/10 - big family movie and very worth watching!
