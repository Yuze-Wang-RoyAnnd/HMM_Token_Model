the title of this film nearly put me off watching it. not being a manchester united fan, the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting, however i put my prejudices behind me and i'm glad i did.<br /><br />i wasn't expecting much of a film, but i was pleasantly surprised. the film sped along with me never looking at my watch and i enjoyed every second of the film. if you liked east is east then you'll love this film. ok so the storyline is nothing new, and the classic storylines are contained within the film but it's all done very funnily, and with a breath of fresh air. the film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained. the occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour, and best of all it's a good british comedy.
