this is one of the best animated movies i've ever seen in my life. this isn't just a fun movie, or a well-made movie. this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren't, just the technical skill that went into making it, would grant it a place in the history of animation.<br /><br />wladyslaw starewicz created a stop-motion movie about the secret life of beetles. he imagined a coherent world of insects, with jobs, houses, nightclubs, movie houses, even little props like posters and bicycles and paintings.<br /><br />in this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge. mr. beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly, much to the chagrin of a grasshopper; but he's a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling. mr. beetle returns home and finds mrs. beetle having her own affair. mr. beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife. the two make up and go out to the movies. and the movie they watch is mr. beetle and the dragonfly. described thus it sounds banal, but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema. along with emile cohl and jiri trnka, wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work. for that reason he must not remain forgotten.
