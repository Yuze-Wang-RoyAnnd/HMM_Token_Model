i saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on dvd. recently, i watched several of the reality series on pbs about ranching, etc. none of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does. based on real reality, pulling no punches, bleak, happy, tragic and enlightening, this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life. fine acting on the part of both rip torn and conchata ferrell add to an well done script. the opening credit states that it was done though funds supplied through the national endowment for the humanities. if this is the kind of product taxes could go to i would be happy to see more. i highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film.
