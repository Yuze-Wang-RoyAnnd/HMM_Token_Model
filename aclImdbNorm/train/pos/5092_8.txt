i thought king solomon's mines was beautifully done. my only reservation was alison doody. her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period, and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors. i thought patrick swayze was an excellent choice for alan quatermain. it was nice seeing a seasoned, rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired, fair skinned actors like val kilmer, brad pitt, etc. he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie. this version cannot be compared with the 1950's version with stewart grainger. it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie. i thought both quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated. i am looking forward to seeing this once more, and i hope patrick swayze will again look to these type of roles.
