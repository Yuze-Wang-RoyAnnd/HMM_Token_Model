this is a musical adaptation of dicken's "oliver twist". for the most part, the original story has been maintained, though for the flow of the film certain subplots (such as the summer he spent recuperating and the half-brother) are omitted. the biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book, fagin is hanged--an ending very different from this musical film.<br /><br />this is a one of a kind musical--one whose style and scope really hasn't been matched before or since. not only are the songs often quite singable and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold. whereas in most musicals a few people or perhaps even a small group are choreographed dancing, here the numbers often run into the hundreds or perhaps more. it's truly a sight to see and i was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and is one of my earliest childhood memories. having just seen it again a few moments ago, i would have to say that the film only got better over time. great sets, wonderful acting and singing--this is a special treat that is hard not to love.<br /><br />by the way, when i saw the film again tonight, i was surprised by just how high and feminine mark lester's singing was for the film. well, according to imdb, his singing was dubbed by a girl and this would definitely account for his voice.
