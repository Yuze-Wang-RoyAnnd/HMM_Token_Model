cashing in on the "demons-meets-clergy" trend of the late '60s/early '70s that most prominently included the triptych of "rosemary's baby," "the exorcist," and "the omen," "the sentinel" is an addition that's just as good (albeit the most overlooked of the lot). in a way, it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of polanski's "the tenant" (which came out the same year) for good measure. a new york model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss-coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale; she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor (the brilliant burgess meredith), plus the other off-center tenants. kept awake by loud noises above her apartment, she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building. from there, director michael winner ("death wish") kicks this supernatural thriller into gear, and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine. aided by a brilliant ensemble cast, a subtle storyline, and excellent makeup fx by dick smith ("the exorcist"), "the sentinel" is a genuinely creepy horror flick.
