sure, it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny, but at least the filmmakers didn't try. while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity, this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it. the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film, and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules. most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. i was kind of annoyed by jason priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock, but then again, it's a tv movie! despite all of the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. however, it was nice to see tucson, arizona prominently featured in the film.
