wow, it's been years since i last saw this movie. watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986. initially i didn't' think i would make it through the movie. hunt stevenson (michael keaton) was so obnoxious, arrogant and disrespectful that i found it hard to watch him. he embodied every negative stereotype of americans. if that wasn't bad enough, once the small american town's finest workers were shown the image only got worse. on the opposite spectrum the japanese were presented as emotionless, robotic workaholics. the movie wasn't even all that funny, i only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it. and i'm glad i continued the watch.<br /><br />just like boxing, judges are swayed by how you finish the round. this movie went from about a three up to the seven i rated it because of the ending. the end was excellent. you always want a harmonious ending and this was just that. it was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory, but what was most special was the marriage between the japanese customs and values and the american customs and values. it was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note.
