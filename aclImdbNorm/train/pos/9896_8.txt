i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months. i was actually surprised at how good it was.<br /><br />the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty. they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned.<br /><br />a few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.<br /><br />at the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. but, marty is in the hospital with severe burns. although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />the acting is terrible but that is fine.<br /><br />i love the story. i really sympathize with marty. it's like tamara (2005). the bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.<br /><br />i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers.<br /><br />i give this movie 8 stars out of 10. good cheesy slasher!
