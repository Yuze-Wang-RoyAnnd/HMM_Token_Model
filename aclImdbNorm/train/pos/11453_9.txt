the filmmaker inhaled andy goldsworthy's art, his search for closeness with the land and the water, and his sense of proportion -- and so gently, so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us. "rivers and tides" loves goldsworthy's work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world, a world that hides its power in plain sight. see this movie!
