what a wonderful movie, eligible for so many labels it never gets: science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated, cultured audience.....the kind of english language movie only done in pre-1960 england (and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever done in the usa.<br /><br />main characters in the man in the white suit(1951) starring sir alec guiness and joan greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, science reference words like "polymer" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like "long chain molecules" and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.<br /><br />the man in the white suit (1951) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now (2009) dominate world cinema, and certainly dominate major usa cinema.......it's a carefully acted, intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated english actors (who play educated, accomplished people), and it's all done with comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony which ancient greek dramatists would have approved of.<br /><br />everybody should see this movie, and someday, somehow, some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.<br /><br />it's wonderful.
