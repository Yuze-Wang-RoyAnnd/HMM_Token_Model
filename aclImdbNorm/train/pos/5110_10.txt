i was about 11 years old i found out i live 0.48 miles from the uncle house. the uncle house is on westway dr, deer park, tx. they have added homes since the movie was made. i don't know the house number but you can go look it up. i am now 21 and i enjoy watching this movie. the bar on spencer is no longer their. pasadena isd wants to build a school their. i drove by the house last week the house still looks great. my dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie. where john cross over the railroad cracks they have made 225 higher. when i hear about john loesing his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time.
