strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in denmark, so i had to wait for the video release. my expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed. as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting, an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming. along with unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90`s.<br /><br />people who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the patriot(corny) or braveheart(acceptable) will be sourly disappointed, all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it. 9 out of 10.
