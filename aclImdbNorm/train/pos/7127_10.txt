marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of world war 11 england. what makes this film so good is the touching of the human element.this film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as "mrs. miniver" and "hope and glory." as is the case with this film, we see the desperation of people in the time of war.<br /><br />the performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw, who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the london bombing.<br /><br />we soon see why this child wets his bed. he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly.<br /><br />the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life. when the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy. he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's home.<br /><br />the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships.
