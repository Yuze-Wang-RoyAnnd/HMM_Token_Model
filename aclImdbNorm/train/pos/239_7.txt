i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didn't have the best time mainly because i didn't know about ned kelly or his story.<br /><br />but since this is a biopic, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character.<br /><br />i don't know if the manner the events are told are true, or if it everything is fictional. but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true. i don't think he's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief, but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />this is a solid western-type movie for everybody's tastes. heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screen.<br /><br />give this movie a chance if it airs on cable. otherwise, i don't think i could recommend it.
