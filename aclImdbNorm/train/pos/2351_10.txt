first i want to clarify that the average user's inability to appreciate imagination is appalling. what makes this show so unique is the hyper-reality it creates. you don't need to know why ned can bring people back from the dead, or why it can only be for a minute. where has the wonderment of childhood whimsical tales gone, much like a wrinkle in time.<br /><br />i say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of lay-it-all-out television that leaves no room for imagination or wonder.<br /><br />it's nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experience.<br /><br />the hyper-reality is my favorite aspect of the show. the 1950's-esque setting, the innocent and rare characters, and the scenery and physical setting which are not meant to be taken as pure reality.<br /><br />this show masks the morbid nature of death, while others embrace it. while entertaining, other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series. it truly has restored a sense of curiosity, imagination and wonder to television.<br /><br />pushing daisies quickly made it to the top of my list.
