i've read up a little bit on che before watching this film and you wanna know something, he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other latin americans in general! now, i don't know about others, but to me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share. however, the powerful elite obviously weren't going to go for that. so, rather than understanding what che guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in attempting to suppress the revolution. it didn't work since there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off. a good example of this was when castro continued his leadership in cuba. as far as i'm concerned and as che said it himself right before he died: "if you kill me, that's fine. but you're only killing a man, you'll never kill the cause!" i couldn't have said it any better myself.<br /><br />but ... anyways.... that's why i give this film a 7 out of 10.
