i became a fan of the tv series `homicide: life on the street' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. it was a cop show unlike any other: visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. <br /><br />homicide: the movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-television film can be. after lt. giardello (yaphet kotto), now a candidate for mayor of baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. in addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. the intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series. all in all, a terrific tv movie.<br /><br />vote: 9
