purple rain... what else can i say, the title speaks for itself. but i think all the actors were well picked. the movie had a great story. i loved it! ever since i watched that movie, i've been stuck in the eighties, and i'm only 13! my favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions, and the apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand. critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance. murphy brown also did a great job in the movie, he actually acted like himself. i'm so glad i've seen this movie. the song purple rain, beautifully sung, was so heartfelt. i cried more than once.
