well, it definitely is unlike anything else directed by lynch. no supernatural stuff, no violence, no profanity. nevertheless, it is a beautiful flick. it's a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6-week(that's my best guess for its duration) journey. the characters are everyday people and thus, they are believable. the performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. everyone who has a sibling can relate to it. lyle and alvin don't even have to say anything. for a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten.
