this is one of the best films ever made. it is a realistic depiction of rural ranching life which was a big part of american history. the setting is 1906 wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century. the film keeps your interest without the added hollywood myths. the whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in america when it was mostly a rural nation. with this film, you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago. in a beautiful, scenic environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive, as well as the constant worries and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure. see this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history. this film is worth your time to see. my only question is - why aren't there more films like this one?
