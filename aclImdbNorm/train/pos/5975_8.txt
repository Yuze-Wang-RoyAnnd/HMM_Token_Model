every movie critic and metal head hated this movie but i enjoyed it. i saw this as a child on tv somewhere and was amazed by the scene where sammi comes on stage and plays trick or treat by fastway.<br /><br />the movie itself was typical 80's, guy gets pushed around by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be destroyed.<br /><br />matt from melrose place picks on skippy from family ties so skippy gets a record of tony fields from gene simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose, the highlight being where tony sings (lip-synchs) and dances to a metal song before the shyt hits the fan.<br /><br />there were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
