a bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director, robert siodmak and ella raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious "phantom" woman, and franchot tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor. as well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by elisha cook jr as a drugged out trap drummer, as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy. if you're used to seeing raines in more wholesome parts, she's allowed to go overboard here, especially in her scenes with cook. franchot tone also plays someone very different, and though it isn't a convincing part, he acts phenomenally. while the conspiracy is too contrived, the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting.
