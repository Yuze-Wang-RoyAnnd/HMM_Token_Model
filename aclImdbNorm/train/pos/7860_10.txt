i had never seen a silent movie until july 24, 2005. i had never seen a movie with mary pickford in it. i've seen thousands of movies. very few are hypnotic to me. i found last of the mohicans and unforgettable (ray liotta) to be hypnotic, so consider the source as you read this. i started watching tess of the storm country on tcm just to see who this mary pickford was, who has been credited by many for launching hollywood. i had no idea what i was in for. two hours later, i snapped out of it, and realized i'd watched one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen, playing a role perfectly suited to her. imagine a movie fan in 1922, having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before. you would have to see her again and again. the setting was perfect for a girl that expressive. she was a poor squatter, couldn't speak the king's english, but you had to admire her. what a movie... time to start my mary pickford movie collection!
