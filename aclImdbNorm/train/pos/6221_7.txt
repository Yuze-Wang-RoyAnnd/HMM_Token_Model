had this film been put together a tad better, it would be up there with the best of astaire and rogers. as it is, it's a fine movie but overly long with a tedious subplot, i.e., randolph scott romancing rogers' sister, played by harriet hilliard (that's ozzie nelson's wife to you baby boomers).<br /><br />astaire and scott are two navy men. scott meets hilliard the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian, and later on after ginger rogers has asked her friend (a blond but unmistakable lucille ball) to glamor her up. meanwhile, astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off. the result is some wonderful dance numbers, with astaire and rogers as a team as well as separately: "i'm putting all my eggs in one basket," "let yourself go," and "i'd rather lead the band." hilliard is sweet but a little lethargic as a plain jane turned glamor girl, although she sings her two songs well, "but where are you?" and "get thee behind me, satan" - one poster didn't care for that song, but i love the title. rogers is vivacious, and a youthful astaire is a dynamo.<br /><br />the highlight of the movie comes at the end with "let's face the music and dance," one of the most achingly beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by rogers and astaire. in it, they epitomize '30s glamor and fantasy. it is truly to be treasured and watched again and again.
