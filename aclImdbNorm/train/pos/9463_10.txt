i loved "dan in real life". a wonderful journey-to-love story like you've got mail or while you were sleeping, but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes, and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up. <br /><br />dan burns (steven carrell) is a popular advice columnist who can't seem to get things in his own life straightened out. until one day, on a family gathering/trip, he meets and instantly connects with marie (the always beautiful juliette binoche)a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a hazy filter hearkening back to the starlets of classic cinema. chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin, but marie must be off for a previous engagement, and they must part ways. <br /><br />later we are treated to dan's tight-knit, fun-loving relatives who not only have big breakfasts together but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweetly dorky dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes. what i liked so much was that although the family's characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some, i thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that doesn't venture into parody or crude exaggeration. the burns family is simply a close, loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for dan. there are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren't unrealistic. the family is nosey, but never mean-spirited or gossipy; quirky, but never outlandish.<br /><br />and then dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend he's brought to the family gathering. and thus begins a roller-coaster of restrained longing and funny love-budding. <br /><br />i could go on but i just thought this movie was simply awesome. it's not particularly "hip" or "clever", never too wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema. there is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny-but-real dialogue. in fact, early in the movie, the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic hollywood-style conversation where the characters say what they're thinking out loud.<br /><br />so i've probably rambled and repeated myself, but i highly recommend "dan in real life". it's a great date movie, trust me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a geek like me you'll get a bit teary-eyed. filled with fun and magical love, "dan in real life" won't disappoint.<br /><br />=================== 3.5 out of 4 stars grade: a
