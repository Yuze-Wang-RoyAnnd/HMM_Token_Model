eric clapton, jack bruce and ginger baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "cream." those were the psychedelic days of england and america and these guys looked it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. they played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff.<br /><br />well, these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful dvd concert disc shows us. i was always extremely familiar with clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but i didn't know what to expect from bruce and baker, neither of whom i hadn't seen in decades. they surprised me. when he was young, baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death. now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum playing was solid. bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. this is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing.<br /><br />some people criticized this show for being low-key. i don't agree with that. i have no complaints. the concert sounded very good. the second song, "spoonful," was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me.<br /><br />highly recommended.
