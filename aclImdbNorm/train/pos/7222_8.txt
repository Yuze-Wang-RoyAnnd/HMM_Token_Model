definitely one of the most witty and twisted who-dunnit i ever seen. christopher reeve and micheal caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole affair. <br /><br />very classy set pieces and the props really lend a sense of atmosphere to the proceedings. the minimalist feel works for the whole picture.<br /><br />my only complain isn't with the film itself but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the movie on dvd. i own the fullscreen version (which proves i love the film enough to endure fullscreen presentation) but a awesome deluxe or 'special' edition would most surely get my cash.
