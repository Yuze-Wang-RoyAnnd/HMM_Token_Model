i happened upon this film by accident, and really enjoyed. timothy busfield's character is without redeeming qualities, and at one point, busfield and star meloni ogle women as they pass by...meloni's take on the parade is different from busfield's. janel maloney is terrific...she looks very much like tea leone, but the major difference here is that janel can actually act. some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when it's on cable.
