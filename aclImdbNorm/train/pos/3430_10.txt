i caught this at a screening at the sundance film festival and was in awe over the absolute power this film has. it is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the military with hopes that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be taken care of by our government for it. the film details the psychological changes that takes place in boot camp as the soldiers are turned into "killers for their country" and put into the war and the after effects once they return home. it also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche. it pays homage to the soldiers and never ever criticizes the soldiers unlike other films, instead criticizes a system that is not prepared to and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned vets.<br /><br />this film is powerful, moving, emotional and thought provoking. it stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but by actually listening to them, and helping to support a change in the way their health and well being is taken care of after the killing ends.<br /><br />the best film of the festival so far, ****/****
