a man readjusts to life alone after 45 years of marriage. he also has to solve the problem of the family milch cow, tulip, which refuses to allow itself to be milked. until, that is, he visualizes his wife who was the one who used to milk tulip.<br /><br />tulip is based on a real story told in griffith's family, of her grandparents' generation. the film is a nostalgic look back at a disappearing way of life, one where people still felt some sense of responsibility for each other, set in the lush green victorian (the australian state, not the era) countryside.<br /><br />writer and director griffiths evidently has further ambitions in both areas, and this multiple award-winning 15-minute short is a fine beginning to her reel.
