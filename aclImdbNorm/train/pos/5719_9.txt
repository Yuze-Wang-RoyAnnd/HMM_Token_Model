as i've noticed with a lot of imdb comments, certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness. i am not one of those people. if i watch an action film, i want to see explosions, gunfire and heroics. if i watch a comedy, i want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. you get the idea. therefore watching a horror film, i primarily want to be scared. the grudge is a very scary film, in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes, and it's creepy imagery. i've been a horror film fan for many years, and i'm talking about the masters such as dario argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days. if you want to be scared, watch this film. way scarier than the original japanese 'ring' (which i also think is a great film).
