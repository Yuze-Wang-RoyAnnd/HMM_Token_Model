certain dvd's possess me until i just have to go out and buy it. this was one of those movies. like many on here, i remember seeing it as a child and loved it. i never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut, so i was intrigued to see what they might be. i will agree that the "portabellow road" sequence is now a tad long (as is the soccer game) but other than that, i found no qualms with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place. perhaps disney should have had the original version (which is the restored version) on one side with the restored version on the flip side, then people could choose what they wanted to view. all in all, it's still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories.
