i rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it, part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night. after several awful american action adventure films (ballistic, daredevil, cradle of life) zhu warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking. the story is complete nonsense, but i found the film's sincerity, good- heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing, and the film looks spectacular. sure, the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by hollywood, but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color, composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking. in one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock, a huge moon rising before them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. in another, a princess-warrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking missile. and the colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotion rather than to represent reality.<br /><br />the characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters, offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply. physically, several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful. they play their roles straight up, without irony or guile, and so are believable.<br /><br />most strange of all, despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations, i found myself very near tears at the end, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original, good-hearted vision of the director.<br /><br />
