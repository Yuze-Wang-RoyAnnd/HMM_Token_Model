partially from the perceived need, one feels, to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a 1950's movie-going public. <br /><br />the film starts with some wickedly funny characterizations of the upper-class bureaucrats running the foreign office --- the british are pilloried in the way that only the british can pillory themselves. but after that, the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot. terry-thomas watchable as always, but the great talent in the cast (peter sellers, et al) is largely wasted.<br /><br />a diverting, but not great film.
