this is a really great short from hal roach. this is because of two main reasons: the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and well-written elements.<br /><br />as for the littlest of the little rascals, i honestly can't think of a cuter kid than spanky at about age four. despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in later years, he was just precious here. and, placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only funny, but once again high on the cute factor.<br /><br />after the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job, all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose. the gags are pretty effective and well-done for the time--with an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where spanky finally gets control of the little ones being the most memorable. i haven't seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad i gave this one a chance.
