1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members.<br /><br />11 nominations and not a single title: such was the academy's disdain for one of their greatest directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler's list, which is, arguably, not as good (and i'm half-polish).<br /><br />don't get me wrong, schindler was a classic. and i'm not knocking 'out of africa' (which won that year) either; but it was, in my mind, a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and i'm not a big cryer.<br /><br />maybe it was the music (superb), or the cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely simply the acting: whoopi, who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne; danny glover, who i'd never heard of before; and, of course, oprah.<br /><br />the rest is history; but, at the time: who knew?
