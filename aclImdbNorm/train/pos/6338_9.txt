i really liked this movie i saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details. i think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it. i specially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and gave a cause of why he was the way he was, the villain in this movie was not the actual grinch but the major, much different than the original cartoon. jim carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for both kids and adults alike.
