this is one of my all-time favorites. great music and some funny bits. i laugh every time at millie, the maid pretending to be a d'ebutante, holding her dainty hankie while chatting, and mindlessly polishing furniture with it as she chats. i just never can get past her french accent never being a problem as they try to pass her off as the boss's daughter.<br /><br />seeing a teenage mel torme and the very young frank sinatra singing is such a treat. my mom saw frank sinatra at a theater about the same time this movie came out. she said they couldn't clear the "bobby-soxers" out between movies (in those days you didn't have to leave between showings). this movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young frank was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well. and victor borge gets in a bit of his routine in, which is a bonus. <br /><br />this is a fun movie with a sweet, simple storyline. very enjoyable.
