i saw this movie at a college film festival back in the 70's - i have been waiting forever for this movie to come out on video (finally it's out). it was made in brazil, so i assumed that was why it hadn't made it to video yet. i have been checking video stores for the past 15 years waiting for this outstanding movie to come out! it is one of my all-time favorites - but be warned, it is weird, like werner herzog weird - its weirdness stems from its super-realism.<br /><br />the movie is based on a true incident back a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when europeans were first encountering the tribes in the amazon. a white man is mistaken by a savage tribe of cannibals as their enemy, so they intend to kill him. before they dispatch him, though, they make him part of their tribe (their custom). the entire movie is like watching a national geographic documentary as he becomes an accepted member of their tribe. that's it. cosmic plotline? no. intense insight into the variety of human life? definitely.<br /><br />oh yeah... be warned... this film has definite nudity - this is not some hollywood schlock flick about noble savages... this film tells it like it was (re-read above: national geographic, super-realism)<br /><br />
