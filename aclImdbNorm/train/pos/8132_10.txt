i don't remember when i first heard about this movie, but i rented it about six years ago, and it still remains one of my favorite comedies. i will admit, you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music. but if you are a rap fan, even a casual one, you will love the inside jokes and references. one of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b**** and a h**; i still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it. one of the best performances comes from larry scott, who played nerd lamar in `revenge of the nerds'. it is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a dvd release.
