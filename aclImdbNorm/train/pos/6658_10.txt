mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie. don't get me wrong i am not condemning the movie; it is such a wonderful movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat. we need to understand mahatma's spiritual standing, he is a true spiritual leader. only a fully enlightened man could possibly detach himself from his loved ones. a man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example. according to the movie, he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from, but poor harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father. when things went wrong with harilall, mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a big tragedy. <br /><br />had it been any other parents, they would have compromised their values to assist the son to get on his feet. mahatma didn't do that, he is true leader who leads by example.
