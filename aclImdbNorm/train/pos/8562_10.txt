i liked it! the plot was weird, drew barrymore and dc making out was awkward for both of them. drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time. dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool, and as always he does his best - i'm a major dennis fan anyway, that's why i bought the dvd.<br /><br />i didn't get the ending! that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool, which is ok i guess but it could have been more. <br /><br />....and the whole thing with the knife- if it was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it? <br /><br />it was very confusing as to when it was the doppelganger weird thing or when it was dc-or was it dennis all the time? because the doppelganger made out with dennis and patrick. in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the doppelganger then i think patrick would notice.<br /><br />the music was ok but obtrusive in places, the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone.<br /><br />a big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of drew nude. <br /><br />all in all a bit of a gpm-guilty pleasure movie. don't read too much into it, don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it. there are some diamond moments and goofs galore- watch it and just have a bit of fun with it!
