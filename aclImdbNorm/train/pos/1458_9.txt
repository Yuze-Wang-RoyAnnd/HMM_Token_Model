sharp, well-made documentary focusing on mardi gras beads. i have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate ideas about a larger, more complex, and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home.<br /><br />i am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and globalism's effect on poorer nations (however people feel about it). rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox (not that there's anything wrong with that, other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted), this documentary simply shows mardi gras beads, how they are manufactured, by what people, and under what conditions, and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process. it openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, american importers, and finally, the consumer at the end of the chain.<br /><br />i felt a little sickened by this; equally by the mardi gras revelers, but also by the way the workers in china have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). the footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end, made a particular impression. but that was just my reaction; i can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently.<br /><br />unlike other documentaries on this subject, i don't think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this. this is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume. if you have ever bought a product made in the far east, this should give you something to think about.<br /><br />outstanding and highly recommended. need to see more documentaries like this. kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film.
