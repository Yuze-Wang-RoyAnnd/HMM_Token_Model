this show is totally worth watching. it has the best cast of talent i have seen in a very long time. the premise of the show is unique and fresh ( i guess the executives at abc are not used too that, as it was not another reality show). however this show was believable with likable characters and marvelous story lines. i am probably not in the age group they expect to like the show, as i am in my forty's, but a lot of my friends also loved it (late 30's - mid 40's) and are dying for quality shows with talented cast members. i do not think this show was given enough time to gain an audience. i believe that given more time this show would have done very well. once again abc is not giving a show with real potential a real chance. with so many shows given chance after chance and not nearly worth it! they need to give quality shows a real chance and the time to really click and gain an audience. i really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode. i have been watching the episodes on abc videos and the show keeps getting better and better. although i think they owe us one more episode (number 13?). we want to watch what we can! bombard abc with emails and letters and see if its possible to save this show from extinction. it certainly worked for jerico. some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them. sign the online petition to abc at: http://www.petitiononline.com/gh1215/petition.html
