with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars, but produces and directs as well, you know it's got to be good. although some say that the enforcer is the best out of the series, i completely disagree. in my opinion, apart from the original dirty harry, sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series. although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences, it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do. this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good, and it's got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good. in diry harry it's "..well do ya, punk?"; in magnum force "a man's got to know his limitations" ; and in this it's "go ahead. make my day." also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery, as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san fransisco streets in the other films in the series. with great acting by clint eastwood and co-star sandra locke, and good directing by clint, this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever.
