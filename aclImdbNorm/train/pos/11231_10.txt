i really like star trek hidden frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more i have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it. i have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view. i have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out. i rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 loll my compliments to the staff of the star trek hidden frontiers on an excellent job. if u like star trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film. the detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it
