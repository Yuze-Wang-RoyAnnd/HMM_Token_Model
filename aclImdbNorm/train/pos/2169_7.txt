ok, first of all, ignore the last person' review. they admit to falling asleep through it so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was going on!!! as thriller/horrors go, this film ain't too bad, it is certainly very watchable. right from the opening scenes you get a general idea exactly what is going to be the cause of all the craziness that follows, and come the end you are proved right with everything being made clear.<br /><br />i enjoyed this movie, it was quite eerie at times and as old films go it was passable. great to watch late at night! i give it a generous 7 out of 10.
