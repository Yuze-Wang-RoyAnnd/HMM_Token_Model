"welcome to collingwood" offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory. watching this comedy directed by the brothers anthony and joe russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past, but since we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of, was the 1958 italian film "big deal on madonna street", directed by mario monicelli.<br /><br />the russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. anything with william h. macy, luis guzman, sam rockwell, patricia clarkson, the late michael jeter, in it, can't be bad. since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine.<br /><br />the film presents us a group of inane would-be safe crackers from hell. no one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake. whatever could go wrong, and more, is what they succeed in doing. george clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi, only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of cossimo's funeral.<br /><br />the best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these small time crooks do their thing. let their funny lines make you laugh, as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end!
