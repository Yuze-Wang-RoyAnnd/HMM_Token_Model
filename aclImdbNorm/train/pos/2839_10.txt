i saw this movie at an advance screening and found it excellent.<br /><br />new york i love you is a true spin on a romance that explores clever, funny, and sometimes shocking situations around the human race's most powerful emotion.<br /><br />the cast is huge, a veritable oceans 11 with andy garcia, ethan hawke, shia labouf, natalie portman, bradley cooper and others. they all give stand out performances in one way or another.<br /><br />that's not to mention that there is a who's who of directors interweaving stories in clever and interesting ways. brett rattner, shaka kapur, natalie portman, i mean -wow! this movie is not a straight ahead romance or romantic comedy even though it is both romantic and funny. it also has serious stories and notes. but that's good in my opinion. go see it for yourself and reply to my review, i want to hear what others have to say.
