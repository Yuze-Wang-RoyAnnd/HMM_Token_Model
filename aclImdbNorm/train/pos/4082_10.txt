hayao miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to walt disney. that is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist. he really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br /><br />but where can i begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me. laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and i wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination. ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like? the answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true. every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself. not to mention the excellent score by joe hisaishi! everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.
