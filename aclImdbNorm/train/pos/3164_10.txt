i can't believe we don't have that 70's show anymore. i have all 8 seasons of that 70's show!! i absolutely love it!! i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep. at the end of a long busy day it's nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep. i was so sad they took the show off air... at least we still have the re-runs!! i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion...like maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married!!!! wouldn't that be awesome!!! it would be even better if they would continue it for several years!!
