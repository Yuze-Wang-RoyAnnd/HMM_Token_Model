listen, i don't care what anybody says, as cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie. cypher is not, i repeat not, a b movie. cypher is an absolute masterpiece. suffice it to say, i am a connoisseur of the world's finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight. i cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is. cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made. the technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime. in fact, i must admit that cypher completely surprised the hell out of me. in fact, i've recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. other critics, of whom some downplayed the movie, have no idea as to what the hell they're talking about. don't listen to the haters. and actually, for the most part, reviews of cypher have been largely positive. and it should be noted that cyher is not only a good movie, but it is also a fantastic movie. cypher is the kind of movie that's so advanced and so magnificently crafted, that it's over the heads of most critics and all the cynics. there is nothing wrong with or cheap about cypher whatsoever. again, the cinematography, the backdrops, the technology, the storyline, and the acting are all 100% world-class top notch. naturally, i won't give anything away. this is not a spoiler. and though it is the contention of some critics that cypher should have been in movie theaters, i believe quite the opposite. cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for dvd release only and not in a bad way. cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves. blade runner, 1984, brave new world, total recall, logan's run, jason bourne and impostor and deja vu... look out! cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the aonn multimedia research, 5 star eternal spy movie hall of fame. cypher is counterespionage at it's absolute best. hands down and hats off. nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction. the future is now.
