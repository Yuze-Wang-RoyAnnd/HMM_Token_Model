i just watched this movie on showtime. quite by accident actually. if i wouldn't have only had 6 hrs of sleep for the past two days then i wouldn't have came home early from work. if i hadn't came home early from work i wouldn't have seen this movie. i wouldn't have known what i was missing, but i would've missed a lot.<br /><br />that's the way this movie is. it's almost playing on the kevin bacon effect. that and causality (hence my verbiage above). ever character is intertwined in some way or another. action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. this movie is just wonderful. i'm going to have to find a copy to buy.
