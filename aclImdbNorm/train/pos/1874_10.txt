every one should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and it may help us realize 1) my life isn't as bad as i thought it was and 2) how important it is to adopt a child in need. there are so many out there. to think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be. corrupt, but that corruption doesn't have to reach your home. we all have a choice! definitely recommend this one... and while you're at it, i'd like to throw in "the color purple" and "woman, thou art loosed" by t.d. jakes.<br /><br />these are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life.
