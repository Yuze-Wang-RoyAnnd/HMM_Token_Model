i was surprised at how fascinating this movie was. the performances were extremely good, especially by rea as the compassionate no-nonsense detective.<br /><br />despite a low budget, no big fx or flashy camerawork, citizen x somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big hollywood films by just. telling. the. story.<br /><br />true stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang, and that's the case here, but apart from that, this is a highly recommended detective yarn.
