i was 10 years old when this show was on tv. by far it was my favorite. the actors were very credible. alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous.... i just order the dvd (15 episodes). they didn't have super-powers. they just had superior human skills (strength, hearing, sight). the 3 actors were very good in their rolls, very believable. there was a good story in each episode. at the time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was suppose to be good, and the characters performs were great. there was no fancy stuff, like in other shows. they didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff.
