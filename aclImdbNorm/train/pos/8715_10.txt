this movie is by far the cutest i have seen in a long time! wonderful animation and adorable characters (even the bad guys were cute!) made this one a total winner in my book, and also in the books of those i saw it with. i still want to see it again, but haven't had time. better than toy story, which was good too, but not this good .
