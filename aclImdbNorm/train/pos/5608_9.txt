sure, he became rapidly uneven after this film, but from "knife in the water" up till "the tenant", roman polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique. despite many running themes (alienation, paranoia), no two of his films are really alike. the story of this is somewhat similar to his own "repulsion" from ten years earlier, but the tone is completely different. "the tenant" manages to balance darker than dark absurdity (i'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor, even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny) with some truly suspenseful paranoia. polanski was always a master at building unease, and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy. the overall weirdness of the film is also a plus.<br /><br />in addition to polanski's exquisite as usual direction, the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions. polanski the actor is often overshadowed by polanski the director, but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast. the themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange. the rest of the cast offers strong performances also, especially isabelle adjani's sympathetic turn, and melyvn douglas and shelley winters' appropriately annoying ones. "the tenant" is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both "repulsion" and "rosemary's baby", but its just as brilliant as either of those classics. (9/10)
