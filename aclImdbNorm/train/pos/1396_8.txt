probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful, dramatic episode (in this case, the superb balance of terror) with a lighter affair, shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci-fi, and while the formula isn't quite right yet in this entry (the true triumph is trouble with tribbles, in season 2), the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness.<br /><br />diverting from the show's tradition, the enterprise isn't on any proper mission in this episode. instead, kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty: a well deserved break after three months of incessant work. the earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens: dr. mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis carroll's work. soon, other people begin experiencing similar things: a woman meets a don juan-like character, sulu has a run-in with a samurai, and kirk faces a double encounter with the past, in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy. throw in a freakishly real-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out what's going on before anybody gets hurt.<br /><br />the idea is a classic one: idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly. the episode's humorous take on the topic is rather successful, weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest (of course, everything works out fine again come the end) and the cast's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves (most notably, and ironically, the otherwise hilarious william shatner). and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new, previously unseen things: the definition of star trek's success.<br /><br />7,5/10
