this is one of the funniest movies i have seen. i watched it on dvd, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what i care about. <br /><br />i tend to judge movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. this is a smaller film and i am willing to forgive minor things. that said, i believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that i have seen.<br /><br />i enjoyed the acting of all of the major players. i especially enjoyed til schweiger and alan arkin. alan arkin has most of the funniest lines. the character portrayed by claire forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people, but i have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does. that helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor.<br /><br />this is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. there is quite a bit of adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very funny. (in particular, alan arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly.)<br /><br />also watch for the cameos from known character actors.
