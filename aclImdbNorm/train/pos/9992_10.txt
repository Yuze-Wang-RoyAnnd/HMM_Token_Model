...this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss. nice story, funny riches-to-rags situations, mel brooks is not a bad lead, maybe not perfect but he is funny ;d don't pay attention to the rating, it's bs. watch it, then watch something like final destination (2009) and tell me that life stinks deserves about the same rating. if you do, i don't think we can be friends xd at this point i recommend the fourth season of "curb your enthusiasm" to every brooks fan ;) vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms! i've to make 10 lines here to post a comment? i don't wanna write a book here :p
