while the story of a troubled kid turning to boxing for self-respect and anger management is hardly a new thing, the story is given a fresh twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy.<br /><br />diana has trouble at school. she just can't stay away from fighting. at home her father is constantly putting her down. her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to train.<br /><br />it would be easy to call this movie a "rocky with girls" i guess. but that is not at all what this is about. the story actually benefits very much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy. that way you can deal with more problems at once. first the problem of her not being accepted because she's not a girlie-girl, and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she's a girl at all. it's also a story about how a purpose can change someones life. how positive things can make you grow. i don't want this to sound pretentious, because the movie doesn't feel pretentious at all, but what i'm saying is true.<br /><br />also michelle rodriguez is very good in the lead. it's a shame really that she has become stuck in the "tough girl" typecasting now, because that's really not what her part in "girlfight" is all about. sure she's a female boxer, but rather it's the more sensitive moments that really makes her shine.<br /><br />so maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist, but it's lifted way above the crowd by rodriguez' performance. i rate this 7/10.
