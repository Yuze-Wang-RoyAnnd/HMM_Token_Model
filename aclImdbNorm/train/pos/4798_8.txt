this is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie lynch stuff. rather, it's for those who either appreciate a good story, or have grown tired of the run-of-the-mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and oprah-ish "this is such a wonderful movie! you must see it!"-semantics (tho' she is right, for once!).<br /><br />the story unfolds flawlessly, and we are taken along a journey that, i believe, most of us will come to recognize at some time. a compassionate, existentialist journey where we make amends f"or our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise.<br /><br />acting is without faults, cinematography likewise (occasionally quite brilliant!), and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story.<br /><br />a warm movie. not excessively sentimental.
