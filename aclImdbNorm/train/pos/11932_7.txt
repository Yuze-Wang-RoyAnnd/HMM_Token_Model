i saw this film on tv many years ago and i saw this film when i got this on tape. i thought that this was reasonably well done. it was not the best of all movies, but it was good enough. the movie has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger kids. the acting was good, with danny glover leading the cast. the plot line was not very believable, but the script was well written. this movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans. it does not directly apply to a action-packed sports movie. it directly applies to a nice film that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this film. overall, the film was good, but not great. i give this a movie a 7/10.
