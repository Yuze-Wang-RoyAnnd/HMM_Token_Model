moonwalker is a fantasy music film staring michael jackson with different segments. i will rate each segment individually.<br /><br />segment 1 opens the film with a music video. the music video is a concert of michael jackson performing the song "man in the mirror", the music video also show's montages of historical figures such as gandhi, martin luther king jr, john lennon and more. the first segment was a good choice to open the film i liked the song and also loved the montage of the historical figures. i even loved the message in the song. i give the first segment a 9/10.<br /><br />segment 2 shows a montage of michael jackson's start from the jackson five to his solo career. the montage i thought was well made, i liked the animation they put into it and i also loved their choices of songs such as "i i want you back, beat it, thriller, can you feel it and the way you make me feel." the only thing i wish they could have done a little a better in one of the songs in the montage is "we are the world". the reason why is all you see is rain drops and in those drops are images of michael jackson and the chorus of the celebrities, but it's a little hard to see the chorus. other than that the segment is still good. i give it a 9/10<br /><br />segment 3 is the song bad. you're probably thinking it's michael jackson's music video of bad,well yes and no. this segment is the music video but it's redone by kids. the segment was cute but it wasn't as good as the other segments. i give it a 6/10<br /><br />segment 4 is a short claymation music film that takes place after the kid's version of bad called "speed demon". the short is about michael jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to get away from them. the claymation in the chase sequence was great but some parts in the film the claymation characters looked a little fake when they interact with real people. also at the end of the clip out of nowhere michael jackson rabbit costume comes to life and he's dancing with it. i liked the dancing but that was like out of nowhere. i give it a 8/10<br /><br />segment 5 is michael jackson's grammy winning music video "leave me alone." the music video is about the media poking their nose at michael jackson's personal life and michael jackson feels they won't leave him alone no matter how much he's proved innocent. the music video really speaks out( but keep in mind this happened before the child molestation this just all about the rumors of him in the 80's.) but i didn't feel this video should be in this movie because it's a kids movie and i don't think kid's will understand what he's singing about. i give this music video 8/10<br /><br />segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called "smooth criminal." michael jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wishing star as a crime figure to protect children ( including john lennon's son sean lennon) from an evil mobster named mr bigg (played by joe pesci). the segment i thought really brought out the film especially when he danced and sang the song "smooth criminal" with a bunch of criminals. i also thought the special effects were good. the weird thing about the segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why. also joe pesci character talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them. i mean why would you talk about drugs in a kids film. other wise it was good. my rating for this segment is a 8/10<br /><br />segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie. the film end's with michael jackson singing a cover version of the beatle's song "come together" and then during the credit's we see michael jackson singing with ladysmith black mambazo. michael did a good cover of "come together" and i think it was good idea putting including a group of good singer's with a talented musican like him. my rating is 9/10<br /><br />this movie is a good michael jackson film i think it really brings out children s imagination. the film is almost as imaginative as the beatles animated movie "yellow submarine" if you like michael jackson and you're up to a film with a lot of creativity this is the film. my overall rating for this movie is 8/10
