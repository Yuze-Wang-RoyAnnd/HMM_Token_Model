this is the best dub i've ever heard by disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in kiki delivery service. urrrghhh<br /><br />this one has different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. this one has both hero and heroine (although i don't really endorse the use of hero & heroine here, since miyazaki is out from the stereotype & common theme). as usual, after being introduced by spirited away, amazed by mononoke, troubled by grave of fireflies, and deeply touched by majo no takkyuubin , this one start with a bit doubt in my part. wondering if this will be the first ghibi's dud. well, in the end just like only yesterday and whisper of the heart, i ended up giving 10 rating. i'd give 9.8 rating, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie.<br /><br />spoiler somehow i see this as a sad movie, people die in this one, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction. it is as if mankind really can't live with too much power. the collapsing scene gave me patches of metropolis ending. it's just sad somehow. the plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well (as always). joe hisaishi really belongs to uematsu, kanno, williams caliber.people who can brings a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition.<br /><br />this is a feel good movie that used to be part of us cinema in the classic days (it's a wonderful life etc etc). well, things change....
