i am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie. i saw it at an independent film festival, so don't expect it to come to your town anytime soon. during the film, i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out. too bad for them (down here in the south, folks don't like having to read subtitles). the movie starts out slow, but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored. when the action finally arrives, i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller coaster.<br /><br />i also got a big kick of the chapter titles appearing before the chapters, especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen. it reminded me of zelda (ocarina of time) when you face level bosses.<br /><br />if this is the future of "video game/comic book" movies, then i welcome it.
