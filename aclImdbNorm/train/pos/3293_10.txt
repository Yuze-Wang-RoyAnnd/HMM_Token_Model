if ever i was asked to remember a song from a film of yester years, then it would have to be "chalo di daar chalo chand ke paar chalo" for its meaning, the way it is sung by lata mangeshkar and mohd. rafi, the lyrics by kaif bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars. the other would have to be "chalte chalte." pakeezah was meena kumari's last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen. in each of the the songs that are picturised, she looks young but after that she does not. but one actor who didn't change in his looks was the late raj kumar, who falls in love with her and especially her feet, after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them, he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are.<br /><br />conclusion: pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs. the movie stars the meena kumari, raj kumar and ashok kumar and is directed by kamal amrohi.<br /><br />kamal amrohi's grandson has now started to revive his grand father's studio by making a comedy movie.
