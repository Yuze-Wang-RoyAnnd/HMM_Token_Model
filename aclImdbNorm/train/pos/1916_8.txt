"8 simple rules... for dating my teenage daughter," is my opinion, is an absolute abc classic! i'm not sure i haven't seen every episode, but i still enjoyed it. it's hard to say which episode was my favorite. however, i think it was always funny when a mishap occurred. i always laughed at that. despite the fact that james garner and david spade were good, i liked the show more when john ritter was the leading man. if you ask me, his sudden passing was very tragic. everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, i hope some network brings it back on the air for fans of the show to see.
