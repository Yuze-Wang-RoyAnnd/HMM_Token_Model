wilson (erica gavin) is nabbed by the cops and sent to prison in this slick and amusing example of prime 70's exploitation, marking the directing debut of jonathan demme. after writing and producing a few of mentor roger cormans' new world films, demme was afforded the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but has an appealing tongue-in-cheek quality to it as well; it's often as funny as it is flashy.<br /><br />standout scenes include a lewd and crude vaudeville style act performed for the prisoners, as well as a potent dream / fantasy sequence for uptight and obviously very repressed superintendent mcqueen (horror icon barbara steele, doing a marvelous turn in this antagonistic role). i also enjoyed a bank robbery scene gone haywire and a carjacking scene that was simply uproarious. as in other movies of this kind, it's also commendable that it's as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation. these women are tough, they take no garbage from anybody, and they're more than capable of handling themselves.<br /><br />our attractive cast here makes the most of their roles: juanita brown as the aggressive maggie, roberta collins as the sassy belle, rainbeaux smith as the cute and timid lavelle, gavin as the wide-eyed newcomer, and lynda gold (a.k.a. crystin sinclaire) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside.<br /><br />as our climax plays out, demme comes up with a tense "beat the clock" finish as our heroines race to save belle from being lobotomized by predatory dr. randolph (warren miller), the type of man who thinks nothing of taking advantage of women.<br /><br />bouncing along to john cales' flavorful score, "caged heat" is upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time.<br /><br />8/10
