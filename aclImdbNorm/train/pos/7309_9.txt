as i mentioned previously, john carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by (the other being the classic conan the barbarian). it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers, whom i eventually befriended (imaginary friend) to keep him from killing me in my sleep. now that is terror for a 10 year old.<br /><br />it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves. the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works, perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious. this all could happen. it isn't in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country (as most modern horror is, i.e. hostel, touristas, cry wolf, saw,etc). at times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations. i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head. it still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create. so we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety.<br /><br />carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday, middle class, suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on halloween and kills his sister. he then spends the next 15 years in an institution (which we thankfully do not experience) only to escape and return to his hometown, the infamous haddonfield. on his way he kills and kills. the child's name is michael meyers, though he is not a person. john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia. in the bastion of american safety and security, chaos can still strike.<br /><br />michael ceased to be a person once he killed. he is not a serial killer, human being or psychopath. he is as unstoppable force. the generic overalls, bleached-white shatner mask, and lack of any dialog other then some breathing, helps to dehumanize and complete michael's generification. this is the source of all his power. he is faceless, speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos. this is helped by the cinematography (post card effect), a lack of information/motivation/explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald pleasence (dr. loomis). his over the top performance and uneasiness sells "the shape". this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie strode, the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds (at least for a little bit). <br /><br />though this isn't the first movie of this new niche of horror films (black christmas came out 4 years earlier), it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing. if you haven't been scared by horror movies in a long time (like me), this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack. i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of john carpenter's career.
