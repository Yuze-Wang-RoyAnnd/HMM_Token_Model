has there ever been a movie more charming than this? one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives. the center of it is the "romance" of james stewart and margaret sullavan, who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals. but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies (including "you've got mail", the recent update of "shop") they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs. everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm. one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with. a must see! **** out of ****
