yes, a true classic! this is what british drama is all about,realism and the minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). i last saw this drama when it was last screened on british terrestial tv in 1994. it truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot,no big names but non-the-less great acting.sadly the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon.i myself recently acquired the woman in black on vhs,so now once again i shall be able to enjoy this truly great british drama. you should try and enjoy it too!<br /><br />mark r. horobin
