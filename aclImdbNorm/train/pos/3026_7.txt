charles boyer is supposed to be spanish, and he's come to london to buy coal in "confidential agent," a 1945 film also starring lauren bacall, katina paxinou, peter lorre, dan seymour, and wanda hendrix. boyer is luis denard, and everyone is out to stop him except bacall. his papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the fascists.<br /><br />this film has its good and not so good points. it rates high for atmosphere and for suspense, and it is highly entertaining. bacall is incredibly beautiful, boyer is passionate, paxinou is mean, lorre is slimy, hendrix appropriately pathetic, and seymour outrageously wonderful.<br /><br />the not so good points: bacall is supposed to be english, and boyer spanish. uh, no. boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent, but bacall is 100% american, not of the british upper class. the two have no chemistry. conclusion: bacall is somewhat miscast. her acting isn't up to snuff either; she's better in other films. but she's an astonishing looking woman, and much can be forgiven.<br /><br />paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful. dan seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. it's a great part and his performance is perfect, while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as good. this was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors. seymour wasn't a small actor.<br /><br />definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.
