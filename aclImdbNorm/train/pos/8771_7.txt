errol flynn had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when john l. sullivan (ward bond) went around claiming that he "could beat any man alive." both flynn and ward bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen.<br /><br />raoul walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style, capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor. all the warner contract players make up the fine cast--including the always reliable alan hale as flynn's rambunctious father, proud of his son's fighting abilities, and alexis smith who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking flynn down a peg with saucy one-liners dealing with his conceited manners.<br /><br />all of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious b&w, although it's too bad warners didn't have more faith in flynn to do the film in color. he was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time, engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out.<br /><br />the fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen, with flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. and the scene where bond turns over his award plaque to flynn at a social gathering is one of ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor.<br /><br />summing up: maintains interest all the way through, whether you're a sports fan or not.
