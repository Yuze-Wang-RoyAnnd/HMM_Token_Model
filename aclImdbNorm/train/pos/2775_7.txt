old movie buffs will know why i'd call this one "the man in the grey flannel robe." most bible-based movies are basically schlock- what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how peck, tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying neanderthals all about him. as a great romance, it falls flat as unleavened bread. but there is something gripping about this movie. of all the big hollywood bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the average american towards belief in the biblical god. billy sunday's thesis is duking it out with h.l. mencken's antithesis all through the script. who gets the better of it in the heavenly chorus-backed synthesis depends on your point of view. other than that, d & b boasts a good performances by peck ( especially in the closing repentance scene) and by jayne meadows as his bitter first wife michol, vivid, moody atmosphere (good idea to set most action at dawn or night), and the rousing rendition of the twenty-third psalm at the end.
