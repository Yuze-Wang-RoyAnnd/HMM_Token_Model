soon americans would swarm over a darkened, damaged england preparing to invade europe, but in 1937 the picture of hip americans in the sunny, slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing, idyllic diversion. american dancing star & heartthrob jerry halliday (astaire), on a european tour & weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager (burns), is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress lady alice marshmorton (fontaine). the tale is complicated by a betting pool among the marshmorton servants that is run by (and rigged for) head butler keggs (gardiner), who's betting on lady alice's cousin reggie (noble), the favorite of alice's stuffy, domineering aunt (collier). the story would have been much better as a half-hour tv episode. the usual wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full-length film. both alice & jerry appear impossibly (and annoyingly) clueless by the second half of the film. the amusement park interlude & the climax in the castle are too long & begin to drag. fontaine is too beautiful, too dignified & too quiet to be a ditzy blonde, no matter how aristocratic, while young footman albert (watson) is painfully awful. but while "damsel" is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent, the talent doesn't let us down. astaire's romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with ginger rogers and his dance scenes, both solo & with burns & allen, are up to par, though his one dance with novice hoofer joan is necessarily tame. gracie nearly steals the whole show as george's bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded, conniving & coolly self-confident. her scene with solid character actor gardiner as the devious snob keggs is a one-of-a-kind classic. this & astaire's priceless scene with the madrigal singers give "damsel" a delightful color of naive but noble-spirited americans mixing with noble but dull-spirited englishmen. gershwin is at the top of his game with "nice work if you can get it" & "stiff upper lip," which carry the film through its weak points. and is there another film where madrigals get a gershwin swing treatment? "damsel" is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see astaire without rogers or fontaine before she was a real star. it's a fine diversion as entertaining as any of the vaudevillian musical comedies that ruled the 1930s but will never be made again.
