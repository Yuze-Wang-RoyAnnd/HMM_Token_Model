with oliver hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. partner stan laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help ollie get all the rest he needs. it's a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (richard cramer) stows along for the ride.<br /><br />i got a kick out of all the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'silence while men are working'. the early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with stan doing a banana within a banana bit. laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture, like "we must have been dis-unconnected", but the one that had me rolling was his response to the criminal on board ship - "self preservation is the last law of averages" - precisely!<br /><br />i'm not as great a student of laurel and hardy's films as many on this board, all i know is i enjoyed them as a kid and find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth. on that count, "saps at sea" provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on it's way to hornomania.
