i was the production accountant on this movie, and i also got to do some voice-over work on it, so i'm not entirely unbiased, but if it were awful, i would say so. i thought it was a fun film, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, by any means, but there were plenty of laughs along the way. the bible states that laughter does good like a medicine, so watching this movie could be good for your health.<br /><br />so many of the actors in this picture hadn't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film. susan sarandon, of course, is one who has since gone on to much greater fame. melanie mayron was seen on tv on a weekly basis as a photographer in the "thirty-something" tv drama series. robert englund later became known as freddie krueger, still haunting people's dreams. one of my personal favorite actors on this show was dub taylor, who played the sheriff. he was an excellent comedic actor, and a truly nice, sincere person. we all had fun working on this show, and i think that fun comes through.
