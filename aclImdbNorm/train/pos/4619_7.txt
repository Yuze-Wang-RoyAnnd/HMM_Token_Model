first off, i'm a huge fan of 80s movies, and of jennifer conelly as well. so yesterday, i wandered into a local used book/movie store and found a vhs copy. i read the back and it sounded good and for $3.99, it was a good deal. so i took it home and popped it in the vcr. what a sweet movie! at my age now, i relate more to movies like about last night or st. elmo's fire, but still i remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older guy, etc. we all have those little crushes when we're younger. and if it doesn't work out, we're heartbroken and we think that we'll never get over it. but of course we do. many times. it's that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie. the feeling of "oooh! i remember when something like that happened to me..." is all through it. the characters are interesting and well-developed. i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies, teen films in particular, or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
