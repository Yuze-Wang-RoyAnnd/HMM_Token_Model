in a near future, the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb morgan sullivan (jeremy northam) is hired by digicorp, a huge corporation, to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors, sunways. along his training, morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity of jack thursby and travels to boring lectures. in one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious rita foster (lucy liu), who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be. morgan acknowledges a new reality, where he does not know who can be trusted.<br /><br />the unknown "cypher" was a great surprise for me. this movie has not been released in brazil, but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex, with many plot points, and with great screenplay, direction and performances. in the very last twist, i recalled arnold schwarzenegger's "total recall". this movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once, and i really did not like the last scene, when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea. in only know the director vicenzo natali from the fantastic "cube", and this second work i see is also stunning. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): not available
