this movie can be interpreted on many different levels. don't listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w/e and that it is just about drugs. it has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs; however, the rest of the movie (and why i think it was personally made) is really not about that at all. it is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society. it shows, for a split second, that the main character's brother is watching those sick videos online. why? my interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all of this gruesomeness that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people. as far as the scene about logic, it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1% smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn't as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level. you have to apply heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty) not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way. one of the best movies i have ever seen. it just might go way above your head; it isn't for you it is for those people who are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem. when you are critically analyzing a movie or writing your critical review's try not reading the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists)
