did you know, that anthony kiedis, (singer from the red hot chili peppers) father is in this movie. blackie dammit, is anthony's father. i noticed this after reading "scar tissue" anthony's autobiography, and saw a picture of his father. i thought, "well, that guy kinda looks like that guy from that movie i saw in the eighties. then i read more and it said his father was an actor that had a few small roles. after checking this site, and comparing with a search on the net, i realized it really is his father in the movie. it's funny, because nowhere in the book does it mention him being in this movie. perhaps his son was ashamed of his father's acting job in this flick, but he need not be. i think his father, blackie, did a great job in the show.
