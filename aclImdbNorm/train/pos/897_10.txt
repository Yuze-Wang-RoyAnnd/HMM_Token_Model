what can i say, i have grown up watching hum saath saath hain, hum aapke hain koun and maine pyar kiya. soraj have always been different. movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times soraj creates something thats hard to find. love and joint family that loving and great. vivah is journey for a couple that are getting arrange marriage that turns on arrange and love marriage. shahid has done fine work. anupamji as always brilliant. amrita rao quit different even though i felt that someway the other to me she doesn't suit in that role. we've seen her in ishk vishk and ab ke baras, and main ho on na. so quit different role that she isn't in to. she is been excellent in main ho on na and ishk vishk but may be she could've put little more in the role. anyways great going work by barjatya. this movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot. sweet film of the year. great music and lyrics. i am not sure if its a remake but anyways brilliant story that is original. soraj's movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him. great work by all the cast the crew and everybody. lovely family film to enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and love ones. i give it 10 out of 10.
