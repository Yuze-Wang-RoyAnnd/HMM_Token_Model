"panic in the streets" was a decent thriller, but i felt a bit disappointed by it. the central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never really explores or develops it. its well made and entertaining, but its not as interesting as it should have been. the screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down. none of the central characters are really compelling or believable.<br /><br />fortunately, the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting. the direction by elia kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace. there are some standout sequences, particularly the memorable chase climax. when his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, the man could mostly do no wrong.<br /><br />the acting is also very good. richard widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character. paul douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well. the standouts in the cast are the two villains. zero mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is effectively slimy as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters. jack palance is, unsurprisingly, a chilling villain. "panic in the streets" is disappointing but still worth watching. (7/10)
