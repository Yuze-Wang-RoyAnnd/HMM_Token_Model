i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clich'e, but i was completely wrong! charlie cox (i had never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good leading man; he was so earnest and romantic, me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him.<br /><br />claire danes, who i did like before (loved her in romeo and juliet), made me enjoy her even more. her acting was fantastic, i couldn't even tell that she was american. the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good, the casting was quite perfect.<br /><br />robert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally well-casted; deniro as that gay pirate...priceless, priceless. i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the ship...oh my god, wow. pfeiffer played a decent villain, i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray. but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie. <br /><br />overall, it was funny (but not slap-stick at all!), romantic, the special effects weren't totally frequent but when they were, they were great; the cameos from ricky gervais and peter o'toole were also well-placed. <br /><br />i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings. it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out!
