i really have to say, this was always a favorite of mine when i went to see my grandma. and it still is. it is very, very close to the book. the way it is filmed, and the players were just all excellent! i have to recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it. almost everyone i talk to hates tv movies, but this was really great! i gave it 10/10.
