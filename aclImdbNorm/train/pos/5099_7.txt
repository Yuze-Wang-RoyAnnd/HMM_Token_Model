the only reason i came across this movie was that it's on the little miss marker dvd and i do recommend watching it although you won't like it as well as the better known movie.<br /><br />we have gary cooper and carole lombard as a con man and his companion. the film starts out quite light, but becomes more dramatic as coop first plans on using his daughter to extort a sizable amount of cash from his brother-in-law but upon meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be subject to with his brother-in-law elects to keep her. however, he has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path and so the drama develops.<br /><br />cooper and lombard are good and shirley still manages to steal the scenes she's in. there's little music in this, and shirley only has one song. however this is entertaining and worth watching along with little miss marker.
