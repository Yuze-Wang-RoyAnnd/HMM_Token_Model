halloween is a film i have to get out and watch every time it's that day of the year.i even watch it sometimes when it's not the holiday!!!this film is so great.jamie lee curtis is an actress i can never stop loving.this movie might be old,but the story line still gets me right there every time,and the acting was absolutely fantastic!!!although i have not seen the remake,i feel already that it was totally unnecessary.i think rob zombie should have never remade such a classic.what kills me though,is to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the original.i am getting furious just thinking about it!!!!!!this movie was great,and it will always be remembered in history as a classic.
