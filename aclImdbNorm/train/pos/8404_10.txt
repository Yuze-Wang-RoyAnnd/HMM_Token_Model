simple-minded but good-natured drive-in movie about a simple-minded but good-natured high school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his "ballroom". <br /><br />bobby, our hero, spends his entire savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams. joint sharing and love making quickly commence with girls bobby has picked up at the local pizza parlor, but he finds out much responsibility, danger and heartache come with being the owner of such a mechanical marvel.<br /><br />the van is a guilty pleasure of mine. it captures the laid back mid 70's mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the "so bad it's good" category.
