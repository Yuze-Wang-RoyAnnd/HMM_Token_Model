i was intrigued by the title, so during a small bout of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity...), i stayed up and watched it. i then checked my tv listings and watched it again! there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film- in spite of politics, traditions, culture, etc., teenagers everywhere are virtually the same. the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to, let's say, somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period, and language differences aside, would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era. they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations, politics aside: music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music... as a matter of fact, much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970's southern california.<br /><br />this was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable. the characters, especially the young actors, were completely believable also. i won't say this was the yugoslav "american graffiti", but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50's-themed movies.
