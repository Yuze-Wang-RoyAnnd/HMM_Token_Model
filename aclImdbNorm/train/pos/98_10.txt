for me too, this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly. in 1989, i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording, giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself. it's part of my family's christmas tradition now, and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listen.<br /><br />it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show, and they did more than one special together. the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here, in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages.
