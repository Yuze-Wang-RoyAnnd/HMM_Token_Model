this is one of those film's/pilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps, but isn't necessary. what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this isn't something so far away in the future. this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically. the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced & quite talented actors. eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re-united w/his daughter however real or not she is & he'll do it no matter the cost. paula malcomson of "deadwood" fame is terrific as his wife as well. you are not sure completely of his motives whether it's love or money or both, but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing. i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani & her performance. esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again & just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections. i didn't think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story. it's great to see adama as a child already being affected & influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage. i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots. this is an almost perfect pilot & i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling. even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. if you haven't gotten into bsg, @ least try this & i'll bet you become a fan & will want to see how the bsg story came to be.
