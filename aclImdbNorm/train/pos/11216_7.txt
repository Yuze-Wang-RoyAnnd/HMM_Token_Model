the story is extremely unique.it's about these 2 pilots saving earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly.the whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time,friends,and mentors.<br /><br />the ending could have been fantastic.it started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy disney note and annoyed me very bad.<br /><br />the animation is decent for 89 but can't compare to nowadays.i have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity.i actually found it to be somewhat decent.the nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess.<br /><br />overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic.
