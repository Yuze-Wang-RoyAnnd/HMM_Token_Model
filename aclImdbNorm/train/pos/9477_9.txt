this is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships.<br /><br />eventually they do become spoken, but is there a chance to change anything about the situation.<br /><br />originally made in shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the dai family. there is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family. history usually has weight in chinese literature and serious film.<br /><br />a young married couple - liyan, an invalid, and his wife yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially ruined.<br /><br />a bright contrast is liyan's young sister who cannot really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way. her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved.<br /><br />into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor...<br /><br />i ended up feeling quite sad - but definitely a superior film.
