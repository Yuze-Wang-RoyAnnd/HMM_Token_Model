i have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of h.g. wells' classic novel, "war of the worlds". timothy hines has finally done it! i just couldn't believe how good it was! from the acting, to the costuming, the out-of-this world special effects, i just can't say enough!it was wonderful! dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performances by a top-notch cast! it's got to be seen to be believed. i sure didn't. and i've read all those negative comments by the others, and can't believe what they were saying. we must've been watching a different movie, huh? and those real bad comments by that vepsaian guy, guy whoever he is, well, he just doesn't know what he's talking about.<br /><br />keep up the good work, mr. hines.
