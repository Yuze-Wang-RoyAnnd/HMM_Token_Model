i was really impressed with this film. the writing was fantastic, and the characters were all rich, and simple. it's very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them. the creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters, and getting the viewer sucked right into their world. further, the music is terrific. they employed some independents to do the score, and some of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie. if you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival (like i did), i highly recommend that you go see it. also, on a personal note, paget brewster is beautiful in this movie. that's reason enough to go check it out.
