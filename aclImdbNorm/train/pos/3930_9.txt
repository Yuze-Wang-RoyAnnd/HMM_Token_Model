it's remarkable that for 'young mr. lincoln's' supporting players ford cast lesser known, other-than-star actors. this not only heightens his film's focus on the central character of lincoln, but it also affords the audience a refreshing insight into lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man embroiled, as each one of us inexorably is, in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to resolving them. it's not so much through fonda's lincoln's words and actions but in the faces, the reactions of the supporting players that ford tells the story of the formation of the young lincoln's worldview, sense of place in society and polity, and of how the people responded to mr. lincoln's words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and heeding.<br /><br />give this a try: instead of focusing on henry fonda, next time you view 'young mr. lincoln' shift your focus to the supporting characters - you will, i expect, be handsomely rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both lincoln and ford. i like to suspect that ford's storytelling through the supporting characters' reactions to fonda's lincoln may have appealed to david lean when he directed omar sharif in 'doctor zhivago', in which it's the supporting characters' reactions to zhivago that actually tell about zhivago.
