this is a great movie that everyone should see. it plays like a dean koontz book.<br /><br />bill paxton's performance was great in that it really seems like he believes in what he is saying and doing.<br /><br />i don't know why viewers have to read in some kind of advocacy for religious murder in to the film. it is fiction. the ending is surprising, but fictional. so what? i think that is what makes this movie so good. spoiler do not read further if you havent seen the movie. throughout the movie, the viewer is continually shocked at the sickness of paxton's character, the impact on the children, and the way the children handle this outrageous conduct. and then at the end, it turns out to be true. god has put him on a mission to rid the world of demons. paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest. sure, he is given info that he couldn't have known otherwise, but the movie goes further to show how god is "protecting" adam through the convenient video quality problem and the complete lack of memory of the second fbi agent. the film isn't advocating christian murder, it is merely taking the viewer on a very unexpected ride.
