well, i just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than "little britain" and i like it! "the league of gentlemen" is a sick british comedy that is about the most awful, insane and disgusting small town in all the uk. this place makes dibley and craggy island (from "the vicar of dibley" and "father ted") seem pretty normal!! the format of the show is a lot like little britain except that all of it centers around the townspeople of this one hellish town. both shows feature the same skits again and again every episode and some obviously inspired "little britain" (particularly the job seeking class skit). but the show differs because although it is crude like "little britain" (hence not a show for kids), the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows. in particular, animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show.<br /><br />now if you haven't guessed, this is not a show for kids, the easily offended or normal people and that's probably why i liked it. however, you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max. funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief--you have to see it to believe it.
