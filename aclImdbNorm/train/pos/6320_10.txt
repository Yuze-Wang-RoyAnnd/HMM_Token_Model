the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast. a ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it. but this movie caught me off guard. it wasn't what i was expecting at all. it's been a while since i've seen it but i do remember i could not stop laughing!!! and it wasn't just the cast that did it for me. the script was amazingly written. every time you were expecting something to happen it didn't happen. there were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious. the cinematography, along with the set, was absolutely beautiful as well. i really can't say anything bad about this movie! expcept, i would have andrew davoli a little more screen time!
