a matter of life and death, what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film. powell and pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions. the switches between the bold colours of "the real world" to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious, showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is. the final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter (david niven)'s operation. <br /><br />all of the performances are spot on (roger livesey being a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, never has there been a more romantic film than this (if there has i haven't seen it). a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is. and jack cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone, the way he lights kim hunter's face makes her all the more beautiful, what a genius, he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting. and the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time<br /><br />this is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences, but one of my all time favourites, which is why i give this film a 10/10, in a word - beautiful.
