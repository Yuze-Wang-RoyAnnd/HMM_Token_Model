reading all of the comments are very exciting. but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. i realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he hasn't gotten any credit in this sight yet. so if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist i would also like to tell him "job well done". i know this sight is for the good times cast but, wouldn't you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all. i would like to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive. i would like to have some of his work displayed in my home.
