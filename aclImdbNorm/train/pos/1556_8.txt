like other people who commented on "fr"aulein doktor" i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late-night tv without having heard of it before. the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the beginning.<br /><br />to me this is one of the five best movies about wwi (the others are "all quiet on the western front", "paths of glory", "gallipoli" and the post-war "la vie et rien d'autre"). and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling; the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks.<br /><br />i only wish i had taped the film.
