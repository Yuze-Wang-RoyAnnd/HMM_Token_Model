since i am so interested in lake monsters i really dug this movie. this movie is worth a see. if you like the so awful they are good types of films check it out. the effects are really good as well just think "land of the lost". i originally watched this movie in the early 90's maybe more like 89/90 on a local channel monster show called "morgus presents". i didn't scare me but i was 8 and anything b felt more like an a. years later i seen it on dvd at a local circuit city and bought it immediately so i can give it a 9 because it has a personal spot in my heart right there with the monster squad and gremlins. good b movie fun for all ages.
