i am only 11 years old but i discovered full house when i was about five and watched it constantly until i was seven. then i grew older and figured full house could wait and that i had "more important" things to do. plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too "girly." <br /><br />then i realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and i once again became addicted to it. full house has made me laugh and cry. it's made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of full house plus a mom. i have heard people say full house is cheesy and unbelievable. but look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver. the sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. the three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times. what's any more real than that? <br /><br />if anything the show has lifted me up when i'm down and brought me up even higher when i thought i was at the point of complete happiness. i have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over mary kate and ashley olsen. (of course hilary duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies i have ever seen. they are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.)
