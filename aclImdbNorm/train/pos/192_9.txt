prior to seeing show people, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only. i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls. but this masterful film proved me wrong. davies, in my view, was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball. i mention lucy primarily because davies' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies wasn't one of ball's primary influences. this is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy, and i must say that no matter how much of the period-specific references you actually get (i didn't, apparently), you will not be bored by this movie. you will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies. this is not only my favorite silent comedy, but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
