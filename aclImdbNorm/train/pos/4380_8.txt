this is a very good, under-rated action/drama/and slightly historical movie.<br /><br />the basic story concerns rob roy's borrowing of 1000 pounds, its theft, and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen.<br /><br />cunningham( tim roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil.<br /><br />rob roy (liam neeson) is excellent too, but i think the writers used the word "honour" 1 too many times.<br /><br />the rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed.<br /><br />the action is exciting and the sword play very realistic, but not too gory. the story is good and you really want rob to win.<br /><br />all in all just shy of a classic.
