at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing i'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'shaun of the dead'. now, given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, i realise this is a rather big claim. and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'fido' will appeal to you.<br /><br />in a way the comedy picks up where 'shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s living dead-era stereotypical middle-american small town. the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. this, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />the beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />it's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. it's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. it's also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like...<br /><br />so in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.
