on an overnight flight from los angeles to miami, lisa reisert (rachel mcadams) meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die.<br /><br />red eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. the premise is similar to cellular and phone booth but red eye is better than both of those films. almost everything about red eye is above average including the suspense, the acting and the direction. most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie. the film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots. wes craven does a really good job behind the camera. instead of focusing on the thrills, he focuses on the story and the characters. the movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about. i also like the way wes craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on. red eye really shows his skills at storytelling.<br /><br />red eye also works well because of its young and talented cast. rachel mcadams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate. you may even end up cheering for her out loud. cillian murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain. the way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive. the supporting actors are also pretty good which include brain cox and jayma mays.<br /><br />the movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it. the setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape. overall, the tone of the film is consistently creepy. the screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though. there are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer. most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head. also, the ending is disappointing. it isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better. since the movie focuses on the characters, there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps. if you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed. in the end, red eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer. rating 8/10
