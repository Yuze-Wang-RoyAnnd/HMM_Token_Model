a frolics of youth short subject.<br /><br />a teenager, embarrassed by his fear of dogs, runs away from home. the abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind.<br /><br />pardon my pups is an enjoyable little film, with shirley temple stealing all her scenes as the hero's lively kid sister. the opening gag - dealing with bedwetting - is in poor taste, but is quickly forgotten. highlight: the climactic fisticuffs, which look impressively realistic.<br /><br />often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios' feature films.
