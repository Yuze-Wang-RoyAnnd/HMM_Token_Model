the master blackmailer, based off of sir arthur conan doyle's short story, "the adventure of charles augustus milverton," is the first feature length sherlock holmes story with jeremy brett that i have seen. the story is interesting and dark. the film has a somewhat dreary, sad feel to it, but it is quite entertaining (with some especially funny scenes).<br /><br />*spoilers* sherlock holmes and dr. watson attempt to uncover the identity of an illusive blackmailer who has been ruining some of the most prominent families of england by publishing private letters that will, in one way or another, destroy their lives. they eventually find out that he is charles augustus milverton, an "art dealer," after the few tragic consequences for victims that could not pay up. our heroes must next help lady eva blackwell, who must pay a sum that is beyond her means or else her upcoming marriage will most definitely be called off. the scene in which holmes and watson burglarize milverton's house are intense. although the film has an essentially happy ending, the tone is sad and regretful.<br /><br />outstanding performances by jeremy brett and edward hardwicke (as usual), and robert hardy as the notorious villain (most audiences probably recognize him today as cornelius fudge in harry potter), serena gordon as lady eva blackwell, norma west as lady swinstead and sophie thomson as agatha (the scenes involving her and holmes are a riot). i give it a ***1/2 out *****. my only complaint is that there wasn't enough inspector lestrade. (i wish they would have added in the scene at the end of the short story where he gives the description of the two burglars, one of which matches watson.)
