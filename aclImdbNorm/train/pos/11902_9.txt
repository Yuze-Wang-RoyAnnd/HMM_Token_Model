this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle. he made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s-1960s that he sold with gimmicks. in "13 ghosts" you need viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the film was in b&w). "the tingler" had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre. "marabre" issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death! the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them. in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle, actors in his movies and his daughter. it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was (by all accounts he was a great guy). the documentary is affectionate, very funny and absolutely riveting. it's very short (under 90 minutes) and there's never a dull moment. a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans. my one complaint--there were very few sequences shown from his pictures. that aside this is just great.
