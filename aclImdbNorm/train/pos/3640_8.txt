this is one of my favorite sports movies. dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him. as a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he'll try out for a baseball team if they do. they win (partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour), and he keeps his side of the bargain--and is signed! <br /><br />if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult, jim morris's story will resonate with you. it is moving and inspiring, and the man's relationships ring true. <br /><br />inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one, though. dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part, and a baseball movie with a good-looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven. ladies, if you feel the way i do, check this one out.
