john travolta, the biggest honkeytonk in the world, and a mechanical bull...what more can you ask for! yeah, you're probably not going to get many surprises or deep meaning in this one. yet, i have always found it fairly enjoyable to watch this redneck romance. bud (travolta) and sissy (debra winger) meet at gilley's and fall in love. they have all the difficulties you might expect a hardcore redneck couple to have. the honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, mechanical bull riding, and -of course- the required brawls. it has a good, 1980 country soundtrack, featuring "looking for love in all the wrong places", "the devil went down to georgia", and "hello texas" by my favorite jimmy buffett. break out your cowboy boots and have a boot-scootin' boogie! <br /><br />*** (out of 4)
