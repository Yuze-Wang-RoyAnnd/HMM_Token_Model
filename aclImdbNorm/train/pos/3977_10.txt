i personally watched this to see the footage of the 60's and 70's. it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life. the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous. you feel like you're in on a secret and nodding your head at the same time...because it feels so good and familiar. i loved it, all segments from 60's-present day. i highly recommend this for all aspects, including rock music, the hipper movement, politics and good 'ol history. i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler, only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards, since i discussed what's in all 4 segments, so just wanted to be safe.
