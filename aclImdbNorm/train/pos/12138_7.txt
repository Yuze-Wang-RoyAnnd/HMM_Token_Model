several features of this film immediately date it. the sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years. the language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques.<br /><br />bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career. i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression. i think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me.<br /><br />somerset maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie-goers. as in so many of her character roles, bette davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred. leslie howard is well cast as the withdrawn english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress.<br /><br />towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street. they cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them. this scene is possibly meant to be funny, but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film. it is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face. and after all as far as we can see (and hope for) it is a happy ending.
