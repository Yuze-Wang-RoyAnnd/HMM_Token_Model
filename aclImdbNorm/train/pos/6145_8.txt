mary poppins is definitely much better, but this is a lovely film nonetheless. angela lansbury is splendidly dotty as engletine price, and david tomlinson has great fun as mr. brown. their chemistry was just brilliant as well. the children, however just lacked the same sparkle, though paul is very funny and cute. the songs were actually not as bad as some people say, "beautiful briny sea" is the best, in fact all the songs are outstanding. the special effects were wonderful, that had plenty of magic, and the story is original enough. the highlights, though, like mary poppins, were the animated sequences. the underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favourite was the football match, which was absolutely hilarious. the only other criticism was that i didn't quite get the ending when i first saw it. all in all, a lovely film, that is hardly ever on. 8/10 bethany cox
