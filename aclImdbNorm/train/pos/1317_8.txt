this anime was underrated and still is. hardly the dorky kids movie as noted, i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it. one of the better movies released.<br /><br />the animation while not perfect is good, camera tricks give it a 3d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground-breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon. it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view. it's a story to entertain, not to question.<br /><br />still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes. not to say its a childish movies, there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all.
