i know i should like this film, and i do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth. i to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying. it's a wonder they didn't start panting and howling at the moons as well. i also have to say that overall, the movie leaves me cold. it's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. on the plus side the effects are great (besides the cartoon monster), as are the effects, props, costumes and of course robbie. if the robot was not in this film, i don't think it would have been as popular as it was/is. the second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the "krell." as many times as i've seen this movie, the krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were. based on what was being produced at that time, besides "this island earth," forbidden planet is miles above the average sci-fi movies of the time. being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment. certainly a classic in its own right, flaws and all, and deservedly so.
