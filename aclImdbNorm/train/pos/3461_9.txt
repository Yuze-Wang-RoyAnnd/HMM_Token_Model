this columbo episode is probably noted more for the director, steven spielberg, as one of his early films. it should be looked at for jack cassidy's role as the murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. jack cassidy would appear in a later columbo. after all, columbo meets his match in jack cassidy's character. he is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder. after his first murder, his next victim would be the annoying general store owner/widow who would blackmail him for money. rather than losing more money, he kills her. it is very entertaining to watch cassidy and falk as always. falk's familiarity as columbo makes him watchable after viewing this episode repeatedly over the years. what television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters. it's not about who does it, how and why, it the familiarness of columbo and his likability which scores high with viewers like myself.
