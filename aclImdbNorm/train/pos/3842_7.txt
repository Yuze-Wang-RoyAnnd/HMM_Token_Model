an occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people's buttons., the 4th man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct. the story's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic catholic writer, gerard (krabbe), with a seriously twisted sense of imagination. verhoeven offers up<br /><br />gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man. he's shiftless, delusional, unable to control his urges, afraid to commit to<br /><br />meaningful relationships, and utterly apathetic about life in general. as the character himself states at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to recall the truth.<br /><br />the movie opens with gerard dreaming of spiders consuming christ, and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction. he chases off<br /><br />one man (a boyfriend presumably), then chases another at a train station. later, at a lecture, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, or<br /><br />perhaps she has more nefarious plans.. she quickly captures gerard in her web, enticing him with sex and money, having plenty of both. she's also got<br /><br />secrets, like three dead husbands. is she lonely, and genuinely looking for someone to nurture - or is she a deadly black widow, luring gerard to his<br /><br />death? will garard be the 4th man she kills? the woman is christine (soutendijk), and verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she's up to.<br /><br />this is an interesting movie, with a lot of sex and intrigue. it's similar to verhoeven's<em>basic instinct</em>, but has a lot more depth, and is certainly more shocking. there's a lot of very strong gay content, which may make some viewers squirm. highly recommended for fans of intelligent<br /><br />psychological thrillers, or anyone looking for something entirely new.
