an entertaining and substantive film, non-stop has drawn deserving comparisons with "run lola run". the film quickly develops into a chase sequence, during which the viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and daydream sequences. the chase serves not as as a fast-paced climax, but as a journey that makes up the majority of the film. during the "run" we see the characters grow and momentarily forget about their dreary lives, about the "macho" roles they've bought into, and eventually forgetting about why they started running in the first place. much like fighting provided a "clarity" for the characters in "fight club," running provides this film's characters with a means to step away from the false values that we all allow society to create for us. their running serves as way to truly taste life from an unclouded perspective, and all three find some level of clarity and joy in the process.<br /><br />my appreciation and enjoyment only wavered slightly in the ending of the film, where instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to revert to acting out those false macho roles i thought they had escaped from through their journey.<br /><br />still, the only true problem with this film is that it wasn't distributed outside japan sooner.
