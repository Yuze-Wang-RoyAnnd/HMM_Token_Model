in one of her first movies, romy schneider shines as young queen victoria of britain, as she is suddenly put into the throne at the age of 18, learns to govern despite the machinations of the politicians, and eventually romances and marries prince albert of saxony. kitschy and campy (though surprisingly faithful to the real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. seeing this movie about british royals spoken in german adds to its quaint charm. on that front, one wonders why an austrian movie was made about an english queen; but then one remembers that in 1954, austria was still under occupation by allied troops, including british ones. maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
