i was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to previous animated series (heidi, barbapapa, il etait une fois l'homme..., most of which i love). i find that other similar japanese cartoons of this kind released later can't match mazinger z, as they started to boringly repeat the same pattern.<br /><br />that very thing, the novelty, may be one of the best features of mazinger z. another good point is its inventiveness, with so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and bizarre characters; actually, we were eager to see each new installment to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us!
