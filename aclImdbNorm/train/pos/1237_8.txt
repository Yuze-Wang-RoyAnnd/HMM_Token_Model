this was a highly original decent movie, and a brave move for all those involved. i don't care if it's not the most well put-together movie of all time, the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non-formulaic, and that i don't know what will happen next, makes it a favorite of mine. i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one, rather than the same old formula for entertainment.
