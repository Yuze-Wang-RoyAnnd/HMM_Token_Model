on the contrary to the person listed above me i felt that this movie was really funny particularly in the scenes were there is a lot of mix up. i don't want to give the plot and the storyline away to the people that haven't watched it yet but i will say that paresh rawal does not have an extensive role such as past priyadarshan movies, for example, hera pheri and hungama. paresh rawal does an amazing part in the little role given to him, john abraham does equally well, akshay kumar has proved that he is no less in this movie like he had from waqt and almost all his movies after andaaz. even though all three heroins in this movie were at a debut they did a pretty good job of acting particularly nargis who is very good looking and hot. i would say that if you liked hungama or hera pheri this movie is a must watch.
