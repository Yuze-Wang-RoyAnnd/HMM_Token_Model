i didn't know the real events when i sat down to watch this, just the fact that this was based upon a true story. after the death of the kid's father, rhonda tries to help her daughter desiree(... i did not know anyone actually named their offspring that) cope with the loss. this is really made for children, as is often the case with "family" flicks(with that said, go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing, though i'd keep teenagers out of it, unless you're sure they're gonna buy the concept), but it doesn't downplay the sting that the death of a parent is, and it doesn't really talk down to anyone. the plot is sufficiently interesting, and moves along well enough. acting varies, with the excellent burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast, mathis following that pretty well, and ferland and her peers(with a few exceptions) being the least convincing of the bunch(and frankly, they're irritating; then again, i'm not really in the intended audience for this thing). the editing and cinematography are standard, and certainly not less than that. while humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so, the tone is not an unpleasant one. there is an intense scene or two in this. i recommend this to fans of these types of movies. 7/10
