i am frankly surprised how little has been done in film on the columbine massacre. there isn't a major documentary, very puzzling. fortunately we are graced with the talent of ben coccio who directed zero day, and gus van sant who did the equally fine elephant. two different takes on the event, which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there's something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers, and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality. zero day, purportedly made up of videotapes made by the shooters and found after the event, is absolutely riveting. even if you know where it's going, you still harbor hope that it won't "go there" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating. the film is terrific from top to bottom, from director to script (not much improvised, though it appears very spontaneous) to the two lead actors, and the supporting players as well. there is only one aspect of zero day that troubled me. okay, so we can't fathom why the shooters would do what they did, but certainly one of the contributors was their anger. yet these boys don't really seem angry. they may say some things to indicate that they are, but in fact they didn't convince me that they had something inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people. but this still leaves me with the sense of "why???" that director coccio wants me to have. anyway, rent or buy this movie, it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time. the blair witch folks could only wish for the kind of success these guys had at making a mock documentary.
