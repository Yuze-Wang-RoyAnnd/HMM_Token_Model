i am normally skeptical about watching films or mini-series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel. fortunately, i was wrong! the screenplay was very close to the novel (i guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?)<br /><br />the cast is outstanding. i can't describe how much i enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors (from ossie davis and ruby dee to robert ri'chard and bianca lawson).<br /><br />the location setting... i was expecting to see the homes and cottages i imagined in my mind: what i saw on screen was slightly different. however, it wasn't enough to make me dislike the mini-series.<br /><br />i recommend this for anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 8 out of 10 stars!<br /><br />
