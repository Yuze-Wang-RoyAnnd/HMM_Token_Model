"most of us at least inhabit two worlds , the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the world within ,the unconscious ,a safe place where we can escape ..." with those words ,mr .gone introduces inside the world of "the maxx" a fascinating world where the fantasy and the reality are combined . inspired in the comic books of sam kieth, "the maxx " is very faithful to the material in what it was inspired , not only in the story but also in the graphic style ,that look like the pages of the comic ,giving this show a surreal and unique appearance . but also ,the story it's interesting and entertaining .at moments it could turn too weird ,but when you got inside it ,it's hard to get out of it . the story and the characters are wonderfully developed . the music goes perfectly with the style of the show and give it the proper atmosphere . unfortunately , like many good animated shows ,this one was short -lived . "the maxx" is a must see . it 's one of my all -time favorites .
