this is a great movie for all generation x'ers. what a different world the america of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st century. you can get a sense of what an 1972 america gone by was like by watching this movie. i found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now. just think...back then there were only 4 or 5 tv stations to choose from. there was no aids, muslim terrorists, road rage, 911, bird flu, freeway snipers, etc, etc. the vietnam war was just over. there will still be 7 years before star wars comes out. the personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away.<br /><br />when this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it. so it began touring small protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors(this was the days before vcrs of course). the pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing a thief in the night to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film. then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room. members of the congregation would invite "unsaved" friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week. <br /><br />if you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value, then i think you will enjoy the film more. of course i am speaking as a gen xer. <br /><br />if i had a time machine i would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now.
