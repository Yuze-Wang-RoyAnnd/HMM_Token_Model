the movie shocked me. personally i had herd mostly bad buzz. well finally after owning the dvd for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night. though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes. the best thing about the movie is it's consistency with the relationship. there were no ex's popping up or characters threatening the relationship. i mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fate,they date,something we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow that mold. we actually experienced the relationship and it's flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti-love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again. i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies. the story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times.and it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also. it's no "my fair lady" but it is a spirited and honest film. i'll simply say i like it.
