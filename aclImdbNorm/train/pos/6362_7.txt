granted i had seen some "speed racer", but i never really watched it and i had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean vessel and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five. this one though i watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it. it actually ended, the bad guys done in unlike nearly every american cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one transformers that ended with galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get the autobots, dungeons and dragons with the kids never making it home, with gi joe with cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth. this one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed, it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons. as it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one android 16 used against cell in dragonball z, then that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out. then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. he would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called bobo in america. the villains not only consisted of dr. hell, but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head. interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion.
