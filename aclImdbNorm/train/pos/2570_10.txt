well, this is probably one of the best movies i've seen and i love it so much that i've memorized most of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit when jerry lee breaks wind) and even with the script in my head i still like to watch it for jerry lee, that german shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who's smarter. the tag line holds true as well. not to mention the acting is great, though christine tucci sounds different in a whisper (check filmography under csi if you don't know what i mean). it's too bad that this movie only contained the single issue dooley and jerry lee had to work with, it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that zeus and welles had up their sleeve.
