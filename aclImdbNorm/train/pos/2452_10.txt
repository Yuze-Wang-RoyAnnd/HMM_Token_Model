it's a good show, and i find it funny. finally the bad latin stereo types are over! !gracias, se~nor lopez! i love this show, and i just started watching it about three months ago. the whole concept about a latin family tv show really amazed me. i am surprised that finally latinos have a good shot to be on tv. this show is probably one the best i've seen, it's funny, heartwarming, touchy, and nice.
