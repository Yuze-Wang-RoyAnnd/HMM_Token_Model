hey guys i'm actually in this movie! i didn't even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised! i played pete, the main characters son. it was a great experience and i loved every minute of it. while filming they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a body double! the finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine. i still act and do some tv, but not as much. oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll.<br /><br />review: i thought the movie was okay but if i wasn't in it, it wouldn't be one of my favorites. i thought the acting was really good, but the story line was only so-so.
