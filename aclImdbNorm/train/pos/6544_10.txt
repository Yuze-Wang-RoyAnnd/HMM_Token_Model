i really liked this movie! even though it wasn't anything like any of the books it still the that classic nancy drew style. i had been seeing a lot of advertisements for this movie and since i was really into the nancy drew books i had really high expectations for this movie and they most definitely met those expectations. pretty much all of the characters were exactly how i pictured them from reading the books. i am really happy that i saw this movie. all of the actors and actresses really acted like they acted like in the book series. ever since i saw this movie i have wanted to read every single nancy drew book there is out there. all of the actors and actresses really got into their characters and it definitely showed when the aired this movie on the big screen. it definitely seemed like all of the actors and actresses were really in the positions that the characters were in i most definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10.
