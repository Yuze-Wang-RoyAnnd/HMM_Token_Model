it was fabulous! the photography, editing, cinematography, music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination. it was the enjoyment of "slumming," without going through the danger. we were there! the dream sequences and flashback-sequence-ending were fresh. it spoke to me. keep up the good work! another of that genre is city of god. also - don't laugh! - the comedy, desperately seeking susan. nice ensemble types, with great performances by all. sorry, i think training day fits that genre as well, with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast. i had to switch the channel on some of the gritty sequences, but all-in-all, a great film!
