this wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the spaghetti western so exciting and fun: great music (by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, nora orlandi), exciting action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and beautiful scenery and sets (all in almeria, spain, of course). it also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. the actors do marvelous jobs--with truly standout performances from lawrence dobkin and rosalba neri (in the most vital role for a female in a spaghetti western..outside of cardinale in leone's "once upon a time in the west"). without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film i have ever seen!
