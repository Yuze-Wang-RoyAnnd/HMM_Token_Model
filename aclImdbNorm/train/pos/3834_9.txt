a great film! slow: yes.<br /><br />...but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and horrifying, perfectly surreal (feels like a nightmare).<br /><br />i'd compare it to david lynch (eraserhead, inland empire, blue velvet) style maybe with mixed with a little bit of barton fink and naked lunch (insects!). also a bit of jodorowsky (fando y lis)....<br /><br />add some night on earth, angel heart and a bit of begotten, pi, (would it be wrong to mention tetsuo?) jacob's ladder, barker's the forbidden and salome - that should form together at least the concept of a dark night... nuit noire.<br /><br />if you're out for avantegardistic and/or surrealistic cinema (like i am) you're gonna like this one. if you're expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot - try your luck with something else.<br /><br />final words: the plot is very, very strange and unusual and that's probably the #1 reason why most people who don't appreciate this film hate it.
