reportedy based on actual historical events, this disturbingly violent, bloody, and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era. ms. bolkan's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force. her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences: her witnessing of the hated local duke's casual rapist activity, her forbidden love affair with a jew, her criminal defection to the invading moslem forces of the sensual prince ahmed (anthony corlan) there are some painfully realistic gory sequences (human flaying) in this film that are not for the squeamish, but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest. deserves to be seen, if only as an antidote to hollywood depictions of the medieval world.
