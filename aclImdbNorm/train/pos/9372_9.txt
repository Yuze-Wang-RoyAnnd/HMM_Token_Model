red rock west is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next. nicolas cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work. dennis hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better. look for a brief appearance by country singing star dwight yoakam. this is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments. what matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort!
