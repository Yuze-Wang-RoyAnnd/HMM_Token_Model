this is a really fun, breezy, light hearted romantic comedy. you cannot go wrong with meg ryan's cute perkiness combined with albert einstein's genius. normally, i'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people, now deceased and not able to defend themselves, but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one.<br /><br />it's the 1950's...princeton, new jersey in the spring. the story revolves around a pretty, young, scatter brained mathematician, catherine (meg ryan), who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk, a behavioral researcher named james, merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children. however, it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed (tim robbins). as she doesn't think ed is intelligent enough, her uncle, none other than albert einstein, plays match maker, assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies, all theoretical physicists. uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart, so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist...naturally with amusing results.<br /><br />walter matthau is his usual hilarious self, and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively. with his three professorial buddies, kurt, nathan, and boris, a lot of laughs ensue. the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one (outrageous) step further. if you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine this silly story happening!<br /><br />it might not be rocket science (despite its main character) but it is a wonderful sweet, refreshing movie. one of the best of the comedy romance genre.
