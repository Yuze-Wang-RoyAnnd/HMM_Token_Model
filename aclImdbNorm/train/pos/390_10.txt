the first thing i thought when i saw this films was: it is not really a film, at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word "film". it is entirely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not acquainted with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it's just a fairy-tale... and even a weird one, chaotic. for me "the legend of zu" is perfectly transparent. and i do like it. it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness, the fight that is as old as humanity, and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it. the film is obviously made by buddhists. i am not a buddhist. my religion and the vision of the world and human is different. but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other. it is a really beautiful film! and i which we had more films like this - films that have a meaning. there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly.
