i watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when i should have been asleep. this, in itself, was testimony that deliverance was a spell-binding movie. i think boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film. how expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done. it showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were. case in point - near the end of the "duel", the banjo-playing boy was smiling (loved his banjo), but when drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the "duel", the kid was too reserved to respond. the river trip never left you bored, for sure. the rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of georgia. i think beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done. some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal. i disagree - if you really payed attention, he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following, in which reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy. it was confusing when ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff. it almost appeared that the arrow was shot while ed was curled up and expecting to die, but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect.<br /><br />anyway, a great movie, and i was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a "1", i gave it a "10". this individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias, rather than an objective viewpoint, and his vote was obviously a non-correlating attempt to lower the rating.
