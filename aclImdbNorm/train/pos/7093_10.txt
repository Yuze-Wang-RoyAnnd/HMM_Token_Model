with 'twelve monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate. i know i did. the story is interesting and deals with time traveling. a virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named cole (bruce willis) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. in 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. there he meets jeffrey goines (brad pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. he also meets psychiatrist dr. kathryn railly (madeleine stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990. when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 kathryn starts believing cole's stories.<br /><br />the movie constantly plays with time. cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is picked up in the future and "they" send someone. for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call. things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention. you could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie.<br /><br />'twelve monkeys' works as sci-fi, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. may be it has some flaws in the story, but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. that was the easy part for me.
