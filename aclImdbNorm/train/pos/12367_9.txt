well, after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravo's the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film. the plot was simple, beautiful model alison parker (cristina raines) moves into an apartment building that's a gateway to hell. the sentinel is a down right creepy film, even if it's a bit slow. it's a mix of the omen and rosemary's baby. the acting is fine, and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals. it's a very odd, campy but in the end, i truly believe a great film! one of my favorites from the 70's, even if it's nothing greatly original. it's wacky and extremely creepy! probably one of my all time favorites. 9/10
