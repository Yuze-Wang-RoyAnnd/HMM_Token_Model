indian summer is a warm, multi-character film, that would make a fine afternoon film (with a bit of editing).<br /><br />the film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose, which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present, when a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp, uncle lou. the film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp, and form new memories in their latest stay.<br /><br />the film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting, and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments. watching these people reminisce, and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well. it never goes to over the top and melodramatic, always keeping its warmth, charm and realism. i've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well, and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself.<br /><br />for a warm, nostalgic character movie, i sincerely recommend.
