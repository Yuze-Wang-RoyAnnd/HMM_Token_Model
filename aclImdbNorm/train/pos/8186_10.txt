i love the satan pit!!! david tennant is such a great actor and so is billie piper!!! who else loves will thorp to pieces??? he is so cute, isn't he? i hated the bits where he got possessed by the devil and where he got told to "go to hell", as rose so bluntly put it. mind you, he was quite funny when he said, "rose, do us a favour, will you? shut up!". mr jefferson was so brave, wasn't he? dying to save the others. i felt really sorry for toby (will thorp) when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared. i was like "oh my god if i was rose i'd be so scared for him". and when she hugged him i was like "grrrrrr, he's mine! hands off!" but i thought that was really sweet. and the doctor....well, i thought he was gonna say to ida "tell rose i love her" but he didn't. oh well.
