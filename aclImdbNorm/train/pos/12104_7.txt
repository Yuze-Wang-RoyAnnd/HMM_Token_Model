well executed old and very dark house horror. good set-up which includes the character of poe, himself, alluding to the story in a london pub. although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people, it is still most enjoyable. plus we have the delightful and enigmatic barbara steele. there is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and bobs but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained throughout, that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along. dvd originates from us and has a few extras
