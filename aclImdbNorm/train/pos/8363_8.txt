this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series - it features all basics for a highly enjoyable wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies: although his majesty, mr. kinski, is missing you still have young joachim 'blacky' fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical clever american 'womanizer', you have young eddi arendt in his best (and just as well typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated british butler - and you have (not so young anymore) lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: highly entertaining) police investigator. furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), you'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives (please remind the time of its origin!), yelling scream queens, and on and on... all those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure german edgar wallace campyness - highly recommended!!
