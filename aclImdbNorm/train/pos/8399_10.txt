love trap is not a short, it's quite obviously a full length feature film with a running time of 105 minutes.<br /><br />while i'm writing this, i might as well talk a bit more about love trap. i'm frequently asked what makes love trap different... this is how i respond to that question: 1) it introduces characters - one in particular - that have never been seen before in film, period.<br /><br />2) it reveals more truth about love, and delves more deeply into the very concept of love, than any other u.s. film ever made, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />3) structurally, as in the way the story is told, it is unlike any love story you've ever seen.<br /><br />4) it offers extremely timely insights on various cultural issues, both within and outside the black community.<br /><br />over time, people will come to see love trap as about as wholly an original work as possible in this era, delightfully refreshing, authentic and honest. it is a rare morality play full of food for thought.<br /><br />please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate info about this film.
