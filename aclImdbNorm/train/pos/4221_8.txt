i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact. while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one, its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode, along with the uncovering of the murderer.<br /><br />the interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless. at one point, gordon, playing a famous writer, makes some comment about being flattered by the famous lt. columbo, making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detective's real life fame as a crime-solver. this is one of the best of many great columbo installments.
