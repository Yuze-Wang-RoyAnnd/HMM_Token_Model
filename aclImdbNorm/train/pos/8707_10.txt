"mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies i've ever seen. the name of the film can be translated in english as "the sword-bearer". the main hero (sasha) was born with one exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand. at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings. but it is not about mechenosets. he hardly can be even called the anti-hero. i think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good, justice and love. in his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him (except his mother). every his step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him. and suddenly he meets her. she doesn't need the idle talks and explanations. she loves him for what he is. she doesn't care what he did. the fact that he's next to her is more important than anything else. but soon she finds out his secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her before her very eyes. even after that she couldn't escape her feelings. they try to run but it's hart to hide. finally they have a serious car accident. he is caged; she is in a mental hospital. they don't know anything about each other, but she believes that he'll save her. he surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her. they run again but they aren't invulnerable. she is wounded, she needs a rest, but police almost catch them. he doesn't know what to do, they drive into a corner, and then his sword begins to cut down trees, helicopter around them, but there is no need for it, because she is already dead in his arms, and he is the lonely person in the whole world again.
