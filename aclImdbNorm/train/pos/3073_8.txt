this is the kind of movie hollywood needs to make more of. no extravagant props, no car chases, no clever one-liners. just people dealing with being people.<br /><br />william macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father, donald sutherland. macy is the dutiful son, sutherland is the domineering father. son wants out of the business, father won't let him. macy loves his own son, played beautifully by david dorfman ("the ring"). he also starts to fall in love with neve campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office.<br /><br />it's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family. there are many touching scenes, especially between macy and his little boy. and as you'd expect in a film with william macy in it, there's a bit of humor too.<br /><br />excellent job all around, actors and director. nice to know they can still make a good film in hollywood on a small budget.
