"match point" and now "scoop" have both convinced me that not only is woody allen doing a neat job making movies in england (and that scarlett johansson is the right cast member), but corroborated what i have known for years: he shouldn't focus on neurotic rich new yorkers. in this case, johansson plays journalism student sondra pransky, whom magician sid waterman (allen) puts in his disappearing box, where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter joe strombel (ian mcshane), who tells her that the serial killings that have plagued london were committed by millionaire peter lyman (hugh jackman). so, she gets to know him, and...well, i don't know how much i can tell you without giving it away. but i can say that this is probably allen's funniest movie in years. there's his ubiquitous unique style of humor (especially the line about his religion).<br /><br />so, you're sure to like this movie. if nothing else, it'll make you fall in love with london. but mostly, it's just so damn hilarious. even if you don't like woody allen, you gotta love this one.
