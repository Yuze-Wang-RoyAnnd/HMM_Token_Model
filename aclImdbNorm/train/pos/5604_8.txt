if you liked roman polanski's "repulsion", you should probably check out "the tenant" since it's a similar concept, just with polanski stepping in and playing the schizophrenic wacko. this is actually one of my favorites of his movies - second, after "rosemary's baby", of course - and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim. the other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers on keeping the noise level down - even the slightest 'titter' becomes a big deal and polanski, who stars, becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on. it gets to the point where he is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize it's only a matter of time before he decides tor re-enact her fatal leap out the window... the film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while, but if you have ever seen a roman polanski movie, you should know it's going to end with a bang and this flick doesn't disappoint. it's also best if you don't question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness, because it's pretty trippy surreal at times. polanski is very good as the timid, deranged resident who, somehow, attracts the ever illustrious isabelle adjani. we also get to see him running around in drag, which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time! damn, he makes for one ugly chick! so, polanski fans - who can actually look past his thirty year-old pedophile charges - should enjoy "the tenant" as an entertaining psychological head-trip...
