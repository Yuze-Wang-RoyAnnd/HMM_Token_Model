this comic book style film is funny, has nicely paced action and a great futuristic style to it. writer steven de souza, who also wrote commando, gives arnie plenty of lines to dish out: "send me a copy," after signing a contract and stabbing a pen into the lawyers back; "what a pain in the neck," after strangling subzero with barbed wire; "he had to split," after slicing his body between his legs; and finally, as killian slams through a billboard bearing his own face, arnie concludes, "now that hit the spot." funnily enough, bears some similarities total recall, another sci-fi flick starring schwarzenegger.
