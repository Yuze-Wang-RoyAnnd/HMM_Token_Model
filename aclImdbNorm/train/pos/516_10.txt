one of the few best films of all time. the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial excellence.<br /><br />the plot is extremely clever, the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions, and although a war film it doesn't discriminate. i must have seen this film more times than any other, and i never tire of it. it is a film that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs on what happens after our demise.
