at first, i thought the ring would be a more than normal movie with it's ordinary plot. how surprised was i! of course, the plot is simple - one girl is in love with two men - but hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter, with laughter and fear, with compassion and anguish. the way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair, the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men, the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest movies(north by northwest, the rope, etc.). the master did it great even before his thirties!
