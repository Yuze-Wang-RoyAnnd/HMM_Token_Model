me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so demanding to watch. however the movie greatly exceeded my very low expectations.<br /><br />it is so much more than just a representation of a century. it has very real portrayals of the characters within it and most of the actors do an amazing job. the different stories are baked together with actual footage from the time that gives it a very unique touch. while watching it i really felt that i cared about what happened to the characters.<br /><br />i would also like to give endless amounts of praise to julia stiles in her portrayal of katie, she was great in a way that stood out!<br /><br />i would recommend this movie to anyone..
