tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in vietnam in 1971.<br /><br />at this point, america knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'tigerland' training camp in louisiana.<br /><br />the film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character roland boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. we are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.<br /><br />i'd have to say this is a great story about vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. great acting, and very memorable. also the directors use of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding vietnam. its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle. the particular scene where boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility.<br /><br />fantastic film. not just about nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.<br /><br />rating 9 out of 10.
