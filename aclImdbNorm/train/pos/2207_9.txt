not a bad word to say about this film really. i wasn't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly. i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people can't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories, mine being one of them. the film delivers in the shock, gore and atmosphere department. the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus. it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business. the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard, if a little wooden in some spots, and the effects are very real and gritty. all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book. i've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer's p.o.v shot. and i ask: what's wrong with that??? it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer's identity a secret. the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist(killer revealed) is not handled with more care, i mean it just happens kind of quickly, though the great performances make it just about credible. aside from that pranks is a great movie (though i prefer the original title) and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap. its more than that, but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher. what a shame.... its a really good movie people! believe me!
