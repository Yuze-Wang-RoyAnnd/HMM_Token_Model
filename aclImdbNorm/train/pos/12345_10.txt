kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any shakespearean drama, and the acting is true to the story, with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale. it is touching, funny and intriguing in all parts. the character development is near perfect, the cinematography is vivid and engaging, and the story draws you in.<br /><br />i would like to say that the "samurai freaks" and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of japan may snub this film as not kurosawa's best work. perhaps not his best, but even at his worst, kurosawa is better than many of the best. this story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change, that it is timeless, despite being set in the not-so-distant past.<br /><br />i would heartily recommend this to any movie buff, and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based.
