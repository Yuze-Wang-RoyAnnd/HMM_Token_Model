now this is what a family movie should be! there are few films of recent years that have been targeted at families or children that really are worthy of their viewing public; but this is one of them. my whole family came away from the film, awed, entertained, dazzled, and happy. we're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there. the children loved it and so did we (hubbie and i are 36 and 32, respectively)!<br /><br />apart from its beautiful and striking animation, the characters (small as they may be, and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. there isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with. the personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents, combined with the skill and artistry of some of disney's best animators. this is a film worthy of walt disney, himself. i think mr. disney would heartily approve of this new film... flick, dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as mickey and minnie in our time.<br /><br />this is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again.. and buy to own on video or dvd. i'm eager to see it again.. to pick up what i might have missed the first time. (never have i seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before... my daughter is still talking about little "dot".)<br /><br />this film is funny, heartwarming, clever and great fun for the whole family!
