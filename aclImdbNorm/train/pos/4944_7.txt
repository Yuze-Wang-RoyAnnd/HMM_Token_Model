not that much things happen in this movie but a lot of meanings. the woman thought she had all that she can in life, but that was indeed not true, and she found out herself when she met this person who was conducting some research for his next job. there really should be more types of movies like this, im not even that old as considered "mature" ( im 13 by the way) and i still got the idea and point of the film. the main point is in my opinion: don't think you can't have a better life, just because you currently have this one.<br /><br />though i got to admit i was thinking of watching another movie but after reading all the reviews and seen the trailer i decided on this one even though i knew not that much action would appear in the film. i recommend anyone to watch this movie as it has very good points in the film, and is a really good ending.
