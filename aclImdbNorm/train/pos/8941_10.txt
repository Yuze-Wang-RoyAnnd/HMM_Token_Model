i really enjoyed watching this movie about the delany sisters. i knew of them, but that was all. this movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. what a pair. what sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms. this is not only a movie for african americans, but for all americans. it is sort of a history lesson and a documentary rolled into one and combined with an entertaining movie biography. the acting was superior by all included and we really do get a glimpse of the hardships these two sisters went through for many years. both sisters are quite different from each other. they came from a very loving and very strict family with high, maybe even impossible standards of perfection. it is sad to see how sadie's father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding. i thoroughly recommend this movie and i am glad i caught it on television the other day.
