despite some negative comments this film has garnered in the imdb pages, it's still worth a look as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while in a difficult mission in the panamanian jungle.<br /><br />peruvian director luis llosa takes us along to watch this thriller set in panama. the film has some good moments as beckett, the veteran marine, takes a newly arrived man, recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious drug cartel head and the corrupt army general who might be the next president of the country. the only problem, miller, has no experience in what he has been entrusted to achieve.<br /><br />miller, the arrogant newly arrived man to the jungle and to the guerrilla warfare between the military and drug lords against the infiltrated american intelligence men, learns a valuable lesson from beckett. what looks good in theory, is irrelevant in the jungle.<br /><br />tom berenger, is an actor who doesn't register much, as he proves in this movie, but in the context of the movie, he is right as a man of a few words. billy zane playing miller does what he can with a role that doesn't afford him any glory until the crucial end.<br /><br />for lovers of action film, "sniper" offers an 112 minutes of action that with a bit of trimming would have made a more satisfying movie.
