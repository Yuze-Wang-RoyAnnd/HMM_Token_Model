inspector "dirty" harry callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of san francisco. however, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.<br /><br />as an entry in the dirty harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments, including the legendary "go ahead, make my day" line that eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery. very badass and it just what fans can expect from him. however, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. the problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as harry is. this really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, magnum force.<br /><br />on the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans that were looking for another badass harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. however, a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different, it is a good movie for fans. --- 7/10<br /><br />rated r for violence and a rape scene
