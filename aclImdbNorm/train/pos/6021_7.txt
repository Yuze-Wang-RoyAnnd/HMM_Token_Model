though this may not necessarily be a so-called "classic" film by today's standards, it's still worth seeing. the main reason why is because after experiencing this film, you get the feeling that you've also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 60's, no matter however good or bad.<br /><br />i happened to see this film in an english literature class at suny geneseo, and though at first it appears to be just a meaningless composition of 60's icons, the film is far from being simply "thrown together".<br /><br />my point is that if you leave the film feeling unsatisfied and confused, the film has done it's job: it's conveyed a desolate view of the future that leaves you feeling unsure and angry. it was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it exemplified.<br /><br />as such, "zabriskie point" may not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters may be one-sided and predictable. however, it also conveys so well this sort of clich'ed, rebellious desire to get out of the existence which both mark and daria must share. even the anti-establishment students are as inauthentic as the gov't they rebel against.
