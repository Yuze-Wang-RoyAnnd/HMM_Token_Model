this movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few african americans are aware. my own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skin woman whose parents were ex-slaves. he married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight; raising 8 children during the great depression of 1929; providing the family with food whenever she could. of course she clandestinely aided this family fearing for her own ex-communication. my daughter was fascinated by the movie. we have made it a part of our library.
