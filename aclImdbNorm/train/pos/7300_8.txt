like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title, michael oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and ponderous. the producer's last outing, "mosquitoman-3d" had the same problem. it's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow managed it. the only draw for hammerhead: shark frenzy was it's passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the ocean's surface. but even that was only passable. poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish. with dolphins and whales, the technology is all but wasted. cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imax's stunning 3d capabilities. there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety. close-ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field, so there is no contrast of depth. michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you've got shark-week on cable, his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
