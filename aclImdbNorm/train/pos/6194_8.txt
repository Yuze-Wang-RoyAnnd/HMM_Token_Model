henry fool surprised me. i didn't expect it to entertain and amuse as well, or as strongly, as it did. fay grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to a story that seems not to need it. once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie, however, it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequels to brilliant indie film. at least as good as ginger snaps back, if not better.<br /><br />i am a little disappointed that jeff goldblum's part is so small, but i'm happy he is a part of this short run. he is convincing and delightful as agent fulbright. also a delight is liam aiken who quite aptly portrays ned grim, the son of fay and henry.<br /><br />this movie is a pleasure for so many reasons. i am pleased, for example, to discover that henry isn't really the loser he seems (by the end of fool), and to further discover that he is, in fact, a genius...well, that really is a lovely stroke of the pen.<br /><br />i am hoping they do a third...like the end of the trilogy. it seems to be missing. they should entitle it ned fool grim and it should be liam looking for his father, to validate the awesome change in his mother, and the sense of near-genius he himself feels welling inside him. assuming, of course, that fay continues withholding many of the most important facts from her son, concerning his father. it feels like it needs to be done. i'd buy it.<br /><br />even with more action, this is still not an action flick. it is more drama and intrigue...a mystery, of sorts. i'll watch it often.<br /><br />it rates an 8.3/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
