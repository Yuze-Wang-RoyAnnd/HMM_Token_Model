this movie was one of the funniest movie i've seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me. not since my big fat greek wedding (2002) has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense. easily has intricate as last year's mr. and mrs. smith (2005) in its use of parody (espionage in mr. and mrs. smith and sex in my super ex-girlfriend). director's ivan reitman balance between comedy and drama, between crazy and downright ludicrous is great. never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy. at the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance. in some ways, it's so evident that it's great to see how it plays out. just like in real life, sometimes the truth is so evident that one can't really see it. easily eight out of ten stars ranking up there with tootsie (1982). possibly a nine (depends on how it appears on a second viewing).
