the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly's "i'll take you there" is not overt, but clearly has ties to his work (shelly has acted in two of hartley's films). not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative, but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light. though this film is not ironic on the whole (thank god), the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss. with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies, "i'll see you there" is a great indie-film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion.<br /><br />the film begins with bill's life falling to pieces. not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home, but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat. all washed up, bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy (played by the director adrienne shelly) brings him all kinds of surprises: a self-help book and a "date" for her traumatized brother.<br /><br />the unwilling bill tries to refuse, but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice. no doubt bernice's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to "rebound" with her. however, her pseudo-hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date. and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him, forcing herself upon him. to what end, we are not aware... except for maybe the fact that she is psycho. (and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy?)<br /><br />aware that bill desperately wants to see rose, bernice offers her car, but on the condition that he take her somewhere first. on the way, she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun (a pinkerton detective, no less). an imbroglio of angst, resentment, redemption, passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose... of course, with a few stops along the way.
