a strangely enjoyable effort, combining an appropriately far-fetched plot involving adam and burt and flashbacks to the original tv series. most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from burt ward's book "boy wonder: my life in tights" and i imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie. like the book, it left fans of the original series hungering for more.<br /><br /> if you missed this broadcast, it is definitely worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who may have recorded it. i'm making a copy for my kids right now.
