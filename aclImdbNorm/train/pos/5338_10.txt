if i'm going to watch a porn movie, i prefer it to have some sort of plot, and a descent dialogue. behind bedroom doors is one of the few i've come across with those attributes.<br /><br />the new girl next door scams on the neighbor's human nature and weaknesses where seduction and sex concerned. chelsea blue,(i mean brooke lavelle) is the choice actress to play the part of the blackmailing seductress, and plays the part magnificently. chelsea blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. the movie get's an overall 10 just because she is in it. her partner in the movie, monique alexander is a definite cutie. the two should do more work together. in this movie, though, monique, who plays gigi, doesn't have a whole lot to do or say. that's too bad. she seems like she has more talent to be shared. i like the girl who was the (possible) da's wife next. i forget her name, but she's pretty good looking, and not a bad actress. nicole sheridan...i'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about. it's obvious there are parts of her bought an paid for. which is okay, but is she finished? sorry, but come on! i'm afraid her performance here would have dropped the rating some, except chelsea's talent and beauty overrides any negatives. overall, this movie is a good one.
