it is a tricky thing to play a queen. on the one hand, the actress has to be majestic and imperious, and on the other, she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds, since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line. <br /><br />emily blunt is quite radiant as victoria, but it's not as full a performance as i'd like, no blame to her. i can't help but feel like this is a mills & boon novel adaptation compared to a darker, more dramatic movie about another young queen, elizabeth. hence blunt doesn't get to run the gamut of queenly emotions, at least not to the full extent, since she's, y'know, the young victoria. to see the old victoria, check out mrs brown.<br /><br />jean-marc vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie. he last did c.r.a.z.y., which was excellent and propelled him to fame. it was quite a different movie but i remember it looking gorgeous and that's probably the main similarity between the two movies. but while vallee wrote c.r.a.z.y., this one was by julian fellowes, and though i really enjoyed his gosford park, the story for this movie was much less interesting. i soon got lost with all the governmental politics. maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy. i'm just saying.
