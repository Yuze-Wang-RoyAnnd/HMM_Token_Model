love hurts. that, i think, is the main message mike binder's newest film reign over me brings across. whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant, or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years, or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world, love hurts. the great thing about this film, however, is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go, but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future. no one in this drama is perfect; they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can't free themselves from alone. there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe, but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character-based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead. what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 9-11 effected us all, ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret.<br /><br />this is a new career performance for adam sandler. i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish, pent-up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically. the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor, but also can be used to show a repressed man, shy and shutout to the world around him
