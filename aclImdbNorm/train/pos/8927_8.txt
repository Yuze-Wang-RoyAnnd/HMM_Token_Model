clair denis again revisits her theme of estranged fathers, men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion, heedless of the emotion toll on their family but while n'enette and boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of marseilles, our examination of louis trebor in the intruder takes us from a remote location along the french-swiss border to half way around the world, to korea and tahiti. again the film begins in mid stream, with louis, in his sixties, coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness. we learn that louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence. louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby. denis is in no hurry to move the action along, and we must patiently build our understanding of louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son, sidney (gr'egoire colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache) who rejects him as a "lunatic":, shown as a dedicated father of two. there are many brief scenes which, while seemingly unrelated, build up an impression of louis and his milieu. ms godard's camera work is exhilarating here. the controlling metaphor is louis's heart transplant for which he goes to korea and then to tahiti to search for another son, not found, and where louis's new heart rejects him just as sidney rejected the old. we are accustomed to brief scenes in denis's film which are inexplicable: n'enette astride boni feeding with a spoon; a drive by shooting of boni's father and then the briefest of images of boni with a gunshot wound in the head; a scene of louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of sidney. the implication, of the last two, is a rejection, real or imagined, by a father, kills something indefinable in a son.
