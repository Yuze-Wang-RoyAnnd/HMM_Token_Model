i have always enjoyed the pokemon movies. yes, i know, all of them are very corny, mediocre in some certain areas and sure, even though they're aimed at little kids they're too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement,"hey, lighten up, it's a kids movie," but all that aside, aren't they still good pieces of entertainment? in my opinion, they are so and i enjoy them greatly. this one is just as enjoyable as the previous three, and certainly cuter. it has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable, fresh pokemon celebi. it's not the best pokemon movie, but i do enjoy it more than the third installment, even though the third is not bad, and the entire series is just entertaining, harmless, popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more, nothing less. this film has some high marks of intensity and interest, especially around the climax/ending, as do all the installments, and the characters, while a bit more lackluster than the previous three, i thought, are still likable and humorous. this films is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four feature length adaptions, and it doesn't deserve that.
