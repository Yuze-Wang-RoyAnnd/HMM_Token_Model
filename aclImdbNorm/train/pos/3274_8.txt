this is one of three 80's movies that i can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately, still overlooked. one of the others was clownhouse directed by victor salva, a movie horribly overlook due to salva's legal/sexual problems. another would be cameron's closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated--not great, but not nearly as bad as the reviews i've seen. paper house is well worth your time and i think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think. i mean, 10 years after i've seen it and i still give it some pause, whereas something that i might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the ether.
