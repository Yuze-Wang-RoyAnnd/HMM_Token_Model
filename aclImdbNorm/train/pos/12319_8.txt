first things first, the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed. now actress wang zu xian, the one who played xiao qian in the movie, is 42 years old and well aged. it's always good to review these glorious times when seeing old-school hongkong productions like this.<br /><br />the movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s. the art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing. more fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it. it feels like a horror movie but ultimately it's not scaring, but only fun.<br /><br />i had the experience of translating the second script of "a chinese ghotst story", and i thought that script was a decent write. however when i saw the movie, i firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script, like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles. however, it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertaining.<br /><br />if you have seen the lord of the rings, you will notice the similarities in this movie to lotr. the climax is like a mirror of miranda otto fighting with the ring witch. it's definitely a laugh-out-loud. bravo!
