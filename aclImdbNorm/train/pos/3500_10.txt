this movie works because it feels so genuine. the story is simple and realistic, perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that most/all of us experienced during our teen years.<br /><br />the actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers. the dialogue is fresh and honest... and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references. also, the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful, bringing the lower east side setting to life in a very tangible way.<br /><br />on an artistic level, i love this movie because it reminds me of great italian neo-realism films like the bicycle thief and la strada. movies rarely feel as "real" as this does ... or as bicycle thief did. and the only other movie i've seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is elia kazan's splendor in the grass. writer/director peter sollett deserves tremendous praise. this film is quite an achievement.<br /><br />on a personal level, i am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic america with love and respect. as an italian-american, i hate the way my own people come off in the cinema (as racist, womanizing, criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics), and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations. hispanics and asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in westerns and action movies. (good thing gong li didn't try to become famous in america!)<br /><br />of course, thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures, and the influence of miramax, we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there ... but raising victor vargas is easily one of the best. while i do really like my big fat greek wedding, it is a refreshing change that raising victor vargas is played straight (with less exaggerated and broadly-drawn characters) while still being very funny in its own right. finally! latino characters worthy of note. i have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered.<br /><br />of course, now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the dominican republic, i hope peter sollett gets around to making a movie about italians soon! :) - marc dipaolo
