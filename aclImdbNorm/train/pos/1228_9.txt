this 1991 nbc-tv movie aired six months before john goodman's big-screen version of the life of babe ruth came out. for my money, there is no comparison between the two. the tv production isn't perfect but it presents the babe's story with more depth and complexity than goodman's one-dimensional telling. i especially enjoyed the film's depiction of the complex love-hate relationship ruth had with yankee manager miller huggins, who always understood his star player's brilliance and also kept trying to point out why ruth's own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players. the tv-movie rightly notes how ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the yankees because of his flaws, while the horrible goodman version tries to push the falsehood that ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking.<br /><br />this film makes a great companion piece to "eight men out" since the story starts with ruth's arrival in new york in 1920, one year after the black sox scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin. indeed, the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with john anderson reprising his "eight men out" role as commissioner kenesaw mountain landis.
