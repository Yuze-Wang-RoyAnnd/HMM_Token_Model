incredibly intriguing and captivating, i found it impossible to turn away once i began to watch. i am usually one of the harshest critics but to me this film was just brilliant, strange as this may sound i could almost smell the air and feel the textures of the locations. <br /><br />from a cinematographic i thought there was great use of light and texture. from the orange glow of the summer light, down to the plastic wrapped couch all had a distinct air of realism to me.<br /><br />from a character perspective i thought the notion of victor vargas as almost the glue that connects the story was quite inspired, each of the other members of the family having a more complete background simply caused greater intrigue in the main character himself.<br /><br />beyond that, having known someone just like the grandmother and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation, i can say the situation felt particularly realistic. the awkwardness, the accent, the cooking and even down to the comments made felt so authentic to me.<br /><br />i think this film worked for me because i began to watch it with no expectations and found it completely immersing and brought back memories of teenage emotion, well worth a watch.
