at the start, this one is from england, so, of course, i had 98 % chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema. i never heard of this film before. from the minute i saw helena bonham-carter, i said to myself : oh! here's comes the feminine version of my left foot. i was right, but i was also wrong. wrong because the two movies are very differents. my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie (not because this is funny, but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes.) i was right because in 1990 handsome daniel day-lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality. here, very beautiful bonham-carter did exactly the same thing, but with very feminine emotions. the story is well written and it's very intelligent. for me, miss bonham-carter gives one of the greatest woman's part of the 1990's, with emily lloyd in breaking the waves. gee! and look at her eyes! she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since jobyna ralston, louise brooks, michele morgan and ava gardner! she's also a true talent, as seen on many other movies. see this one, you won't regret it! and a very fine job by branagh too!
