in this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies. this is amusing at first, but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances, how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable.<br /><br />characters often interact in a peculiar way, with no tact or manners or respect. i believe this is intentional, not bad acting. after all, who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city's inhabitants behave like that.<br /><br />i didn't like most of the action scenes, apart the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies. the plot isn't too polished. but the great scenes and ideas - like the death of sol, the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with, the "furniture" - outweigh the shortcomings of this film.<br /><br />8 out of 10.
