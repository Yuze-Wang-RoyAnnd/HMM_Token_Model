i had seen lady with red hair back when it appeared, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. the truth is that, notwithstanding its base in a true story, its screen play is silly and unbelievable. the real merit of the picture is the cast. a constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underrated miriam hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of claude rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in the picture. what an actor! he never won an oscar, but he is in the good company of chaplin, garbo and hitchcock. perhaps lady with red hair contains his best work in films. see it and enjoy him.<br /><br />
