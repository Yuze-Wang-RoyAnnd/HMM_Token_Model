i would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what were the flaws as i am not a professional film critic and i do not have enough knowledge of making movies. what i do know is that making this kind of a movie in your very first shot is a big achievement and i would like to congratulate the director for that. however, in some reviews, that i have read, critics have complained that hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted, and his siblings were completely erased from the story. now i would really like to raise a point here that as the name of the movie suggests, it is not a movie about hiralal's brothers, it is a movie on the relationship of mahatma gandhi and his son hiralal gandhi, nothing more nothing less. if we start complaining about some characters being kept out of action in the movie, it would be a bit unfair because these characters don't fit in the picture, no matter how relevant they were in real life. so i think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfy a critic in ourselves.<br /><br />enjoy!!!!
