i came home late one night and turned on the tv, to see siskel and ebert summarizing their picks of the week. i didn't hear anything about "red rock west", except two thumbs up and see it before it went away. it wouldn't stay in theaters very long because of the distributor's money problems and lack of promotion, but they said it deserved better.<br /><br />the next afternoon, i followed their advice. they were right, it was some of the most fun i have ever had at the movies. as some readers point out, there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes don't ever seem to end. but it's well worth it, for the fine craftwork that went into the first hour. it's the best role that i have ever seen for nicholas cage, but almost everybody seems perfectly cast. dennis hopper goes almost over the top, which gets silly but reinforces how well everything else works. the sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scene.<br /><br />when i rented it later for my family, it didn't work as well. the long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate, with the distractions at home. it deserves your full attention; turn off the phone, make sure you won't be disturbed, watch and listen to every scene, especially in the beginning.
