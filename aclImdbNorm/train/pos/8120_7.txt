things to come is an early sci-fi film that shows an imagined world, or "everytown" through 100 years. you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the "boss" wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again, after everytown was bombed and war broke out.<br /><br />this film only has about 3 faults: it's audio is muddy and video had some quirks, the characters aren't deep at all, and the overall plot isn't altogether solid. the plot is lacking something that i can't put my finger on... it just seems a little "fluffy." but if you love sci-fi and are interested in what h.g. wells though might happened in the next hundred years, this is a must see. it's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing: a long, drawn-out war, because they were just about to go to war with germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything.<br /><br />things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.
