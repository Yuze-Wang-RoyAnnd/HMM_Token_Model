when this first came out, my dad brought it home- we were amazed by it- it was so different from anything we had seen before. i was looking for a specific movie last night, and i found "the mind's eye" again. the box is falling apart, and i am surprised that the tape still works! although it is not 'finding nemo' quality graphics, it is still very good. they should sell this again- it is a landmark for computer animation imagery. highly recommended!<br /><br />this is what it is:<br /><br />"the mind's eye" is a spectacular odyssey through time. your journey begins at the dawn of creation and moves through the rise of man and technology. travel in the world of abstraction and on into the future with breathtaking computer animation imagery.<br /><br />"the mind's eye" joins the imaginations of over 300 of the world's most talented computer animation artists with a powerful, original music soundtrack. this unique collaboration takes you on an incredible voyage into "the mind's eye."
