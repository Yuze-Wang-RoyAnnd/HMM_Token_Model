our imp of the perverse did good his first time out, thats for sure. the music is the best you may ever hear by any human, but you already know that, unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness. a poor script that doesn't flesh out much of a story, but at least it has its moments. the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it. he deserved an oscar for this s**t, even though he was at times an ego driven twit, with his towering bodyguard chick huntsbery always in front. a movie that made non-fans fans, take it or leave it. prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though. he takes himself way to serious. he is a genius musician, but pleaseee..just enjoy the ride, my purple maestro..peace.
