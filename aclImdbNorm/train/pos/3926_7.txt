plotwise this is a rather silly little whodunnit masquerading as a period drama/biopic.<br /><br />however the only reason i wanted to see it in the first place was because i was curious about what the great henry fonda was really like at his peak. i wasn't disappointed - he produces a truly warm and charismatic performance.<br /><br />in addition i can honestly say that i was never really bored at any stage during the film, so a strong ***1/2 out of *****
