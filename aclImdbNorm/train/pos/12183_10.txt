one reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what welles actually says or does, he moves you. i concur. he was and remains a unique force in film. more than a triple threat who could act, write and direct, he had a genius uniquely suited to film. one can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter. this film certainly reinforces that impression. a musician, a theatre actor, an heir to shakespeare? hard to tell but i am very grateful that his time cam with film and he have him captured on film. i like the accent. i like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. i love all of his movies and wish there were more. i particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film. many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o firmly there. even towards the end when his beauty was ruined, perhaps by his own intent, he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in. rita was a gorgeous blonde -- a lana turner look alike but perhaps even lovelier and even then the eye goes to welles and one wishes for another minute, another film, another hour in his company. that is why we all wish we could come upon the lost scraps cut from his films because we know, we all know, that there is not part of him not worthy of our time. watch it and be grateful for the chance.
