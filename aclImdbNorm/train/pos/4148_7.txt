let's set one thing straight: this movie does not seek to redefine the genre, it's not dr. strangelove o young frankenstein. it's a silly flick, with three great female leads (can't remember any other comedy with similar characteristics), rachel dracht and amy poehler from snl and indie queen parker posey, charming as ever. the story is basic: the three gals were "losers" in college, and are still after wards it. poehler is a dog trainer (who can't even get a date with a blind guy), posey is an assistant for a senator (who "hasn't been touched by a man since clinton was in office"... i catched that one several minutes later... i'm a little slow, ok!), and dracht has a gay fianc'ee (seth meyers from snl, funny). they have to prevent the "uncool" daughter of the senator (the always cute amber tamblyn from the tv series "joan of arcadia") to embarrass her during spring break. so of course they have to go to watch over her, and some hilarity ensues. all in all, a light, simple comedy, quite short, and quite enjoyable
