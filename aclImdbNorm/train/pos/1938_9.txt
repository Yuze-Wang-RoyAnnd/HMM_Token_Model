the big bad swim has a low budget, indie feel about it. so many times i start to watch independent films that have had really good reviews only to find out they are pretentious crud, voted for by people who are so blinded by the idea of the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that film is a form of entertainment first and foremost.<br /><br />i do not know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor, if it does then i missed it.<br /><br />from the get go bbs felt right, it was easy and warm and human, there were no major dramas or meaningful insights, i just connected with the characters straight off. and when, as with all good films the end came around i felt sadness at the loss of that connection.<br /><br />if you are looking for something big, or fast or insightful look elsewhere, look for a film trying to deliver more than it can. bbs delivers a solid, enjoyable, real experience and i felt rewarded and satiated having watched it.
