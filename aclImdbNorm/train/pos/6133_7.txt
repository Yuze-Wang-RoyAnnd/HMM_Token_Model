easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time. i first saw this movie when i was around nine years of age, and i have to say that it scared the hell out of me. now that i'm all growed up, however, i see this movie for what it really is... a work of genius. everyone, or at least everyone with any taste, has dreamed of seeing a snowman going around killing people, even if they won't admit it. i have always found something genuinely frightening about snowmen, so naturally, for a horror junkie such as myself, thismovie was a dream come true. some people say that this movie is silly, or otherwise void of any intelligence... it's a movie about a serial killer snowman, what the hell did you expect? anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid one-liners and cheap gore. i love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the movie industry wises up and makes a serious horror flick about a killer snowman (which seems impossible, unfortunately) i will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart.
