i saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it. geoffery rush gave the best performance as a super villain that i have ever seen since gene hackman as lex luther. kel mitchel and paul rubens were a match maid in heaven. this film also introduced me to william h. macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. hank was great as the blue raja, and i especially loved that the character wasn't really british. the scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. i loved the fact that the bowler talked to the ball. some of the funniest stuff involved stiller and his character mr. furious's false rage, and the fact that his threats and one-liners were all gibberish, and that they never made any sense. i could barely stop myself from applauding when he said "fraculater, freinken-puss," was said. but one of the things i most enjoyed was that captain amazing actually dies in the movie. i highly recommend this film for any occasion, and i give it my own personal two-thumbs-up.
