this movie describes the life of somebody who grew up in the worst of circumstances but unlike many people he actually grew up to be a respectable person. whats more is that this is a true story.<br /><br />antwone fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused such just because he was not white. antwone fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and he never fooled around with women, coke, cigars, weed, alcohol, or any of those things that are very popular in the places he was growing up. <br /><br />there is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent. the only rating i can give it is a 10/10.
