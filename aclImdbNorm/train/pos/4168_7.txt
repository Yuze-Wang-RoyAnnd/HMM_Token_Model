not only does this film have one of the great movie titles, it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors ike eissenman and kim richards. i seem to remember this film being broadcast halloween week back in '78 going against linda blair in stranger in our house. i missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film. later, on repeat, i saw i made the right choice. the movie is not really bad, but, really lacks any chills or surprises. although, i did like the scene where richard crenna shoots the family dog to no avail.
