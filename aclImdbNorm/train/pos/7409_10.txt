expecting to see a "cute little film" from mainland china, i was ill-prepared. family dynamics, community and the inevitability of change have rarely been explored so expertly on film. every character is solid and i was completely drawn into the story. the organization is much more complex than american audiences will be accustomed to. yet, there is no difficulty following the progression, even while reading subtitles. jiang wu, as the retarded brother, is a constant shining light. leave your cynicism in your locker. it will be there when you check out.
