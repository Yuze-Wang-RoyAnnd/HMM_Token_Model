this is a pretty strange movie. it does comes across as an exploitation film with over-the-top violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual for being constructed around rural characters at war with each other, as opposed to an invading 'other'.<br /><br />the movie is an excessive stereotype of vietnam veterans, in a long line of films that portrayed the vets of that war as dangerous psycopaths. kris kristofferson's last line is 'i ain't lost a war yet', as he meets his demise after wreaking a long trail of murder and destruction, including the town's chief of police and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene. however, kristofferson is a good enough actor, and charismatic enough, to carry this villain with a surprising depth. vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough intensity layered over his clean cut goodness. the movie bears some plot resemblance to winchester 73 where jimmy stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until being forced to act against him.<br /><br />the movie has b-movie grade action, though the presence of kristofferson, vincent, a gorgeous victoria principal and bernadette peters give it an a-grade lineup.<br /><br />i give it a 7 for being a long lost view into an american psyche of post-vietnam/pre-reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion, and a movie industry that was willing to address such topics at that time.<br /><br />seen on the this channel, a great network that keeps playing lots of old movies of the 70s through 90s, regardless of political bent.
