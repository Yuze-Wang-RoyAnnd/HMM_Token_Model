this was an excellent film. i don't understand why so many people don't like it. there was so much in it to connect with, so many beautiful images, and so much compassion in the things that weren't said. i was thoroughly entertained, and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance, just as i am when i finish most any tom robbins story. now i haven't read this particular book of robbin's, so i don't now how this matched up, but i can't imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. the movie left a lot for you to define yourself, which is the best part of any tom robbins novel, dreaming up the details. <br /><br />to all of you who said this was the worst movie ever, i pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your hearts. far from the worst ever this movie was glorious. long live the whooping crane.
