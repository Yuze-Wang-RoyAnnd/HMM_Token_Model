actually, the answer only occupies a tiny portion of this excellent imax movie that educates us on our delicate selves. c.g. and special cameras--assisted by imax--incredibly display the inner (and outer) workings of an average human, be it adult men and women, boys and girls, or babies. nearly every human body part aspect is specifically detailed: digestion, reproduction (featuring a marvin gaye hit), the heart, etc. some especially revealing moments include how an infant can be immersed underwater and also how the brain's impulses look. it is amazing how we function.<br /><br />the subject matter skips around an awful lot. but at all times we still learn a hell of a lot about our bodies that we should be *required* to know.
