i had the privilege of watching "holly" at the edinburgh film festival last week. what a powerful and moving story! holly is a 12 yr old vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in cambodia. patrick (an american) comes into holly's life and decides he wants to help her. when holly is sold again, patrick desperately searches for her. we follow they're difficult journey through cambodia and hope for their reunion.<br /><br />holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day. the movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line. i walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can i help? this movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore.
