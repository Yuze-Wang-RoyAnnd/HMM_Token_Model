this is a great film classic from the 40's and well produced. there are very dramatic scenes in this film with john garfield,(al schmid),"force of evil",'48 and dane clark,(lee diamond),"last rites",'88, fighting the japs during wwii being completely surrounded and with only one machine-gun. when al schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury, his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend. dane clark gave an outstanding supporting role as lee diamond, who did everything to help his buddy al get his life together again. there is never a complete victory to war and lets not forget all the brave wounded military personnel in veterans hospitals from all the wars and our present iraq vets!
