despite what the title may imply, "pigs is pigs" does not star porky pig. rather, it features a young swine with an appetite more insatiable than john belushi's character in "animal house". his mother repeatedly scolds him, but it does no good. so much so that he goes to another house where a deranged scientist force-feeds him more than any mere mortal can handle (but there's a surprise at the end).<br /><br />i would mostly say that this cartoon seemed like a place holder in between the really great cartoons (daffy duck debuted three months after this came out). but make no mistake about it, they do some neat things here. the whole force-feeding sequence looks more relevant today, given the obesity epidemic overtaking our country.<br /><br />anyway, not the greatest cartoon, but worth seeing.
