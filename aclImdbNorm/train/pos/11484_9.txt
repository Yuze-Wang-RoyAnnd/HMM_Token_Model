i just came back from the montreal premiere of zero day...and i'm surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie. basically the blame is about coccio doing an easy and overplayed social message...well, mr-i'm-a-reviewer, it's an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social charge.<br /><br />not that i want to expose my life here, but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go. reject & ignorance on the menu. thing is...i understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror. high schools have became battle fields of conformity. it's a real ugly sight. you need to fight your way into being like the others. it's hard to explain, bit a lot of people dosen't realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. meanwhile, parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect.<br /><br />the real motive of the movie isn't about what is driving them. it's about this death-like calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town. cal expressed it well. it's a wake up call. drama is everywhere and it can take every shape. in that case little dramas(like andre being called a faggot for wearing a j.c penny shirt) are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town. andre & cal took the most extreme way to express their pain. the malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted.<br /><br />i like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of andre & cal, like if with the pain they communicated, cal & andre have communicated their blind rage to their community, their refusal to think about the causes of some acts. <br /><br />it might seemed aggressive as a movie, but coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating. what andre & cal are living is a reality...and a scary one that might get to other kids. <br /><br />disturbing movie...home making and strong feeling made ben coccio do a very very disturbing movie.
