the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman (writer of mirrormask) and it's really a good story. i think it would appeal to any labyrinth, princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own. and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman. i won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />the main character, tristan (tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie. the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with. he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too. three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again, and some bickering princes.<br /><br />it's a really good story. it has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. it's charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages. it's simply magical. it's a true classic fairy tale, the likes of which i haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s.
