this is a wonderful new crime series, bringing together three old stalwarts of british television (denis waterman, james bolam and alun armstrong) as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases, under the leadership of younger, career-focused amanda redman. the three quirky, irritable old cops make a brilliant team, applying twenty-year old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then - sometimes with effect, at other times to the horror of their senior officers. the three are portrayed sympathetically, warts and all. there are splendid comic scenes, and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pasts.<br /><br />at the end of the first six-part series (we are promised a further series next year) each of the characters had developed. widower james bolam cannot come to terms with his wife's untimely death. lothario denis waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather. and even obsessive alun armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and keep taking the medication! while amanda redman has to face the all-too-familiar conflict between having a life and a career. the story lines have been interesting, if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of dna-testing. but it is the interplay of four of britain's finest actors which has made the series unmissable.
