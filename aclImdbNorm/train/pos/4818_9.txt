i always have a bit of distrust before watching the british period films because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays (such as the ones of, for example, vanity fair or the other boleyn girl), but with a magnificent production design, european landscapes and those thick british accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really have.fortunately, the excellent film the young victoria does not fall on that situation, and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story, the excellent performances from emily blunt, paul bettany and jim broadbent, and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view.and i say "unexpectedly" because i usually do not pay too much attention to those details.<br /><br />"victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points in contemporary civilization, and not only on the social aspect, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural ones.but i honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much, and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so much.i also liked the way in which queen victoria is portrayed, which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but they were at least inspired by good intentions.i also found the depiction of the romance between victoria and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokes.the only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian fellowes used some clich'es of the romantic cinema on the love story, something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay.<br /><br />i liked the young victoria very much, and i really took a very nice surprise with it.i hope more period films follow the example of this movie: the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story, and not as the replacement of it.
