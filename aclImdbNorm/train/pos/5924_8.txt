woah! is one thing i can say about this movie. personally i'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie, but i loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end.<br /><br />i liked the movie, but i have to admit it was because i found brian krause who played charles brady very very irresistible, i guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie.<br /><br />there was one thing that i was disappointed over. i've watched charmed before and brian krause is married to holly marie combs, his kissing scene was o.k. in sleepwalkers, but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with holly marie combs, i don't know if it is because krause and combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more, that was the only disappointment in the movie but i guess it was made up for with brian krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the movie.<br /><br />if you are use to seeing brian krause as holly marie combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie, he was nothing like angle boy. although now that i think about it, it would be great to see krause's character on charmed taken over by evil making him something like his was in sleepwalkers.<br /><br />i also have to say the music was great in this movie too!
