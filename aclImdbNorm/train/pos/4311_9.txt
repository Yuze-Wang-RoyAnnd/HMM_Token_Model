this work is less about steve martin's character davis, than it is about kline (mack) and glover (simon), and kline and mcdonnell (claire), but the dialog inserted via davis is pondering, contemplative, near-poetic existentialism at its best. he is witty, intelligent, and thoughtful in both dialog delivery and content. the writers deserved an oscar.<br /><br />the performances are easy, relaxed, and natural; just what you would expect from "a list" actors. martin contributes the performance which leads into his more recent shopgirl, guiding you through life, love, and the pursuit of wisdom if not happiness. kline is the straight - the suit - the conformist of the film, and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing.<br /><br />this work deals with life in all aspects. it engenders a true emotional investment in its characters, and leaves you feeling hopeful that mankind is not doomed, after all, no matter what you believe, deep down.<br /><br />all in all? this is delightful, with a gritty moment or two, and easy natural dialog which draws you in, assisting its audience in gaining a high enjoyment from this work. it's definitely worth your time, though it may not be every one's top choice as friday/saturday night entertainment.<br /><br />i really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited. it's not typical, and was an unexpected surprise. another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited herein. the couples and friends hold detailed conversations, which feel and sound fully honest and (again) natural. i was very impressed with this work, and will be adding it to the dvd collection soon.<br /><br />it rates a 9.1/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
