<br /><br />if you're at all interested in pirates, pirate movies, new orleans/early 19th century american history, or yul brynner, see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it. don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews. my reaction to it was that it is entertaining, well acted (for the most part), has some very witty dialogue, and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm, appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte. while not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans' history, and the love-hate relationship between the "respectable" citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. don't worry about what the film doesn't do, but watch it for what it does do, i.e., for its study of one of new orleans', and america's, most intriguing historical figures.
