this movie was disaster at box office, and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie, sweetness of the story. music was good, story is very simple and old, but presentation of such story is very good, director tried his best. abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene. soha looks so sweet in the movie. rest star cast was simply okay. music and all songs are good, himesh is impressive as an singer here. don't miss this movie, its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us. abhay best work till date. i will give 9/10 to ahista ahista.
