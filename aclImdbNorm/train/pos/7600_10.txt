after becoming completely addicted to six feet under, i didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show. well, i was wrong! lost is spellbinding!! i absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off. the richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful setting are all amazing. i am totally and completely hooked. i don't know how the creators do it, but each character touches me very deeply. i feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my core!!! i don't have cable so i've been renting the series on netflix. when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over. i can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house. this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen!!!
