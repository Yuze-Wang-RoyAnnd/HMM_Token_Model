this is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that warner bros could afford. ...and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s, an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties' exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance. the show of shows is pretty gigantic. vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan-dance after ukulele lunacy after rin tin tin who introduces 'an oriental number'...(!)... and on and on it lumbers, grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality vitaphone sound. it is far too long, but among it's delirious delights are the awesome "singin in the bathtub" number created on a scale of which the qe2 architects would be proud...beatrice lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty, nick lucas, and the never-ending grand finale in two color color...which is all set to the song lady luck. . so keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en-ter-tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort. row after row of "doll" characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor. i kid you not, there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers, mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes, unable to move (for days, i imagine, during production) whilst this katzenjammer of toy-box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the ukulele orchestra. of course i loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions. and so should you...and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill. it is all so demented.
