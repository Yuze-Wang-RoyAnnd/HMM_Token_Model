when i was over at hollywood video i looked through their clearance out movies and there was demonicus for five buckaroos plus fifty percent off! i saw it only once before and couldn't pass up this great deal! the second viewing was much better than the first. the box is so cool and the music is very good. if you haven't seen demonicus yet i recommend that you do or if you rented and hated demonicus do give it another chance as another viewing of it may change your mind. if you seen a copy at hollywood video for the price i got it for don't pass it up as it is a great deal!<br /><br />demonicus is well a very different but entertaining movie.believe it or not is like watching a interactive video game with out playing it!it has very low budget and actors i'm sure that nobody is familiar with. we began the the video game uh i mean film with a guy and a woman some where in italy and there is a cave that actually looks like a rail road/train track tunnel and she says don't go in there and what does he do?the normal stuff!he didn't listen to her! he goes in there and find lots of gladiator artifacts and armor and a almost perfectly preserved body of a legendary gladiator named tyrannous!where did the chair come from that tyrannous was sitting on and how did his body stay so good and where did the cauldron pot come from?so every cave is complete with a caultron pot?tyrannous is wearing his armor,helmet,and has a weapon or two.he does the dumbest thing a person could do,he puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of tyrannous! from there he walks around just killing all of the campers near by to bring back the real tyrannous.<br /><br />now,i said before its like a video game.its hard to explain but it just feels like it.the music even sounds like video games.the acting is really terrible.the actors say things like why is he doing this,oh he was nuts already and fine since he's nuts i'm going home!also the movie also has some major errors like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a break!<br /><br />this movie has some errors but it isn't a classic like werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movies then you better see demonicus!
