after seeing arthur on tv numerous times i laughed so hard dudley moore's role as arthur a happy go luck drunken millionaire was hysterical but john gielgud as his servant/ father figure hobson was equally charming. i bought the dvd a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the passage of nearly 27 years it's still as enjoyable as it ever was liza minnelli's role as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic.<br /><br />arthur bach, (moore) is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like the national debt he has no desire to grow up and enjoys acting like a child. his activities are supervised by his dry english butler hobson (gielgud) it appears that nobody really cares about arthur except for him, arthur's father (barbour) offers an ultimatum if he doesn't marry the dreadful blonde socialite susan johnson (eikenberry) in four weeks he'll cut off his son's inheritance of 750 million dollars.<br /><br />however arthur meets and falls in love with linda marolla (minnelli)a young working class waitress and tie thief,now he faces a difficult decision marry for love or money. when hobson dies arthur finally grows up and breaks it off with susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep both the money and his true love.<br /><br />arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for for everyone
