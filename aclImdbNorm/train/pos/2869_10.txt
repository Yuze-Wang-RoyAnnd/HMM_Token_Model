first off, i want to say, "thanks, disney, for finally releasing the "cinderella" movie on dvd! now you have all the disney animated films on dvd (including the 1999 limited editions)! what are you going to do next? you're going to disney world!!!!!" well, technically (i mean, look at the castle!!!!!)<br /><br />anyways, disney remains magical in his 1950 animated classic film "cinderella," the movie that put fairy tale movies on the map. we are all familiar with the story of cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just for saying "bippity- boppity-boo!," and of course, trying to head home by midnight!<br /><br />what i like about this film: it's a grand old fairy tale that children like, now in a movie form (as well as on dvd as well)!!!!!<br /><br />"cinderella" - thank you, disney!!!!! 10 stars.
