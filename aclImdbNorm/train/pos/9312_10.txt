i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. i like raptors because they are scary. my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana.<br /><br />i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it's got a good ending even though i didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that's the important part. the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first time.<br /><br />this is best movie.
