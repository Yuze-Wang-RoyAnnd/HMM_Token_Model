if you haven't seen this obscure little charmer, you should seek it out. it is the story of a bumbling, wartime sad sack (fred macmurray) who is listed 4-f each time he attempts to join any branch of the military. he finds a magic lamp which of course contains a genie (gene sheldon), but the genie is even more bumbling than macmurray is, sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants. it is cute, cheerful, and pure fluff, and you can't help but like it. the plots is much like a disney film, particularly since the two stars (macmurray and sheldon) both made numerous disney films in the 50's and 60's, although not together. needless to say, it all ends well for everyone, and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good.
