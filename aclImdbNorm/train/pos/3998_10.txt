i somehow missed this movie when it came out and have discovered it as late as last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. i can honestly say that i cannot remember another intimate dramatic film, which does so many things so well. the writing is crisp, realistic, nuanced, and even restrained. the cinematography and editing are understated but inspired, enabling the visual storytelling to dominate through marvelous close-ups and framing of images, capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways. the acting is also wonderful, with all of the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling ways that a film can offer. they reveal their innermost weaknesses with unprotected, raw vulnerability. a real triumph for roger michell and hanif kureishi, and the rest of the team. a must see for serious film lovers.
