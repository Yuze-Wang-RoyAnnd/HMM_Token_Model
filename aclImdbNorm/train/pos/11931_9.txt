this was a top-notch movie with a top-notch cast. danny glover, tony danza, joseph gordon-levitt, and especially christopher lloyed are well-cast in this charming movie about real-life angels helping the angels baseball team. you never know, it could happen. i loved lloyd's role in it. he was hilarious. the story is about turning your life around, as the kid's belief in angels helped turn around angry, hardened, and embittered manager glover see the best in people. the movie was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams. it was funny, charming, touching, and sad, all very nicely done. you will like (or love) it. i guarantee.<br /><br />*** out of ****
