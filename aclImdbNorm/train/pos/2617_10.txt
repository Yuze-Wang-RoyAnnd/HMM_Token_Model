i watched lion king more times that all my friends put togther. having a baby sister.. you know how it is. by now i memorized both the plot and the lines. after lion king 2 came out i was like ok well let me see... the second one was significantly weaker... then i saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1/2... i was like ok there we go again. after watching the 1 1/2 i was like wow. all my expectations (for repetitevness) were broken. a truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time. i have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that roflmao will apply here 100%.<br /><br />i definetly recommend seeing the cartoon.
