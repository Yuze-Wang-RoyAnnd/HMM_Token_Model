"i have looked into the eye of this island, and what i saw was beautiful," proclaims one of the main characters in abc's award winning television show "lost". the series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island, but that would be doing the show a disservice. "lost" follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island, each other, and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other. the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island, either - and that they may not be alone.<br /><br />my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period, but this proved to be unfounded. the narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the execution is superb. the island is a character all on its own, and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself, which only goes to show its originality and greatness.<br /><br />at the time of writing this review, only the first two seasons have aired, and they're filled with strong episodes. my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway, but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes.<br /><br />if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now, it would certainly be this one. if you like excitement, adventure, character driven stories, an extremely strong cast and crew, beautiful locations, and an island that seems more spiritual than natural, "lost" is for you. just be sure you start at the beginning.
