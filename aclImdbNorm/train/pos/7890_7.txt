freddy's dead: the final nightmare (1991) was the last film to feature freddy krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or a co-star). the years of killing have taken a toll upon the town of springwood. it has gotten to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town. the parents who killed freddy krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price. only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere. but that doesn't stop freddy from seeking out his final revenge. no matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. but this time he finds out a little more about his old life. can the kids finally stop freddy for good? what is this secret that is buried in freddy's twisted mind? to find out you'll have to watch freddy's dead. the end was originally filmed in 3-d.<br /><br />a fitting way to end the franchise. freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang! lisa zane, yaphet kotto and freddy krueger star in this final installment. rosanne, tom arnold and johnny depp make special appearances. a whole lot better than the last one but it's filled with a few dated jokes. if you enjoy the series then you don't want to miss out on this one.<br /><br />i have to recommend this movie for freddy fans.
