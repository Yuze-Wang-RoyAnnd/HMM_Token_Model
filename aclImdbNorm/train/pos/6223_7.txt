from a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older films. it's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. especially such a shallow and inconstant man. he's obviously a player (i wouldn't trust him to stay true to her) who doesn't want to settle down, who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them "baby" (ick!). even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him, he only goes to her after he's (supposedly) rejected by another woman and learns that connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him. i wanted her to stand up to him, not pathetically chase after him! his sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me.<br /><br />apart from that subplot, i did like the movie. how can you not like sailors dancing with each other?! (you can tell they were from san francisco.... ;d) the "rehearsal" dance was great, watching ginger rogers purposefully fall in and out of the "correct steps" was great. the last dance scene "face the music" with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful. and i really enjoyed "we saw the sea" (though they did use it a few too many times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /><br />anyway, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (imo) - and the songs were ok, but the dancing was worth watching the film for. i wish they could have showed some shots of san francisco since that was were the film was supposedly set.<br /><br />it's also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what hitler was already doing at that time. i have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land.
