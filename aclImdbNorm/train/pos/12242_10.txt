i consider this movie a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a great movie it was. first, it describes a face of ww2 that we don't usually see in hollywood movies. in particular, german soldiers, army and the nazi government are shown more "humanized". one of the facts that impressed me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of berlin alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where reinhold kills mieze. another clue for those who like the details, is the representation of doors. fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed. and the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. have you noticed that?
