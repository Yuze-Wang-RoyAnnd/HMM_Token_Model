oh, where are you going, my little one, little one...<br /><br />turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four...<br /><br />i remember these shows when they were first broadcast on disneyland. i remember sitting there, electrified by werner van braune's explanations of rocket science. i watched as history, science and humor were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilities.<br /><br />that was fifty years ago. and the shows are back in the disney treasures series, and what a treasure they are. i watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter, who at first would not even come in the room, but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated. as she watched i watched her, and by the end she was nearly as engrossed as i had been.<br /><br />turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own...<br /><br />sure, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. but there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate, and the overall presentation is still impressive. i found myself thinking my daughter's teacher might want to show them to her class, not only as a 50 year old artifact, but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history.<br /><br />turn around, turn around, turn around and again...you're wondering how much has really changed in 50 years.
