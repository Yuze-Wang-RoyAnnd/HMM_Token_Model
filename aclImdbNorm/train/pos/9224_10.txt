this movie is visually stunning. who cares if she can act or not. each scene is a work of art composed and captured by john derek. the locations, set designs, and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty, youth and wealth. in some ways i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo derek's story. and...this commentary would not be complete without mentioning anthony quinn's role as father, mentor, lover, and his portrayal of a man, of men, lost to a bygone era when men were men. there are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence, containment, and security. yes, they do not make men like that anymore! but, then how often do you find women who are made like bo derek.
