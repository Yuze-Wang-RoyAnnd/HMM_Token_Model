the story for hare rama hare krishna actually came to dev anand's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous prem pujari in calcutta. he was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt prem pujari's posters. but the life of hippies re ignited a story in dev's mind to be made into a film.<br /><br />this was dev anand's perhaps best directorial effort. the film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and zeenat aman as dev's sister made a tremendous impact.<br /><br />this film was dev anand's call to the nation to keep up their moral values.<br /><br />it is about a montereal based indian family and the brother's role is a very affectionate one for his sister. but the parents quarrel and separate leaving prashant(dev) with mother and jasbir(zeenat) with father. she is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see prashant again.<br /><br />she is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home. dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that jasbir is in kathmandu with certain hippies.<br /><br />to reunite with his sister, dev travels to kathmandu and meets shanti(mumtaz) who was to later marry him and also janice who in reality is jasbir with a new name and new identity. she has forgotten her childhood and dev too.<br /><br />dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in kathmandu and the people are after his life.<br /><br />this was a story well directed and acted-both by dev anand. we see more of zeenat aman than of mumtaz. but the music by rahul dev burman was well composed. dev had first offered the music to be composed by sachin dev burman but burman da did not want dev to do the film. he was very close to dev and his earlier film prem pujari, though was good, but had been opposed in calcutta. burman da wanted dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people's anger against dev. but dev continued with the film reassuring burman da and the film was indeed a success.<br /><br />r d burman had asha bhosle sing the award winning dum maro dum. kanchi re kanchi re was another good number.<br /><br />overall it is a good film.
