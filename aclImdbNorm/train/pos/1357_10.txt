wow what an episode! after last week seeing mellisa constantly making cameos about the friendship of annie and brandi i almost puked. but that was nothing until seeing mellisa's tirade after being fired. seeing her hobble around on her cast spewing out obscenities and screaming for someone to get her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever on reality tv. she continued to scream at people off set to get her clothes "all of them" like someone else would wear one of her hideous outfits. mellisa you are like 40 years old and you still throw temper tantrums? then joan starts calling annie and brandie every name in the book, and gets up and quits the show! both rivers are spoiled brats who were only left on the show this long to keep ratings up. mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview, just proves to america what everyone thought, you are a spoiled baby. wah wah i can't get my way! i love how annie told the cameras she could manipulate mellisa to think her way, and then did exactly that. mellisa is by far the smartest contestant and clearly deserves to win the whole game.
