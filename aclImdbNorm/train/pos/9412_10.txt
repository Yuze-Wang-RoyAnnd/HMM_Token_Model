when i saw this film in the 1950s, i wanted to be a scientist too. there was something magical and useful in science. i took a girl - friend along to see it a second time. i don't think she was as impressed as i was! this film was comical yet serious, at a time when synthetic fibres were rather new. lessons from this film could be applied to issues relating to gm experimentation of today.
