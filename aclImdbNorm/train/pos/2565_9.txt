i really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between american servicemen and japanese women in post-war japan--as well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them. brando goes from having contempt for the japanese (which is natural considering ww2) to falling in love with a japanese woman and wanting to marry her. his performance is okay (i am not a major fan of his acting style) and the movie is marvelous throughout. red buttons received an oscar for his touching performance of another gi who falls in love in japan (though the japanese women who plays opposite him also did a remarkable job).<br /><br />i don't want to spoil it but the movie is a good one to watch with a box of tissues.<br /><br />this movie manages to say something and be entertaining at the same time. a mostly underrated gem.
