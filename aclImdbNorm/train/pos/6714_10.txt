why did i enjoy the show to the last episode? because of the true talent melissa joan hart and her supporting cast had of demonstrating that whit, comedy, light-hearted humor, and deep thought could actually coexist. what i enjoyed most was the fact that i could come home from a hard day's work, and bust a smile... i was inspired... and why? it was an inspiration to watch as this magical person was so happy while helping others. <br /><br />sabrina was a hero in my opinion... even though she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from our own... to very different; she had powers at her fingertip, wishes, and command that could be used for good or bad which may only exist in many of our imaginations. most everything we see, have, know about, own, or even desire... can be used for good or bad, and how we choose to define that, defines the person we are. <br /><br />she traveled the globe and other realms with these constant and unwaivering ideas in mind... to learn, to live, to laugh, and to love. she was always learning how to improve her skills to the benefit of all around her; she made mistakes as she was living life, going through different journey's of growth, as she, her aunts, and salem (the underrated, yet imperfect hero) did well to demonstrate that even through mistakes, you can still be noble, gifted, and wonderful. <br /><br />she also demonstrated many selfless, learning, and loving acts as she went along her way. if this isn't reason enough for 10 stars in this war torn world where people are so hostile toward each other, not realizing how differences are the spice of life rather than a reason to kill... then i don't know what is. this show was most certainly a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift intended to bust a smile on our chops... i've heard from a doctor before that everything that i've mentioned above leads to a healthy "hart"... and isn't that what we all need? :)
