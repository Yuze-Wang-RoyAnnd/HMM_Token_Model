i am actually outraged at the comment i read stating that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful scenery was marred by the black and white footage. it was made in 1925!!!! i think it absolutely incredible for it's time! <br /><br />the journey that these people had to go through is utterly remarkable. it took them a week just to cross a river. the women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs climbing up a solid sheet of rock, sometimes barefoot in the snow. i would like to see anybody do that now! <br /><br />i thought it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story.
