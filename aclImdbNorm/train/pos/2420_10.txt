if you enjoy the subtle (yes, i said subtle) actions and reactions of john candy, you can't help but like this film (pronounced "fillum" by salvatore dipasquale). the unobservant (and uninformed) watcher always saw candy as a broad actor - a big buffoon. and sometimes he was (see "stripes" and "splash"). but, when given the opportunity, he could really be razor-sharp and quite subtle. it's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side, because we'll never get to see more of the other. oh, yeah, the movie. one can watch "going berserk" over and over (i know i have) with the frequency of "caddyshack." it's just that good. the plot, although a little convoluted, is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind. it allows candy and the always under-rated joe flaherty and eugene levy to bounce off of candy...and they bounce hard. definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed sctv or candy's other work.
