this has the funnist jokes out of all the cheech & chong flicks. it's the first one i saw with these guys. i found it to be really good. my dad actually recommended me to get it. what a great role model, and my grandma actually bought it for me, knowing what it was like. what a family i have. well this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic. i must warn you though, this isn't gut-busting funny. it has its moments but not as funny as there's something about mary. check it out anyway. i'm sure you'll laugh. unless your an anti-drug activist or something.
