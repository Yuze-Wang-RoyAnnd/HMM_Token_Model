deeply emotional. it can't leave you neutral.<br /><br />yes it's a love story between 2 18 years old boys. but it's only the body of this movie. and it's been removed. you only feel what happened with these boys. you feel the soul of the movie. with of course some action, some sex, but this is no pornography, too many feelings.<br /><br />it was only a summer "story", and it became, from love to hate, almost to death, the most important time of their lives. i loved it, you will too, whatever your feelings are.
