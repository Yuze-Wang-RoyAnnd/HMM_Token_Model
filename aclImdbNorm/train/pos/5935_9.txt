after seeing the terrible, terrible, terrible batman: dead end i knew i had to see this as soon as i heard about it.<br /><br />pressing play to view the trailer i thought i was in for another hideous short from what so-far looked like another bad wannabe film-maker trying to bring new depth to an existing character. but was instead greeted with a greatly put together trailer for a movie that sadly doesn't exist, as i would love to see a finished movie even if it was only 30 minutes long.<br /><br />world's finest makes up for batman: dead end and then some.<br /><br />i look forward to the next short!
