i, too, loved this series when i was a kid. in 1952 i was 5 and my family always watched this show. my favorite character was the one played by marion lorne as a rather stuttering, bumbling and very lovable "aunt" type person. i can still recall her "ubba bubba um um" type comments as she would try and say something important. and then when she came back and played aunt clara in bewitched it was great casting! <br /><br />it was the first time that i can remember seeing walter matthau whose career i followed as a fan for many many years.<br /><br />i have a question if anyone can verify: was the title or end credits music the "swedish rhapsody" by hugo alfven? every time i hear it played on my classical radio station here in southern california it brings back memories of the image of mr. peepers walking away with his back to the camera. i'm not even certain if this image in my mind's eye is correct.
