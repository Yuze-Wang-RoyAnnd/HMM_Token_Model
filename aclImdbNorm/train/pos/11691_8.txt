great movie when i saw it. have to say one of my favorite movies of all time. i saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the dvd. as i got older and saw it again i realized that the movie is average. compared to movies that are known ad good comedys, this is nothing. i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great. also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking. it's like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch. i like the movie overall so i give it a...<br /><br />still a good 7/10 for me.
