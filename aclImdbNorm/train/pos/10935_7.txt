well, i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie. despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy, and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, i was not disappointed. the story was actually pretty interesting: the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil, and who is using them for good. the catch being that during training, all of the clan were masked, and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names.<br /><br />the fights are a joy to watch, as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard, and centipede. the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place, and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action.<br /><br />the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence. but stick with it, and you won't be disappointed!
