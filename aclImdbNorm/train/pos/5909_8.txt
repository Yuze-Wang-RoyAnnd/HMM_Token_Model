i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie....except when the bras and bullets started flying. i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyone....but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep. i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics. also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat. if i'm correct ralph bashki did that movie too.it involves a cat that goes through hard times with family, streets,jobs , etc. when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out. because coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter. ralph bashki also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt. heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.
