all of the people reviewing this film, and probably many professional film reviewers, just don't get it. this film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great czech filmmaker, karel zeman. if you want to know what i'm talking about, i suggest you get any of zeman's films, such as the fabulous world of jules verne, baron munchausen, journey to the beginning of time, or on the comet. if you are unable to locate a film, then read the reviews in amg. they will explain the processes used. if one were to look at zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci/fi fantasy films of the time, viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either. it is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day, because both zemen and hines "do not compute". they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only. if you look at this film from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. it isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. i thought that the creatures were also quite good, also considering how they were made. hines took a great gamble, and i think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come. someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing, rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual cg work. regarding the actors, i think hines also took a page from zemen's book, in that many of zemen's actors were somewhat expressionless at first, but became much more engaging as the film and action went on. it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library. i will watch it for years to come, all three great hours of it.
