i have to be honest and say i bought this movie, not because of the content, but because david cubitt is in it; i know ... shallow, or what? - but, come on, mr cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it mildly.<br /><br />i really didn't know what to expect from watching this movie, i'd read the other write up, and those on other sites but i have to say i was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go. david cubitt as theo, and colm feore as ryan are so believable as the two estranged brothers, the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death. the scene where theo finds out ryan is gay was played brilliantly, he literally walks in on a scene and tries to leave without ryan noticing - which of course he has.<br /><br />the film has been very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad, moving, uplifting and a celebration of life in parts. i came away from this feeling sad at what ryan went through but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and unconditional love by the ex drug addict brother theo. i agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where theo says he will be a father moving, and i'd go a little further to say i actually vocalised my thoughts at ryan when he cruelly says to theo 'what makes you think you can be a father' and theo says simply 'you.' theo walks away then, but that small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self pitying aspect of ryan who is brought up sharply by the simple retort.<br /><br />a brilliantly conceived movie on all counts, the acting, directing, writing etc are all so well done. i can't really find anything else to say about this movie, except to say that it is very hard dealing with the death of a loved one but this is done superbly, to the infinite degree. the respect for the subject matter and the outpouring of love (without being contrite and mawkish) speaks volumes in this rather selfish world we live in today. well done to all concerned.<br /><br />not many movies bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general, and also to be glad for all the things i have and not be sad for the things i don't, but this movie did, it was unbelievably uplifting considering the subject matter.
