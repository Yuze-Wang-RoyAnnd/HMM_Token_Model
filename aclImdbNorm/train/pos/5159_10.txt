this is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of trek. there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool. first the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode. they meet a freaky librarian type dude (very well played). then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like 16th century earth. mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen, awful world by some bad guy.<br /><br />spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal assestment whuppin' when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out. anyhow,they all finally escape, leaving the poor cavegirl behind. it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves. you can literally taste the sadness at the end. leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching. spock must have been out of his vulkin' mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human. albeit, in a not so nice neighborhood!<br /><br />anyway, you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode....a love story, the salem witch trials, spock as a human, the desperation of being left in total isolation...abandoned, and three entirely different settings on the alien planet. its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film. this one is a classic, don't miss it....i want it on dvd fer shure vulcans!!!!!!
