i love cinema so what i'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply. i had given a thumbs down to "che, parts 1 and 2" without having seen the film. terrible i know. but i felt into a trap perpetrated by...who? i don't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and, no matter how smart i think i am, i fell into it. but, thankfully, i bumped into an argeninean film director, martin donovan, a man i love and admire. when i told him i wasn't going to see it because i knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and donovan is a pacifist! he took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why. i went to see both parts straight away and, "che, part 1 and 2" is the best film i've seen in 2008. it is, of such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. the regard for its audience is something that we're not used to anymore. i don't know if we ever were. riveting, moving, without concessions and benicio del toro is just extraordinary. we can see his soul, we can actually perceive it. the humanity of the man is overwhelming. so, thank you martin donovan once again for educating me so honestly. bravo del toro, bravo soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark film. don't commit the mistake i was about to commit. go see it, now, on the big screen
