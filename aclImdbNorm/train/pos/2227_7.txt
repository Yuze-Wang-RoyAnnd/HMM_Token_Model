this one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't comfortably fit any mold. it's horror-- but not a splatterfest. it's equal part suspense as well as horror-- yet without the usual hollywood screams and jerky camera. <br /><br />the feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because i think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters.<br /><br />forget that brendan is a graduate of the buffy universe. that's a red herring. he is acting here. 'camp' is a misreading of the tone of this story. adrienne barbeau is giving a rock solid performance-- so she must believe the script has something to say. we all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly don't care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap "cut" and get their paychecks. this is not the case, here.<br /><br />forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo-funny regularity. i don't think the intent was humorous-- but to keep you off balance. <br /><br />think of it less of a horror 'movie' and more of a horror 'play' on a stage-- that decrepit whitewashed house. then you might see it's really about paranoia, fear, and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace, usa.<br /><br />and it is twisty. time travel, mind control, secret experiments and nazi's who may not be dead. . .yet.<br /><br />i say rent it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral. this would be a good choice for a saturday midnight sit down.
