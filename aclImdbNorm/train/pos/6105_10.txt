all kira reed fans must see this. the film's premise has struggling romance novelist kira unable to come up with any new ideas. she's also getting over a divorce. however, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). they go into a corner room and they do it. thankfully, kira gets a condom out (now don't ever tell me these playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. remember kids, safe sex). later, she marvels to her publishist how great it was, but she didn't get his name. despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. but eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. when she does, all hell breaks loose, and i'll leave it at that. this is easily the best of these soft-core playboys films i've seen. check this out, and marvel at the greatness of kira.
