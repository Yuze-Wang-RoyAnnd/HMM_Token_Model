sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment. most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip. the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments. the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives. this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured. later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne. the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish. jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.
