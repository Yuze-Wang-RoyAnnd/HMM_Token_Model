a solid, if unremarkable film. matthau, as einstein, was wonderful. my favorite part, and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again, was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton, i loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for robbins to retrieve the birdie.
