jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy, but hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. as a portrayal of a new york character, only daniel day lewis' portrayal of bill butcher in gangs of new york comes to mind as comparable, and day doesn't give his character the emotional depth that hoffman gives ratso. <br /><br />it's typical of hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight. i think hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels. <br /><br />voight's buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.<br /><br />midnight cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. i think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a loser you might be (ratso clearly defines "loser"), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else. <br /><br />i can't help but compare midnight cowboy to klute, from a few years later, which i think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape.
