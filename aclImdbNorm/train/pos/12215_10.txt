i loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. i found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very engaging.<br /><br />what i found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring -- and thus challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. the idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. without preaching, and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities, and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. i look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.
