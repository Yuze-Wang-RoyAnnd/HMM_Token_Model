cinderella is one of disney's greatest films, one of those films i think you appreciate more the older you get. disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale. i consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release. the characters became more dimensional than earlier films, creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters disney ever created. with her kindness and dash of dry humor, she is extremely likeable; however, it is the inspiration she provides which makes her memorable. like many people she is an endless dreamer, and she holds onto her dreams, never giving up. even in the most adverse of situations, her dreams endure, and she won't let anyone take that away from her. her example should serve as inspiration to everyone, and encouragement to never let go of your dreams.
