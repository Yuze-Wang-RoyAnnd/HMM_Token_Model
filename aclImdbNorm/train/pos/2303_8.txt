the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950's. the main story follows a 14-year old girl (reese witherspoon) who develops a crush on a 17-year old neighbor (jason london) who ends up falling for her older sister (emily warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family's dynamics forever. the 1950's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately. witherspoon already begins to show the oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man. warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well. kudos to sam waterston and tess harper who play the girls' parents and gail strickland, who plays london's mom. i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase "family ties."
