this is what i wrote to some friends earlier:<br /><br />holy crap, the grudge is, honest to god, one of the scariest films i've ever seen! i am either getting very soft in my old age, or sam raimi and ghost pictures did a kick a** job! (can't wait for boogeyman!)<br /><br />i was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished i had someone, anyone, sitting next to me (except the protagonist in grudge. i saw the movie by myself.) i swear, there were many many jump scenes that were not expected! i felt foolish but my nerves did not care! i was on edge the entire movie, from the opening credits, and the music was fantastically scary. i keep thinking of that sound, though, and i do not like it!<br /><br />i actually gasped aloud a few times, and cried, "oh" at one scene!! oh, yeah, i even half-covered my eyes a few times! word to the wise, though: i thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic. my dh hated event horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and psycho, but i don't remember the movie so can't compare.<br /><br />i can't say i "enjoyed" this movie b/c i was terrified, but it was very very good and scary. the ending scene, too...whoa! for being a 32-year-old-mommy, i think i may have nightmares from this movie, especially because of that sound. please get out of my head ;)<br /><br />in summary, this is not a slasher flick like i grew up with (jason, freddy). this is a most-of-the-time spooky movie. perfect for halloween.<br /><br />two great trailers for this movie were boogeyman and the ring 2!!
