i just saw this movie on hbo, and it was really good...a tragic love story indeed! i really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident. it's rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically handicapped. the love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life nicely portrayed how i'd like to think love can heal someone's heart. laura leighton...all of 27 when she made this movie...was great as the woman so full of life she's able to revive this guy's heart. unfortunately, since his family is wealthy and her's is not, "problems" develop.<br /><br />it's playing on hbo some more times this month. check out the schedule here - http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ scheduleservlet?action_detail=detail&focus_id=598947
