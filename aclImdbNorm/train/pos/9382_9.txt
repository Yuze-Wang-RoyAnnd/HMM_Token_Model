red rock west is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore. it's well paced, well acted and doesn't leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre.<br /><br />nicolas cage stars as michael, an unemployed texas roughneck, desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to wyoming for potential employment. he is honest to a fault, but always on the dark side of fate.<br /><br />after failing to obtain gainful employment, michael stumbles into the red rock bar where the owner wayne (j.t.walsh) mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from dallas, hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle).<br /><br />wayne gives michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous suzie. with no intent on following through, michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn suzanne of her impending demise. he also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits.<br /><br />as fate would dictate, michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy. while leaving in a violent rainstorm, he runs down suzannes lover. of course michael being michael, he takes him to the local hospital where it's discovered that he's also been shot.<br /><br />the sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it, wayne is also the local law. michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real "lyle from dallas" played with murderous glee by the quirky dennis hopper. after discovering that they're fellow marines, lyle insists that michael join him for a drink at, where else, the red rock bar. there wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and lyle are in hot pursuit of michael who falls willingly into suzannes waiting arms.<br /><br />as the pace picks up we learn that wayne and suzanne are really wanted armed robbers, on the lam for a multi million dollar theft. getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals, double crosses and murders.<br /><br />the film was very well cast. nicolas cage was typically low key, dennis hopper and lara flynn bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability. the best performance was by the late j.t. walsh who was menacing without appearing to be. walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon.<br /><br />marc reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development. the film was further enhanced by john dahl's tight directorial style and morris chestnut's rapid fire editing.
