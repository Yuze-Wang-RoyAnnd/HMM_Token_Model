typical 90's comedy, situational comedy similar to our modern day "my family". thatcher being the height of most political jokes, bill (belinda lang) blames thatcher for anything she can. "bloody thatcher" possibly shared with most of us. david the typical teenager, cutting up brains with bread knives, jenny, the moody older teenage child, only interested in boys and more boys. bill and ben working as much as they can to keep their family afloat struggling within the economical climate of the early 90's. granted the first two series were not as successful as the latter however, series 3 onwards is where it all kicks off with more laughs that i care to count. overall this show didn't get the best viewing times and they ought to have held on a bit longer. clearly they couldn't have carried on after gary olsen died but i think they should get rid of "catherine tate" "the office" "little britain" and bring back the classics!
