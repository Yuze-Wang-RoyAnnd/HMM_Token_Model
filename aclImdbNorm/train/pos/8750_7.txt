brokedown palace is the story of two best friends, alice and darlene, who go on a spontaneous trip to thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage. in this way, the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film, such as "return to paradise", but instead, the movie chose to focus little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship.<br /><br />claire danes and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performances, and the movie is much more about the interplay between them - the suspicion, the jealousy, the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. this movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life (which is a bit glossed over), and focuses more on these friendship issues.<br /><br />there were some plot holes here, and some parts that just didn't seem believable or realistic. we didn't feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have. and we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls, with bill pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold. in short, this should, by all rights, have been a much darker movie than it was.<br /><br />but overall, i enjoyed it. the acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting. worth seeing.
