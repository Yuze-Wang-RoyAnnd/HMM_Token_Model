love trap is a "must see" independent film. when i sat down to watch the movie, i came in with low expectations, but left with a blessing. the story is poetic, substantive, and creative. the writer pulls you in further and further which each scene, allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that every one can identify with. the movie allowed me to reflect on my life and what i consider love to be. the movie displayed what love really is, action not emotion. i was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie. the entire presentation surpassed my expectations. i give the movie two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds.
