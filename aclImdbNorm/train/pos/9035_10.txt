the acting in this movie was superb. as an amateur rocketeer, i found very few mistakes. as a human being, it touched my heart and soul. to watch the actors, you would think that they are the actual characters. laura dern, a favorite actress of mine, left nothing out of her performance. the young actors playing the rocket boys showed talent beyond their years, especially young homer. homer's father inspired that eternal love/hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real. if you don't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms, then get your pulse checked (you may be dead).
