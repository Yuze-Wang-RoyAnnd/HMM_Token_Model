at the time i recall being quite startled and amused by this movie. i referred to it as the most important movie i'd seen in ten years, and found myself bumping into people who said similar things. <br /><br />bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook. and she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had, into a corrosive, adult world-view. the two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers. (hi skip. i wish you weren't my brother so i could **** you!) <br /><br />bernhards search for herself after returning to la from new york, results in the immersive trying-on of various personas (all of which fit poorly) for our amusement, but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a "black imperative" values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her. (it's been a while. nina simone comes to mind. and she has an impressive, solidly-built black lover in the movie) a pretty black girl attends the shows, and seems to be authorizing sandra's faux-blackness, but ultimately rejects her.<br /><br />just as catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for christ, here sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place; as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection. it's the only value system implicated in the films world, outside of bernhards arty confusion.<br /><br />for a nation whose chief issues are racism and money, it's refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way.
