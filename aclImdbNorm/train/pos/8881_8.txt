first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in. 1995. rappers were in it, and that added to the flair of it.<br /><br />remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't, until he met and was befriended by nazis. they took him in. nazi's aren't all this awkward, but like most gangs, they fill a void that is missing be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. michael rappaport played the part perfectly.<br /><br />omar epps was the hot shot track star, with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight, and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it.<br /><br />kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in, until she was date raped. she then found her self experiment with her sexuality, and getting involved politically.<br /><br />this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism, people's own perspectives come into play.<br /><br />i read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one (nazis). so what? remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all, he was trying to find his way, and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him. he was scared, it was sad to see him devolve how he did. he even says right before he kills himself, i didn't mean it, i wanted to be an engineer.<br /><br />ice cube and busta rhymes were angry black men, ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual, and busta rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug. they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates, and generally appear to not like white people very much. they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness. sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the nazis? no.<br /><br />people say it shows white=-bad black=good. not true, the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even remy was a good guy, he was just misguided.<br /><br />omar epps, ice cube and busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and inconsiderate. although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger. remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well.<br /><br />good movie, well done. like all movies that deal with racism, its a great piece to get a discussion going.<br /><br />i don't think cube and busta coulda beat those nazis though.
