the snobs and pseudo experts consider it "a far cry from de sica's best" the ones suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting to this masterpiece. de sica spoke in a very direct way. his italianness doesn't have the convoluted self examination of modern italian filmmakers, or the bitter self parody of pietro germi, the pungent bittersweetness of mario monicelli, the solemnity of visconti or the cold observation of antonioni. de sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children's bed before they went to sleep. there is no attempt to intellectualize. miracolo a milano and in a lesser degree il giudizio universale are realistic fairy tales, or what today we call magic realism. the film is a gem from beginning to end and toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that, naturally, requires for you to have a heart. cinema in its purest form. magnificent.
