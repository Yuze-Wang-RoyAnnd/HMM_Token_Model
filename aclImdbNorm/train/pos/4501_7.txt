this group of english pros are a pleasure to watch. the supporting cast could form a series of their own. it's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. only the superior acting skills of francesca annis, michael kitchen, and the sexy robson greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable "romp". the only quibble is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering francesca annis would fall in love and actually marry michael kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a british sex symbol. you can readily understand why robson green would light her fire, with apologies to the "doors". the guy who almost steals the show with a great "laid back" performance is owen's father david bradley. watch him in "the way we live now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. daniela nardini as kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body. conor mullen, and julian rhind-tutt, as green's sidekick surgery buddies as i've said could have their own series. they are that good. the whole thing is a great deal of fun, and i heartily recommend it, and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue.
