the choice to make this snl skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones. the humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor, and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two.<br /><br />oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided, but that may have been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it. i suppose i was thinking more "leisure suit larry" risqu'e than the producers were...<br /><br />definitely not a pg-13 movie, which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors, but still better premise and writing than its more dismal ones.<br /><br />i liked it, but i doubt it will be a smash hit... (which is sad, as tim meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other snl alumni tend to)
