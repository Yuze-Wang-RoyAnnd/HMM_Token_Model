the fourth man (paul verhoeven - netherlands 1983).<br /><br />a film based on a novella by gerard reve, that works best as a thriller. that's quite surprising, considering reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.<br /><br />"the fourth man" is top-heavy on symbolism. paul verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and i'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. he usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. in "the fourth man" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. there's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise good story. <br /><br />nevertheless, when you can cope with verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach, it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round, thom hoffman and jeroen krabb'e in particular.<br /><br />camera obscura --- 7/10
