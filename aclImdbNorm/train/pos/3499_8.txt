raising victor vargas is a movie you definitely need to see. it was very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked right in. it is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through. victor, a cocky teen, but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places dealing with girls and family. at the end victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with a old fashioned grandmother and a girl who he wants to use is actually using him too.i recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like you are watching a real family. thats how much feeling this movie has. one heart felt moment was when victor's grandmother throws victor out over something simple. victor was really heart and couldn't believe that she would do something like that. it made me feel real sorry for him like it was real. overall i give this movie a b+
