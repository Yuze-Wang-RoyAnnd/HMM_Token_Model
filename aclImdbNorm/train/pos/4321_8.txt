i'll keep this one quite short. i believe that this is an extraordinary movie. i see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's badly written, poorly shot, has a terrible soundtrack and, worse, that it's not real in its portrayal of life. ok, so it may not be quite believable for its whole length, but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed. hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives. gangland violence is real, right? is it right, no! this movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised, rather than denigrated. i have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times, each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving (well not until 2008 anyway). 9 out of 10 from me for this one. it's very nearly perfect in my view. jmv
