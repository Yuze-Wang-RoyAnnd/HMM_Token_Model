"winchester '73" marked the first of a series of westerns involving james stewart and director anthony mann. as in most of them stewart's hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time.<br /><br /> the title refers to a "one in a thousand" rifle that is up for competition at a rifle shoot held in dodge city on july 4, 1876. into town comes lin mcadam (stewart) and his sidekick high spade (millard mitchell) who are on the trail of dutch henry brown (stephen mcnally) for a past dastardly deed. they arrive just in time to see marshal wyatt earp (will geer) running saloon girl lola (shelley winters) out of town. it turns out that dutch henry is also in town for the rifle shoot. lin and dutch henry shoot it out for the coveted prize with lin winning but dutch henry robs lin of the gun and escapes.<br /><br /> lin and high spade trail dutch henry across country where they encounter lola with her cowardly beau steve miller (charles drake) hold up in a u.s. cavalry camp awaiting attack by the indians led by young bull (rock hudson) who has acquired the prized rifle by murdering wily gun runner john mcintyre. he had got the weapon by cheating dutch henry at poker. young bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to steve.<br /><br /> meanwhile, back at the ranch, lola and steve meet up with notorious gunman waco johnny dean (dan duryea) who kills steve and takes the valued rifle and lola for himself. when dean meets up with dutch henry, he allows him to take back "his gun" planning to murder him later. in the town of tuscosa, lin kills dean as dutch henry's plans of holding up the bank go bad and he escapes into the hills with lin in pursuit. in one of the best final shoot outs ever, the two meet in the final showdown.<br /><br /> i believe that this movie was the only one of the stewart/mann collaborations that was shot in b&w. it is beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the "wide open spaces" and in particular, the final showdown. stewart playing against type, plays the hero with a violent revenge motive edge, an emotion that he would carry into future films with mann.<br /><br /> as in most universal westerns, this one boasts a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day. in addition to those mentioned above, j.c. flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, steve brodie, james millican, john doucette and chuck roberson as various henchmen, ray teal as the sheriff pursuing duryea, tony curtis and james best as rookie soldiers and edmund cobb, chief yowlachie and john war eagle in various roles in the dodge city sequence.<br /><br /> a classic western in every sense of the word. it was responsible for re-generating stewart's career as an action star.
