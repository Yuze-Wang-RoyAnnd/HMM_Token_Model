i have bought the dvd of this version to compare against the current bbc 2005 version (which is brilliant). the 1985 was adapted by arthur hopcraft, who adapted tinker tailor soldier spy for tv and who died this year (2005). i remember great acting, especially from rigg and elliott, and moving music. (music in the 2005 version is far more understated, but very telling.) just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points: richard carstone is ada claire's boyfriend, not esther's. esther had no uncle. charlie drake never played krook in either version, nor did he play toby esterhase in ttss! krook is played by comedian johnny vegas in the 2005 version. toby was played by bernard hepton.<br /><br />both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of dickens' great novel. now read the book! it's not perfect, and the sentimentality may make you wince at times, but i defy you not to cry - and laugh!
