#3 in young john travolta's trilogy of blockbusters. he dances to disco, rock 'n' roll and country. he heads to houston to find work and love. gilley's is the hot spot, and it is the time of the mechanical bull. not to be outdone, i rode the bull at a club in nashville. i recently saw this nearly forgotten film on television and remembered how good it was and how good a year 1980 was. i wore a black cowboy hat that year just like travolta. debra winger was in her prime. she looks stunning in her red top. there is plenty of charisma. bud and sissy seem the ideal couple even if they are trailer trash. they split up just because it feels so good getting back together. urban cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. we get to hear lyin' eyes by the eagles and lookin' for love by johnny lee.
