at times, this overtakes the thing as my favourite horror film. while carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier. it's one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. i try not to compare it to the book
