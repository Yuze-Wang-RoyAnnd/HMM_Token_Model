ed harris's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence, that is, he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it, and that includes the formidable sean connery. the movie, which is more than a bit sanctimonious, comes alive only in the scenes when harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict. it is breathtaking, a master class in artistic control.<br /><br />the other cast members are all adept and connery is reliable, as is fishbourne, but the story itself packs no wallop. the plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers. this is the engine which drives the story, right or wrong, and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end.<br /><br />still, worth watching to see harris in action.
