i watched this movie once and might watch it again, but although jamie foxx is good in the movie, i feel they could have used a 'less funny' character as alvin sanders. foxx's scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar clenteen (david morse) are too funny. david morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop. his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role. once again morse meets doug hutchinson (bristol) in the theater. morse ends up coming down hard on hutchinson. they are both perfect for this scenario in each film. i personally love that quality in a film, where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film, as these two did in the green mile. overall it was a pretty good movie.
