in my opinion this has to be one of barbara stanwyck's best performances. she was one of only a handful of actors, then and now, who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue. and i was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie, with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage. too bad the movie is so short. lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal speakeasy. her only link to anything is her good friend, chico, played wonderfully by theresa harris. though chico is african american (and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie), and lily is not, they have a special bond. and it is not sexual. just 2 women stuck, or shoved, into a situation beyond their control. after lily's father dies, and she does not know what she will do, she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants. yes, it's immoral, but that's the entire point of this movie. then "they" had to go and ruin the last few minutes. so, up until the last few minutes of the movie, it's a superb film and worth watching. the "lesson" of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then, and i'm sure will be a 100 years from now. women, it's awful what lily does in order to get what she wants, but it works. men, take note.
