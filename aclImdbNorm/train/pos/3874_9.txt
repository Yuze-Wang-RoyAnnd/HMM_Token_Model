and i absolutely adore isabelle blais!!! she was so cute in this movie, and far different from her role in "quebec-montreal" where she was more like a man-eater. i think she should have been nominated for a jutra. i mean, syvlie moreau was good, but isabelle was far superior, imo. pelletier has done fine work for his first time out, and i noticed he snuck in a couple of his buddies from rock et belles oreilles, guy a. lepage & andre ducharme. it was fun to see them in this, i didn't know they were going to appear.<br /><br />i don't think i've seen a romantic comedy from quebec that i didn't like, and this one is as good as any i've had the pleasure to see. and if you're in the states and wondering how you can get a copy of the dvd, www.archambault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week.
