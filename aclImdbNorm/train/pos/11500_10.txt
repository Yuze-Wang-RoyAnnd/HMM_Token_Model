if mulder was looking for his real father here he is darren mcgavin, the first x files, pity it was only one season long the producers of this show didn't know that they had the makings of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came chris carter with what i call the follow up to the night stalker, the x files. both will go down as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should appear in the x files years later darren mcgavin, as agent arthur dales helping our two favorite hero,s solving cases. paying homage to the man i think so, well done chris carter bringing back a forgotten tv show in the form of david duchovny as darren mcgavin if it wasn't for watching the x files and that particular show i would have never known about the night stalker.
