kenneth branagh shows off his excellent skill in both acting and writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of shakespeare's most classic and well-written tragedy. kenneth plays the role of hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears. kate winslet's performance is also of great note.
