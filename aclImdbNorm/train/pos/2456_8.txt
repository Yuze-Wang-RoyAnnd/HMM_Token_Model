when i went to watch this movie my expectations were really low, but i was pleasantly surprised. <br /><br />i thought i was going to watch a boring teen-flick, but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed, the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from melville who really shows his talent in this movie, and the fight scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done .<br /><br />i think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received. it is a movie, which can be seen by the whole family - maybe not the smallest of kids, since it contains some rather rough scenes. a movie about love, and the problems that can occur, when you go against your family traditions. <br /><br />yes, the movie is very much like "bend it like beckham", but i actually think this movie pulls it off better.
