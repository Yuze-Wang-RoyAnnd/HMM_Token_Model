to be honest i watched this movie only because of my pubert needs. i mean, i couldn't get women at my age (i was 9 or 10) so i thought watching elvira's cleavage was the closet thing to sex.<br /><br />i ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy, halloween parties, sassy humor, and some sexy evil displayed by elvira.<br /><br />they just don't make movies like this anymore... it had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style. <br /><br />the truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of it's humor and the ability to perform by cassandra. <br /><br />this is classic that reminds me of the good days of usa up all night.
