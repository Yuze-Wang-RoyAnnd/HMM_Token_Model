this movie is so wonderful, it's hard to find words to describe it. this is the only time i can't decide which was better, the book or the movie.<br /><br />whoopi goldberg is awesome, and oprah winfrey, such a good actress, she could be funny, happy and miserable all at the same time. all together the movie was well directed by steven speilberg, and should not be passed up. 9/10
