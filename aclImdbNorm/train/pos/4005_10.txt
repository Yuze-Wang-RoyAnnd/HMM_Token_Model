although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate, i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman.<br /><br />i'm so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it, and even if they had, they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters.<br /><br />the story is revealed slowly and realistically. the acting is superb, the characters are believably flawed, and the dialogue is sensitive. i tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and i was always wrong, so i was very intrigued by the story.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie. and i must confess, i'll forever look at my mom in a different light!
