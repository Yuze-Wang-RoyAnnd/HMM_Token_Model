this is the kind of movie england can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment. because of the success of very british comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the twentieth century, most notably adaptations of e. m. forster novels, this very merchant-ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. it was an exceptional year for actress miranda richardson, having appeared as the wife of jeremy irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in damage, and as the ira terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in the crying game. here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in rose arbuthnot, one who with josie lawrence who plays lottie wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. they are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one caroline dester, played by the enigmatic polly walker who resembles a very vamp louise brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and mrs. fisher (joan plowright). this foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. alfred molina and jim broadbent (then relatively new to american audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, mike newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder.
