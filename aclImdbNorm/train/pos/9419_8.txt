this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry, and a light eccentric character study as well.<br /><br />the pacing is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments. but it does have its amusing moments, and it is very deft in its execution. the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element.<br /><br />the union procedures are quite droll, very reminiscent of i'm all right jack; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness' character. the political machinations actually carry the story. ernest thesigner is very notable as a heavy.<br /><br />i don't think this one works quite as well as the ladykillers, or kind hearts and coronets; but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing.
