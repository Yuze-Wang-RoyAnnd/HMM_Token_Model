this was a great movie with a good cast, all of them hitting on all cylinders. and when dianne keaton is at her best, well, it just doesn't get any better than that. but tom everett scott, always underrated, was even better. he should be a star. <br /><br />my only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay. none of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn't always a good person. and neither was her mother, played by keaton. at one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around. <br /><br />one of the other commentators said the movie had a "political agenda". that is a baffling thing to say. there was no politics at all in this movie.
