i loved this film! i'm a true tom hanks fan, and i have always been impressed with all of his work. from his most dramatic roles like cast away, the green mile, saving private ryan, forrest gump, apollo 13 & philadelphia. to his hilarious roles like a league of their own, turner and hooch, catch me if you can, the lady killers, big & of course toy story. but in this film hanks isn't the only great actor who lights up the screen. tyler hoechlin, an up and coming star who shows great promise in hollywood co stars as hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance. he is certainly someone to watch out for over his career, i believe he will do great things. paul newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen. he is truly a legend. we can't forget the people who didn't have such big roles in the film, but still helped make it great. the beautiful & very talented jennifer jason leigh, who's performance in bastard out of carolina & single white female i will never forget, brings her grace to the screen as hank's wife in the film and does a superb job. liam aiken is another found treasure in film. he does such a great job with such a small role, and like his roles in lemony snickets, and sweet november, and i dreamed of africa he gives a great performance.
