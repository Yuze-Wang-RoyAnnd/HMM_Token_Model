not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography (screenplay, acting, setting, etc.) but also for it's realism. this movie could take place in any farm or rural setting. it makes no difference if the movie takes place in louisiana or if it would take place in kansas. the story and the messages it includes would remain the same. this movie shows family values and connections for an older audience, while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers. everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally, i know i did. the ending hits way too close to home for me not to burst into tears every time i watch it. the ending stresses the importance of farm safety, and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film. not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations.<br /><br />
