this show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. as a man married for 26 years, i empathize with patrick warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows that. i also enjoy his monotone delivery; never gets too excited or too low. a nice ensemble of characters. this will be a nice addition to the monday night line-up.<br /><br />i don't know how david spade will be in his role. he is best enjoyed in small doses. he also seems a little old to still be trolling for women.<br /><br />i enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops.
