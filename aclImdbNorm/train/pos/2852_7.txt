this movie has a very simple yet clever premise - an unemployed man trying to steal from a convenience store, and the store clerk catches him in the act... the thief runs away with the store-clerk right after him. all the while, the store clerk is in trouble with a low-rank yakuza chinpira (gangster). along the chase for the thief, they catch the eye of the yakuza who's been looking for the convenience store clerk. the story then moves into high gear in the form of a tom & jerry (cat & mouse), but is added with the dog chasing after the cat. the entire 2nd act of d.a.n.g.a.n. runner (can be translate to english as "pinball runners") is about the chase, and the chase goes on & on to the point that by the end of the 2nd act, the bum forgets why he is running away, and the yakuza don't remember which of the 2 guys he is chasing, nor does he remember why they're running away from him.<br /><br />similar to sabu's later film postman blues, the bulk of the film is simply all chase and action, with plenty of physical comedy and dark humor injected to keep the audience engaged. what falls short is the ending, to which the chase stops when the three men run out of steam, and into one of the most chaotic mexican stand-offs you'll see on film that looks almost as if sabu was paying homage to tony scott's true romance (written by quentin tarantino).
