first of all i am a butch, straight white male. but even with that handicap i love this movie. it's about real people. a real time and place. and of course new york city in the 80's. i had many gay friends growing up in new york in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them. no matter what the consequences. that's courageous. you have to admire that. this is a great film, watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant african american or hispanic gay man in the new york of the eighties. it's real life. bottom line it's real life.
