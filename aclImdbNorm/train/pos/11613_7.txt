distortion is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise.. a sort of multi layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right at this moment. to be more concise, he feels that his wife is cheating on him, so he hires a private eye to snoop on him. his wife has no idea that this is happening. meanwhile, the actors in this play are also having a few whoopdedoodles up their sleeves by fooling around with each other and with, shall we say, unscrupulous people in the world of israel. the whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable (but not really) happens.<br /><br />the director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the ensemble cast of characters, and edits in a way that makes you pay attention, this is a fun film actually, one which i didn't mind viewing and would recommend people check out.
