my interest was raised as i was flipping through and saw the name iphigenia. my name is eugenia so i thought ok, lets see what this is. i am so glad i stayed on the channel. what a wonderful, wonderful story. drama, sadness, some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had. i watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over. give iphigenia a try and i hope you will enjoy it as much as i did. i have even gotten my children (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. it starts slow, however, the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story. watching this lovely film made me want to shroud myself in more greek tragedy and pathos.
