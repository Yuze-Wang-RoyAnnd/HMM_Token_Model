mardi gras: made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but, are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another. david redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in america for up to 20 dollars. when redmon questions americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded. when he told them that they are made in china for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, americans seemed sad, hurt, and a little remorseful but didn't really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth. when redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads. the workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn't believe it. this movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own.<br /><br />m. pitts
