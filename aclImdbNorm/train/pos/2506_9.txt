moon child was one of the more symbolic movies i've seen. what i really liked about it was the illustration on immorality/mortality,and the obstacles and guidances through life. the movie depicts a great deal of vampire kei having the power of immorality and the advantages to it. whether if it is having supernatural abilities or everlasting life, these are what humans usually wish for. moon child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal, since the feelings towards loss impacts almost all the characters especially to the main characters sho and kei. the meaning of the title 'moon child' reveals as the film comes close to the end where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon which shines other people's way, giving guidance. i personality quite like that moral the movie depicted on. the weaknesses of the film lies in some parts of the acting and special effects since it made the film less authentic. the scene where character toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the acting were put into it. some scenes with special effects like the gun shots also could have been more authentic without making it seem too much like an action video game. the sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and i think that could have been eliminated or fixed. nevertheless, i think moon child should be a movie everyone should consider watching. the symbolic ideas and images the movie brings out would be easily accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers. it is quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch.
