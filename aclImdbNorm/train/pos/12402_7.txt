**warning! spoilers ahead!**<br /><br />this short is part one of two that expound upon the brief portion of "the matrix" in which morpheus explains how the matrix came to be. because we already know the story, the plot itself is no surprise; and the short isn't so much entertaining as informative. but that's how it is presented, as a file in the historical archives. the visuals are better than average, and the generally cold colors aid the purpose of the short.<br /><br />a couple problems. the violence of the tale is a little gratuitous and, combined with the occasional dose of political correctness (un scenes), detracts from the straight narrative of the short. plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete.<br /><br />the animatrix concept is brilliant, and despite a few issues, this short still fulfills its purpose. it would not have fit in the original movie in style, content, or flow. this is the perfect method to reveal the history.<br /><br />bottom line: good information. could have been told a little better, but still a solid 7 of 10.
