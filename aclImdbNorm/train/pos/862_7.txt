carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. when she finds herself overloaded at work, she is able to hire paul to help her out. paul is just out of jail, and his past is not entirely behind him. to say too much more about the story, which has many twists, would be a mistake.<br /><br />the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she can't -- a sort of "point of hear" (like point of view). the early scenes that set this up, as well as the early character development of carla and paul, was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on, some of which were hard to follow and/or stretched credibility a bit. there is also some unpleasant violence. back to the positive side, the cinematography was very good.<br /><br />the film is worth seeing, but perhaps not seeking out. seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4/28/2002.
