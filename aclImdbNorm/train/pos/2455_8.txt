it's a rather good movie, but too americanised in it's predictability. change the kung fu for football and the turkish family for a pakistani one, and you get to watch bend it like beckham (2002) almost scene for scene. a nice feature the serves as the backbone of the movie is the progression of fights with the mysterious ninja under the highway, beginning with miserable losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a win against oneself, as the kung fu master stressed several times. on a different level, the danish life is revealed quite different than the image it has by outsiders: the non indigenous immigrants that make a large proportion (actually, the majority) of the danish citizenry, the graffiti in the copenhagen suburbs, the taunting of the immigrant girl in the begging of the movie. all portray a different picture than one has in mind when one hears the word denmark.
