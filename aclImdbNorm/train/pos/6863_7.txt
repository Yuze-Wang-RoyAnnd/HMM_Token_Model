a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. director-writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock-imitation (many called it a "ripoff") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-tv tapes).<br /><br />the downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-nypd dennis franz (who has hair here!). <br /><br />the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies.<br /><br />there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder. the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is, it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women.
