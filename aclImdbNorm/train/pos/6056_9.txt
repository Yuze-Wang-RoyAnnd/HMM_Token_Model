super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. the imax camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around various tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand prix (if only that would appear on dvd!). i enjoy watching it again and again.<br /><br />the only minus, and why i didn't give it a 10, is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up. the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. you won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges.
