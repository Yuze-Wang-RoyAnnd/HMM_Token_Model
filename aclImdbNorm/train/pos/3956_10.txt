husbands beware is a remake of the shemp classic brideless groom. the film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great. the stooges are always funny when they cook. however after the first few minutes of cooking footage, we cut to original footage of brideless groom. one thing i noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do fit with the new story. they do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match.<br /><br />husbands beware does have a new ending, but i won't give it away to those who want to be surprised.<br /><br /> **** out of 4 stars.
