i saw this film 12 years ago on tnt. it was susanah york's birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with tom jones (1963). i have not seen this film on tv since. i took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented jim dale, as lusty the sailor. i believe that dale now does the narration of the harry potter books on casette, but anyway he is quite funny. this is a fast paced comedy. it is not on vhs or dvd. columbia pictures should go through their film collection, and consider restoring and releasing this film to dvd. christopher plummer is hilarious as lord fopington, ian bannen is also quite humorous as ramble the sailor. this is a bawdy comedy, the kind of film one no longer sees, with great production values. ***1/2 stars out of ****
