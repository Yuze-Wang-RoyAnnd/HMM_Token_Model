yeah,it's low budget. yeah,it's one of candy's earliest films, but it is maybe his funniest! john candy was not so far removed from his sctv days in "going berserk" and it shows. if you don't crack up when candy tries to help a guy with his groceries while being hand-cuffed to an escaped cohort in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with only the apartment door separating them (huh?, see the movie!), or the way euguene levy (the creator of kong fu yu) is talking to his mom on the phone, or just the countless number of facial expressions that only candy could deliver you better check your pulse! if you like the john candy of "only the lonely" this is may not be a movie i would advise you to see, but if you enjoy the sctv days of john candy, this movie is a must see!
