i saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out, (i don't remember exactly when.) i thought that it was alright, for a ben stiller movie. this movie isn't for a person without a good sense of humor. like most of ben stiller's jokes you have to think about them. or like i said you have a good sense of humor. from a couple of people on this website i saw that people didn't have anything good to say about it and it didn't get a very good rating, but i would have given it a larger one this movie, i thought, was very good and it should have gotten a better rating. maybe this isn't a movie for you. i'm just giving you another person's opinion.
