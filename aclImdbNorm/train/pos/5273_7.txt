this was directed by ruggero deodato, a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the seminal and notorious cannibal holocaust. however, don't expect to find any such notoriety in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a conan inspired outing for a young audience.<br /><br />such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole conan inspired sword & sorcery genre but before you turn your nose up at this, it has to be said, this movie is just so much fun!<br /><br />it's mostly played for laughs and features two huge and highly likable heroes in the form of david and peter paul aka. the barbarian brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters.<br /><br />b-movie favourite richard lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it's also great to see roles for big george eastman and michael berryman.<br /><br />added to this, the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily attired throughout the films duration (a staple and much welcomed ingredient in the genre!)<br /><br />what can i say, - this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and i recommend it wholeheartedly!
