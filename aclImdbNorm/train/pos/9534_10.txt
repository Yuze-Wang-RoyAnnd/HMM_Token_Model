acting this film is a very well acted film. i will say that the performances are slightly weak at times; but for the most part, the acting is very good. the only actor that blew me away with his performance was jude law as harlen maguire. he was incredible! tom hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible. paul newman, good as always. cinematography this is what made the movie a masterpiece (and i rarely use that word). conrad hall is a true genius. if at any point in the movie you were to pause it, you will see the delicately crafted work of this man. he sets up every shot so that nothing is left out. when the camera is still, there is a postcard like quality to the screen. when the camera is moving, every shot is planned to understated perfection. but it doesn't stop there. conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. the way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work i've seen. his work on this movie made it what it is. this movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with lotr, black hawk down, hero, cthd, moulin rouge, and vertigo. story people will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but, i believe they missed the point of the movie. it is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. it is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other. the screen writing is worthy of an oscar. music thomas newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story. the music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores i've herd. direction sam mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director. the symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world. i will be on the lookout for the next sam mendes film. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies i've ever seen.
