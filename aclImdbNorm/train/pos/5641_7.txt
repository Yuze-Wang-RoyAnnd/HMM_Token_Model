yes, the plot is predictable; yes, there are a few plot holes; yes, it has a made-for-tv quality; and yes, britney spears "wrote" the book with obvious self-promotion.<br /><br />but forget all of that... this movie is fun.<br /><br />fun in an after school special sort-of-way, but fun nevertheless.<br /><br />virginia madsen as the mother does a great job... so good that i'm going to start watching for her movies. she reminded me of diane lane for all the good reasons.<br /><br />the rest of the cast does a fine job, too. if i was a casting agent, i'd be scouting some of these young actors.<br /><br />the production values are above usual tv standards and the music was really great... better than several big-budget movies i've seen.<br /><br />if you're in the mood for german noir this movie isn't for you. if you want a safe, fun and underrated movie, this is a good one. it's one you could show to your 10 year old daughter but enjoy it yourself too.
