some films manage to survive almost on originality alone - "wonderland" is certainly one of those films. the script manages to throw everything into a near-fever pitch, but without making it incoherent. the speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up a weak script, but rather to accurately reflect the drug-addled reality.<br /><br />as director, james cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors. most of the characters are perpetually on edge, and often because they're rather quite ugly personalities. val kilmer has described john holmes to be a hustler, able to manipulate and control. no offense to kilmer, but his version of holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak-minded. nonetheless, it's a stunning performance. comparing this to kilmer's more 'hollywood' roles like in "the saint" it seems to prove he is far more at home in gritty indie flicks.<br /><br />the actors are the main force holding all together. there are various little performances that stand out - especially the women. carrie fisher, kate bosworth, and lisa kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. aside from kilmer, ted levine and dylan mcdermott give a weird, stunning energy to their roles.<br /><br />i originally put off watching "wonderland" because i assumed it was a film about a porn actor, in the strictest sense. yes, the story revolves around john holmes, but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career. basically, this film is a murder mystery, and as such - it's excellent.<br /><br />rating: 7.5 out of 10
