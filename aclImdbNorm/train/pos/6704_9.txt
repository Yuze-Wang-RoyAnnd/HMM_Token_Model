for the first three seasons, sabrina was a gem hidden away on tgif (and later, early school-day afternoon reruns). each episode had a maniac, zany energy and rapid-fire pacing that overcame the occasional awkward joke. melissa joan hart exuded a keen talent for physical comedy, particularly in her facial expressions. her two aunts, playing the "straight men," or as straight as two witches could be, had great comic timing and general chemistry with hart. salem, as a talking cat, was free to dabble in whatever mad scheme he was interested in, and one could laugh and take it all in stride because he was, after all, a talking cat. sabrina's friends rounded out the social experience at school, in which also housed the typical "evil cheerleader" and "totalitarian principal." perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to merge pop culture (e.g., bands of the era, jerry springer), archetypal human condition/morality (e.g., the importance of friendship, the spirit of christmas), and the literal representation of such related metaphors in the magical realm. unfortunately, like so many other shows throughout the age of television, the show hit its peak during the first three years, which coincided with sabrina attending high school. starting in season four, the move to college marked what would become a precipitous decline in the general quality of the show, particularly when the writers chose to introduce josh as harvey's rival, and concocting thin excuses for aunts hilda and zelda to remain on-screen as key players. the final season, where sabrina works at a pop culture magazine, was unequivocally disappointing. still, in the end, sabrina (particularly the high school years) remains a unique entry as a hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that elevates it above the tiresome fare that is produced in this genre every year.
