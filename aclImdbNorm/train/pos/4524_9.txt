this is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism (of heterosexuals). the film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character. adrian pasdar is very believable as gerald/geraldine and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting. the directing of christopher monger is very sensitively, treating such a difficult issue quite excellently, packed into a good story. not a big movie, neither an "art" film, but a little, lovely motion picture!
