this movie took my breath away at some points, i simply loved it! <br /><br />i admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better, but hey, this is just a simple (short) story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon, there's nothing more to it!<br /><br />the overall design, atmosphere, the beautiful landscapes... it's all just magical! <br /><br />they've put a lot of love in this movie. character designs were great and funny. a bit tim burton-ish if you like. i can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design, displayed in a simple small, but lovely story.
