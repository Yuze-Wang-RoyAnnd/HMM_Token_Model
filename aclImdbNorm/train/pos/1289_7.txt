first of all the movie, is an ingenious work of art(movie). the plot was filled with surprises, a little kid pretends to be a grown up inherits one million dollars and how he spends it. i mean how whacked out is this. walt disney really outdid themselves this time. the comedy is most of the times expected but the other times unexpected. i mean was this movie ok or was this movie ok. it also teaches a lot about wise youths and i this kid is really wise and a bit time smart pants. but also it sucks. how the heck could a guy like that kid get a hot police babe and his dad let him go free. that's like let a killer get bailed free for ten years. if i were to do that i'd get beaten with a 'suble jack'(a huge stick that stings when used to bench your butts really hard). that kid is really lucky. back to the story. the movie makers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie but still it's not perfect. the acting was good and bad. the kid and woman had no chemistry neither did the father but the bros were excellent'. the special effects on the other hand was lame. plus this movie isn't based on reality. i hated and loved it at the same time.
