here's a decent mid-70's horror flick about a gate of hell in nyc that just happens to be an old brownstone. seems like there's lots of gates of hell around, but of course this unwitting model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriend/fianc'ee and so she just happens to pick one, which is disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment. she meets several strange neighbors, and even attends a birthday party for a cat. upon meeting with the realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs, she finds out that she and an old priest are supposed to be the only tenants. whoa! then who are all these weirdos? her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by chris sarandon) starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem, not by a long shot. this has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the creaky old folks that are her "sometimes" neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing. a bit of decent gore and even a parade of less-than-normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch, and while i've seen this many times on tv the uncut dvd version is much better, of course. not a bad little horror flick, maybe a good companion piece to "burnt offerings". 8 out of 10.
