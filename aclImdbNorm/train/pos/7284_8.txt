when i was young i had seen very few movies. my parents in all their wisdom rented this one. i was very wary of what the movie was about, in fact i wasn't even allowed to watch it. my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry. so what did i do? late at night i trashed the vcr! kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals. i was arrested of course, i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived. i was only given a stern talking to and sent home. my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr. this tore me apart, slave labour really sucks believe me, but i had to do it. chores all around the house. what happened in the end? we got a big screen tv, dvd player and a surround sound system for my work. how did i get the money? easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney! do you remember finding neno? well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks! they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldn't afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done! in the end i never saw the film the head that didn't die and the rating i gave it is my life rating! it's doing pretty good!
