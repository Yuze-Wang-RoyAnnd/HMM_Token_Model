director douglas sirk scores again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. this lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all of the elements of sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. "written on the wind" very obviously influenced the 1980s tv series "dallas" and "dynasty", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.<br /><br />lauren bacall, wonderfully and subtly, plays lucy moore, a new york city secretary who marries oil baron, kyle hadley (robert stack). unbeknownst to both of them, mitch wayne (rock hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but sexy secretary. they all go back to kyle's family's mansion in texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister, marylee (dorothy malone in an oscar-winning turn). yipee! the sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a campy trip. not only does mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is mitch. topping it all off, kyle learns he's impotent, but somehow lucy ends up pregnant.<br /><br />this is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. how can you not love it? this film signals one of universal's most popular films and one of director sirk's best works. some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great. the cast is great, although bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind hudson. stack's oscar loss reportedly devastated him. he considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. and he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic. what a stunning movie! this film proves what i've been thinking for ages - sirk is the master of classic melodrama. where's his oscar?<br /><br />
