when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long, i thought we were in trouble. condensing the gigantic w. somerset maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen. but you know, the movie's not half bad, and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers.<br /><br />i've heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet noodle of an actor, and he was, but i can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet noodle, for that's certainly what carey is. howard plays him well, which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly, then finally take him out and buy him a spine.<br /><br />ah, and then there's bette, as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him. i didn't know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book, and the movie stays true to that detail. but as played by davis, she does become the most fascinating character in the story, and if she's nasty and unlikable, she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time. davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting, much as brando's would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out "stella!!" in that little-known tennesee williams play, and it's not hard to see why. davis is intense to the point of scary. she makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience, and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous. her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease (though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an std) is shocking. of course, it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect; if it had been made a year later, you can bet things would have been a bit different.<br /><br />yes, much of the novel, and many of its most interesting parts, are left on the cutting room floor, and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else. i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of maugham's novel, but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now, so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did.<br /><br />grade: b+
