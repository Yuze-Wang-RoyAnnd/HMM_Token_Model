my name is domino harvery. {edit *dizzying* chop} my--my--my name is domino harvey. {cut, chop} my name is domino harvey. {edit. cut. playback}<br /><br />never have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before. by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scott's choppy, flashy, dizzying editing technique. if i have to choose between loving it and hating it, i'd say i love it. it was borderline distracting at times, but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality (even if it borrows heavily from mtv videos).<br /><br />this stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy. otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her, no matter how much she suffered. we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke, rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez. the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walken's tv production company (what is christopher walken doing in every film, by the way?). i guess that is a clever film technique, because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtv/reality show editing footage as he likes. it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this point.<br /><br />it followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace, with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence. there are some funny jokes; it's all very modern and surreal at the same time. it's a mess, but it's a rather enjoyable mess. it is ultimately flawed in so many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters "cool", for one) but it works. i give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graded this film
