i try to watch it everyday most of the time, and even though i have watched it for the past 4 years, i have not seen every episode.<br /><br />the show is about danny tanner who is guy who does news for sports. his wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks jesse, an elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession of his hair. joey, an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls, donna joe, they call her d.j., stephinie who is the second oldest and michelle, the youngest.<br /><br />they all live under one roof with no one to help them out.<br /><br />later in the show, jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have twins, nicki and alex. (this starts to happen in the new seasons) this show is awesome, if you like the suite life of zack and cody, that's so raven, boy meets world, and designing woman, you will love this. (it starts to get better in the ending seasons) watch it, you will love it!
