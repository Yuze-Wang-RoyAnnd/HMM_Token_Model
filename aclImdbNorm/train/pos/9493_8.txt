white fire has so much going for it. with larry bird look-alike robert ginty leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache, the movie soars above other low-budget actioners. the charisma he has in this makes tom selleck look like a putz. with ginty beating up everyone, the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play. then add in fred williamson, some frontal bush, chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest themes....this flick ends up delivering on all cylinders. if you're looking for some awesome b-action, this is where it's at. now, if i can just get my hands on that soundtrack.
