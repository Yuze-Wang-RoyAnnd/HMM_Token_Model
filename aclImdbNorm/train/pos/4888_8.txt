this has just been broadcast on bbc and i am absolutely delighted to have seen it. as the credits rolled, the cast alone made certain that i would give it a go. after just five minutes i was completely immersed in this beautiful film.<br /><br />yes it was formulaic and predictable, but that somehow added to it's charm. the flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling equalled in few productions.<br /><br />a real feel-good film, punctuated throughout with outstanding music. when it's released, i'll buy it!
