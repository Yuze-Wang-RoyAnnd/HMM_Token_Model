i swear when i first saw this movie,i cried my eyes out! a star is born is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles john norman (kris kristofferson) and esther (streisand) face. you also experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. streisand and kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! when streisand sings with one more look at you/watch closely now, it's just pure magic! this movie made the song evergreen one of my favorites,and queen bee is such a fun song. also i love the fashion of the '70s (except streisand's afro. besides that,she's a beauty.). a star is born is my number one favorite movie. this movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart-breaker at the end.
