as i am no fan of almost any post-"desperate living" john waters films, i warmed to "pecker". after he emerged from the underground, waters produced trash-lite versions of his earlier works ("cry baby", "polyester", hairspray") that to die-hard fans looked and tasted like watered down liqueur. "pecker", which doesn't attempt to regurgitate early successes, is a slight, quiet, humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world. waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you couldn't imagine anyone being able to give away if it wasn't emblazoned with the waters "name". edward furlong is fine as "pecker" and waters' non-histrionic style is at ease with the subject.
