i thought this movie was very well put together. the voice-overs were also great. i liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. i would recommend this movie to anyone. it was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. other scenes made me sad. and others made me glad. it is a movie any age can enjoy. from the moment milo is the crazy "profesor" or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. after i watched the movie, i read the book. it was good as well, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. it is just like the book. but go ahead and watch this movie!
