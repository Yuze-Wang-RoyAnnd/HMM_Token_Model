peter falk is a diverse and accomplished actor. the movie is well written and the acting seems like real life. for all lovers of columbo this is a superior piece of work. because it shows what a talent peter falk is. he doesn't play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman. by the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again. the interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it; the depth of its' pertinence will be the only thing that varies. it is a shame that the liberals in hollywood only promote smut and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of. this would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play.
