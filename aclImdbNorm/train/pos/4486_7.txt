spoilers<br /><br />tom and jerry is a classic cartoon, with a flawless idea, and almost every single short is a gem. while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts, there is not way you can hate this cartoon. sure, it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes, and i can say that i agree, but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great, but some are just better than others. well, this would fit into "others." <br /><br />here is the plot of fraidy cat. tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast, and becomes easily frightened. jerry observes how scared he is, and tries to scare him even more than he already is. he creates scary dilemmas for tom, and tom becomes scared out of his wits, and his lives. jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it, thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost. tom finds out that jerry did all of this, and chases him. tom then accidentally bites the house maid. however, at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup.<br /><br />overall, this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there, but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time. it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this. the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short, but it felt like something was missing in this. it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts. anyway, this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons, but it is still nice.<br /><br />7/10
