clint eastwood would star again as the battle-weary detective harry callahan, but would also direct the fourth entry in the 'dirty harry' series. 'sudden impact' again like the other additions, brings its own distinguishable style and tone, but if anything it's probably the most similar to the original in it's darker and seedy moments (and bestowing a classic line "go ahead. make my day")
