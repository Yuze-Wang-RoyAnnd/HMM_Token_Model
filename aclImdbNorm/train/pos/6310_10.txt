having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the slavic village-broadway area i couldn't wait to see it's final copy.<br /><br />viewing this film at the cleveland premier last friday,i haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time! it is great slapstick. the russo brothers did a fine job directing. the entire cast performs their best comedic acting... no slow or dry segments... george clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick. i was most imprest by william h. macy as crook "riley" and michael jeter's as "toto" they keep you in "stitches". i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie.
