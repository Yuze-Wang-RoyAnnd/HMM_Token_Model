young beautiful eva (hedy lamarr) marries an older man (zvonimir rogoz). unfortunately he can't satisfy her sexually and ignores her. frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce. then, one day, she's skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods. her horse gallops off with her clothes...and she runs after it! she meets young and very handsome adam (aribert mog). they make love and she realizes this is the man she wants.<br /><br />ending spoiler!!!! naturally, since this was made in 1933, she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale. end of ending spoiler!!!!<br /><br />this horrified people in 1933 but it's pretty tame by today's standards. lamarr's nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude, it's either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such. there's only a few minor shots of her breasts. also when she has sex with mog, nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm. these scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the american release. now today they're back in. this film would get by with a pg-13 easily now.<br /><br />shock episodes aside this is just ok. it is beautifully filmed and there's next to no dialogue. except for the music score this could be a silent picture. luckily all the actors are good--lamarr and mog especially and they're so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them. also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences i've ever seen in a movie. the scenes with the sexual symbolism (there's quite a few of them) are unfortunately pretty obvious today. i actually started to giggle during one!<br /><br />so, great direction, beautiful imagery, attractive actors, good acting all around--but i wasn't exactly bowled over by it. i found the movie slow-moving (beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me), somewhat dull, obvious, static and had a negative ending. i can live with the ending but it doesn't excuse the other problems i had with it. also the final sequence is really strange--and out of place. so i admire this film more than anything else. it was well-done and i'd recommend it but with caution. many people seem to love this movie so i'm in the minority. use your own judgment.
