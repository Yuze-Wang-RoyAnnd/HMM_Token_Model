saw it first in 1975 on some german tv channel and was hooked immediately, afterwards i saw this movie around 12 times in cinemas and nowadays i have a videotape which i watch at least once a year - this movie is excellent in every aspect (direction, acting, cut, musical score...). the sets are outstanding and very impressive, the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film, the dictator of "everytown" is pure mussolini and raymond massey is just charming, believable and ideally cast as "the hero". the positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing by todays usually pessimistic standards - especially the finishing scene which always brings a tear or two to my eyes, even after watching the film so many times.<br /><br />this movie is good on tv but it was made for the big screen, so if you have an opportunity to see it in some cinema. please do, it's overwhelming.
