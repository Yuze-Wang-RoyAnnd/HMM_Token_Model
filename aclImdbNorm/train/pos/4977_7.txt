so many educational films are nothing more than mind-numbing drudgery, saved only by the fact that "mst3k" mocks them ("why study industrial arts?" comes to mind). "hemo the magnificent" is actually quite well done. it's all about blood, the heart, and the circulatory system. i admit that i don't remember everything from it, but it does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious but entertaining. i guess that you can always count on june foray (most famously the voice of rocky the squirrel, she plays a deer here).<br /><br />since "hemo the magnificent" itself may be hard to find, probably the best place to see it is in "gremlins": a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming.
