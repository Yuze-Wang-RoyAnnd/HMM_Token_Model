love at the top--the utterly wrongheaded american title for the superb french film "le mouton enrage" (which means, i think, the rabid sheep)-- is such an original movie, the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more astounding. this film was far ahead of its time; even by today's highest standards, it accomplishes things that seem rich and new. filmed by the hugely underrated director michel deville, it rather defies description in the way it combines social critique, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire into one wholly original mix--leaving for the end a major but subtle surprise to render all that has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable. the cast is splendid, ditto the writing and theme. but it's deville's delicious tone, keeping you constantly off-balance but enrapt, that pushes this "lost" film to a very high level indeed. (the written interview with the director on the "special features" section of the dvd is definitely worth reading if you have the time.)
