worth watching twice because of the rapid-paced causal shifts among several compelling stories, "bug" emerges as a wholly satisfying work of art that plays ever-optimistic love against myriad examples of frustrating reality.<br /><br />my favorite characters are wallace (john carroll lynch)whose overriding concern for life--from that of a cockroach to the airline passengers for whom he is partially responsible--frames the film; olive (christina kirk), who spends considerable time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband ernie (chris bauer); and mitchell, a cable tv technician with unbounded trust in fortune cookie messages: "you will meet the girl of your dreams."<br /><br />against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality, all generated by actions of the characters: parking tickets, a clogged drain in a chinese food/donut shop, tv disruption, a crushed auto fender, an obliterated dinner reservation that eventually results in cancellation of a hawaiian vacation.<br /><br />the film is funny: olive getting drunk at a chippendale performance, johnston (michael hitchcock)as a customer service rep attempting to deal with an irate customer, the germ-obsessive cyr (brian cox) facing a restaurant inspector, dwight (jamie kennedy) reacting to his girlfriend's refusal to have children by writing hostile chinese cookie fortunes: "your girlfriend is lying to you" and the guy who falls asleep while manning a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's missing cat.<br /><br />a minor story with public cable access host (darryl theirse) and a local acting teacher reading from "the boy in the bubble" expresses the major theme: love comes from the heart.<br /><br />"bug" entertains on much the same level as "trains, planes and automobiles" but on a lower budget and with a fresher eye.
