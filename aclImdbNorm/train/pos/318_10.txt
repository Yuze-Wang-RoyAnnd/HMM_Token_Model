this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made. it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly's going on. the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers, commercials, contests one enters by mail, and a host of other innovations. besides, what other movies have cameos by martin luther king, jr? to decipher the film, hunt down the director's book entitled i was curious. it'll all become clear. it's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking. a triumph. now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color *other* than white...the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible.
