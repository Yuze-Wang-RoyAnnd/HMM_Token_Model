this movie is fun to watch. if you liked "dave" with kevin klein, you will get a kick out of this. think "dave" gone south american as dreyfus plays jack noah, an actor between jobs, who is hand selected by the head of the island nation of parador's secret police, to replace the drunken sot of a dictator, alfonse simms, after he has had a heart attack and died. noah bumbles along, aided in his role by the ex-dictator's mistress, as they attempt to thwart the plans of raul julia. jonathan winters also makes an appearance as a hearty american 'emigr'e who turns out to be cia. also starring polly holiday and fernando rey. <br /><br />there are a few absurd moments such as the body of the old dictator be kept frozen for a year, and the final scene, where sonia braga, who has bee cradling the bloody, bullet riddled body of dreyfus is seen moments later all in pristine white, with nary a smudge on her. but all in all it is a great romp.
