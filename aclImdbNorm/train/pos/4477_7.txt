this one has a lot going for it - sinatra, styne, cahn, pamela britten -and a lesser amount of dross - iturbi, grayson - plus a little ho hum - kelly. it was sinatra's first real movie where the producer's spent a buck and you could see it on screen (previously he'd appeared in two low-budgeters, higher and higher and step lively) but if they'd only relied on the sinatra pipes and deep sixed grayson's plus iturbi's ego-tripping piano spots we'd have been left with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for sinatra. as it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two duets with kelly - we hate to leave, i begged her - to his own solos, what makes the sunset, the charm of you and i fall in love too easily. despite this step lively remains the best sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth the budget.
