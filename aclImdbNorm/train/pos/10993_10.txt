this movie is a gem because it moves with soft, but firm resolution.<br /><br />i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there, it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace. it's not about explosions, car chases, or flying bullets. you must be patient and instead, note the details here. it's sedate because that's what the main character is. the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds.<br /><br />i will not give spoilers-- because that destroys the point of watching. the plot is what you've read from the other postings: an average white-collar guy, seeking change and adventure, signs on for a corporate spy job. just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data. <br /><br />take it from there.<br /><br />this movie starts at a surreal walk-- with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential, underlying suburban paranoia.<br /><br />then it begins to accelerate.<br /><br />the acting on all parts is superb-- and yes, some of the acts are caricature characters. but they all fit, and they entertain. and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft, soft key sinister theme: all is not right at the beginning.<br /><br />and at the end: all is not what it seems.<br /><br />get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one-- and turn up the sound: this movie wants you to listen.
