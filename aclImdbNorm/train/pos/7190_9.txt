best of the zorro serials and one of my favorite serials, period. this is a period serial set right after the birth of mexico. the new nation is counting on the gold produced by this one town to keep the republic solvent. however a gold god, don del oro is stirring up the indians and stealing the gold for himself. its zorro and his band of men to the rescue. reed hadley is a winning zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he gets into a nice selection of scraps (most all of which were reused by the later zorro serials as well as other serials as well).the story moves and its nicely not clear who the real bad guy is. there is a reason that i've seen this the most of any serial i've seen, its simply a great action adventure film. the only thing i can compare it to is the mark of zorro with tyrone power or one of the other swashbucklers of the period. its super and highly recommended.
