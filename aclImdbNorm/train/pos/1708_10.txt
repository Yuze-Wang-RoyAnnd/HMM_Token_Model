looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people do for fun....<br /><br />i was lucky enough to see the film during its all-too-brief theatrical run. the audience laughed its heads off. i'm watching a tape of it as i type and it's still dang funny!<br /><br />it's also got a sweet side, with unexpected turns of genuine pathos. the late, great royal dano is especially effective as the lonely, down-on-his-luck farmer wrenchmuller. ariana richards and j.j. anderson are great as the lead kids. and the actors in the martian suits, although limited to mime, do a great job<br /><br />another thing to look for is the background details. the film is full of homages, pastiches, and references to other sf and fantasy films. take a look at the martian costumes next time. one of them is wearing a marty mcfly costume, another is a ghostbuster, a third is in a house atreides uniform, and a fourth is wearing a last starfighter flightsuit.
