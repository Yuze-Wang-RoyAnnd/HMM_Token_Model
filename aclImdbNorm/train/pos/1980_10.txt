one of the last great musicals of the 60s. i was 7 years old the first time i saw this movie, and it's always been a favorite since then. the musical numbers are all memorable. in the 60s the people who were cast in musicals actually had musical talent (unlike a certain academy award nominated current musical based in a large midwestern city). all of the main roles were beautifully cast...ron moody shines as fagin, as does shani wallis as nancy. oliver reed was a menacing bill sikes (who thankfully has no musical numbers, lol), and mark lester as oliver and jack wild as the dodger were great too. mark lester comes across as an innocent waif, which was what dickens intended when he wrote the book! then, of course there are the dozens of dancers who perform in "consider yourself," "i'd do anything" "who will buy" and "be back soon," many who were children! this is a great show for the whole family.
