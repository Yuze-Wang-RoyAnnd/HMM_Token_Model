while returning from a christmas eve shopping trip, an abused suburban housewife (basinger) finds herself in a fight for survival after a disagreement with a group of delinquent youths takes a violent turn.<br /><br />suffering the indignity of a straight to dvd release here in the u.k., susan montford's directorial debut will perhaps not be given the recognition it deserves. this is a shame, as the standard of the writing, directing and acting is very good indeed, and certainly surpasses the quality of your average straight to dvd flick.<br /><br />kim basinger gives her best performance in some time as the downtrodden wife of an abusive husband (craig sheffer). while sheffer is not really given anything more to do than be a threatening presence, it is in their brief scenes together that basinger connects - showing painful vulnerability yet hinting at the rage that will eventually boil over in her confrontations with the youths. it's a truly great, understated performance, her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played.<br /><br />lukas haas i initially thought was miscast, as he (along with the other three youths) just did not seem much of a threat. however, had all four youths been more physically imposing, the later scenes in which basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all. the fact that these are four average men, albeit slightly unhinged, is the key to why the film works as well as it does.<br /><br />apart from a few pacing issues during the latter half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over. some may be put off by the slow - burn nature of the opening scenes, or the abrupt ending. others by the at times brutal violence. i say give it a chance, it's certainly more deserving of your time than saw v.
