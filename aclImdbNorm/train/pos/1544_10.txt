this is an excellent but hard to find trippy world war i spy thriller in the inimitable 60's italian style. from the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by ennio morricone to the lesbian love scene with capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no man's land battle scenes with poison gas and german cavalry in full gas proof 'storm trooper' gear, this is a movie that should not be missed. it is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield. apart from the battle scenes, some of the production and special effects are primitive, apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes, but for lovers of 60's cinema it should not be an issue. i first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the foresight to tape it on vhs. i still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time.
