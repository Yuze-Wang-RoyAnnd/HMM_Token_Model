how can anyone argue the fact that urban cowboy was, and still is, the best document of texas life for the time period. consider the following: men beat their wives, get drunk at bars nightly, get married to settle a fight, commit adultery, and compete on mechanical bulls. try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly. they dont make them anymore. it seems current films are always about people with lots of money, they live in huge homes, drive expensive cars and don't work. this movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for pete's sake !<br /><br />anyway, i watch it at least once a week. no kidding. i have dissected this movie from end to end. feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary. consider the following scenes: bud sees sissy - they are split up - he amicably honks and waves, she flips him the bird - he returns half the peace sign honking his horn to add impact then tears off.<br /><br />buds mom calls him approx. 18 hours after he gets into town, on a sunday, to see if he has a job yet - all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid(x2), with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him.<br /><br />"you all live like pigs" think about why this scene is needed. think about it. was it necessary ? could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink ? god i love that !<br /><br />sissy allows wes to help her ride the bull. only a few days (or possibly the next day) after wes just kicked the crap out of her husband. steve asks - hey sissy, remember wes ? oh yeah, didnt you beat my husband up the other night, so let's get this lesson goin', to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one bud and sissy's many fights, which by the way all take place in public - in gilley's !<br /><br />the wedding reception picture taking session (oh the humanity !) could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way. "my legs are sweatin' momma"<br /><br />in conclusion, you don't put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology. it is a documentary of real life.<br /><br />i only wish there was a director's cut....
