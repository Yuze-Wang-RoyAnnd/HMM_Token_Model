last november, i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival. i have to say that it was a lot of fun. a few tech errors aside, it was a great experience. i loved the writing and acting, especially from the guy that played the lead role. there is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of wit to. i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed real nice. all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience, and one i'd definitely recommend. the story was entertaining and cool, as a woman i've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, and i could really understand his problems because of it. the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with. the friends in the movie are really well written to, they are realistic. i know people like these, i only wish imy friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk. the whole movie is just real cool, i wish there were more films out there like it.<br /><br />- jayden
