though the story is essentially routine, and the "surprise" ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine, and shine they do. the film is impeccably made - for its time. it was remade in 2000 as "under suspicion" and if you only want to see one version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), i recommend the latter one, with hopkins' up-to-date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at. the ending, however, still blows.
