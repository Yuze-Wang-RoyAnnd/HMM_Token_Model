i'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars.<br /><br />but they just don't understand the movie.<br /><br />the story is about growing up in a difficult situation.<br /><br />there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren.<br /><br />and there's good reason why so many critics like this movie.<br /><br />and the reason is because they understand the movie.<br /><br />i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people.<br /><br />i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write 10 lines.<br /><br />i frankly don't have anything else to say.
