i am shocked. shocked and dismayed that the 428 of you imdb users who voted before me have not given this film a rating of higher than 7. 7?!?? - that's a c!. if i could give fobh a 20, i'd gladly do it. this film ranks high atop the pantheon of modern comedy, alongside half baked and mallrats, as one of the most hilarious films of all time. if you know _anything_ about rap music - you must see this!! if you know nothing about rap music - learn something!, and then see this! comparisons to 'spinal tap' fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film. if you liked bob roberts, you'll love this. watch it and vote it a 10!
