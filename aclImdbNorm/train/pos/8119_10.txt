i think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed, with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax. what cinema goers made of this in the 30s, i can only imagine. the 'times' said at the time, 'a miracle has come to the screen.' watch it and marvel.
