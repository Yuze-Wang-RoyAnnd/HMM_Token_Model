telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica! i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica! it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil. the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful. xica contains a lot of history of that time period. i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning. i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo. i've e-mailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears. the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch xica. overall xica merits a 10 out of 10!
