i don't have words to describe how good this movie is. only a genius like amrita pritam could have written such a real depiction of the days of partition. the movie kept haunting me for many days.<br /><br />urmila did the role of her life in this movie. she put life in the role of puroo and manoj vajpai did no less in his role as rashid. it is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of puroo and rashid. the punjabi costumes looked so natural on urmila and manoj looked like a natural punjabi mussalmaan.<br /><br />sandhali sinha as lajjo and suri as ramchand did fabulous job. priyanshu chattarjee did good work as triloki.<br /><br />some of the scenes you just can't get out of your mind. when puroo meets lajjo for the first time, it brings tears to your eyes. the climax is just killer. i was expecting a tragic ending but thankfully, the ending was wonderful.<br /><br />this movie is in the same category as pakeezah, mughal-e-azam, banaras etc. not to be missed.
