i must have been only 11 when mr peepers started. it was a must see for the whole family, i believe on sun. nights. repeating gags were rob opening his locker (he had to use a yardstick or pointer to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things, finally kicking the spot whereupon his door would open), and taking pins out of a new shirt(at the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt, timing was everything and the pins got lots of laughs.) i remember an aunt that drove a rio like jack benny and always wanted "sonny" to say something scientific. he would think and come up with "semi permeable membrane" or osmosis causing her to say how brilliant he was. (you had to have been there). marion lorne stole the show every time she was on screen. why they didn't continue the series from her pov when wally quit (he was afraid he was being typecast but by then it was way too late)i'll never know. i saw somewhere that the 1st tv wedding (big one anyway) was tiny tim on the carson show. horsecocky. it was rob and nancy (did i ever have the hots for her) and i remember it made the cover of tv guide and got press in all the papers and major magazines. a trip to the museum of broadcasting in nyc years ago was disappointing in that they had very few episodes then and those might be gone now. i still remember it as wonderful and wish i had been a little older.
