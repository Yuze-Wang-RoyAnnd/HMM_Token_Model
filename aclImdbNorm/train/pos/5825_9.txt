most stoogephiles consider this to be the best stooges short bar none, and they're right. curly is a scream dressed up in drag as "senorita cucaracha", and moe and larry are in top form as "senor mucho" and "senor gusto", respectively. christine mcintyre's beautiful operatic voice is given full rein--she actually was a trained opera singer--and it's wonderful. the great gino corrado is hilarious as a pompous italian singer terrorized by the stooges at a society party. some truly funny gags, good direction and very tight editing make this rise to the very top of the stooges' prolific output. what's even more amazing is that curly was having severe health problems at the time, and in several of the shorts he made during this period, you can see that he is obviously ill; his timing is way off, he speaks very slowly and haltingly, and has trouble getting around. fortunately, his health was in an upswing when he made this film, and it shows. classic stooge comedy, and enjoyed by even non-stooge fans (i had a girlfriend who couldn't stand the stooges, but even she laughed at this one). a must-see.
