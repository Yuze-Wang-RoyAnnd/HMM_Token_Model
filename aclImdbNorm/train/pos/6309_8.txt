i saw this gem of a film at cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight.<br /><br />welcome to collinwood is nothing short of superb. great fun throughout, with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off. it's a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook (cosimo, played by luis guzman) who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. while in prison he meets a `lifer' who tells him of `the ultimate bellini'
