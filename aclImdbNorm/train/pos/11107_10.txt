the sopranos (now preparing to end) is the very peak of adult television and drama. when the sopranos hits the mark, it really hits the mark. using great writing and great actors (most of them being extras from goodfellas) the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way. heading up the cast is james gandolfini, who for all intensive purposes is tony soprano, and edie falco, who certainly holds her own. the series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary (usually violence and foul language). tony sirico, michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting. seasonal extras are also worth note including names like steve buscemi (great!), joe pantoliano (great!), david proval (good), robert patrick, robert loggia and frank vincent.<br /><br />the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique tv. symbolism and simple story lines, dreams and shoot-outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect hbo package. watch it...
