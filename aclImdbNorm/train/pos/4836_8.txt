i have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take (because of its length and story), i liked it very much. i was impressed first, by the script and then, by the realization of this script. the film takes you on a ride, but that is not an easy, joyful ride; it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary people's lives. what i loved was the inner logic the film followed; logic, which just like logic in life, was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end, when i thought about it, all the events and twists made sense. it makes no sense though to try to re-tell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time. i also liked very much nikita mikhalkov's character aleksei and the way he played it, as some critics would saw, with restless abandon. what i didn't like about it, was that i think he later played characters that remind me of aleksei in films like "cruel romance" (zhestokij romans, which i actually love) and to some extent in "the insulted and the injured" ("unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "sibiriada" shows, i think, what a great film-maker andrei konchalovski was before he went to hollywood and made forgettable films like "tango and cash" and less forgettable like "runaway train". i would prefer "kurochka ryaba" to them...
