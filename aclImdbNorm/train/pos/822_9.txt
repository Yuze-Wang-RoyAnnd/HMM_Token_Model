the last film in lucas' saga is a lavish, spectacular-looking production. it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but i think it is a notch above episode iv (and just a notch below episodes iii and v). in fact, i think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga. as far as i'm concerned, it is still a grandiosely entertaining film. it is not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to lucas' universe. there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. also, it is a lot of fun. new characters are introduced and old ones face new, unexpected challenges. c3po and r2d2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and luke is still a great character to identify with. again, it is luke's (and vader's) inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone. lucas' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly. i'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii, viii and ix, because this film is a great bookend to a long, fascinating and captivating saga. not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matin'ee style.
