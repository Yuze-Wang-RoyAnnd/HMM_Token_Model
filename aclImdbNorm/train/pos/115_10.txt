piece of subtle art. maybe a masterpiece. doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world. the life is, in this film, only exercise of adaptation. lesson about limits and original sin, about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways.<br /><br />leopold kessle is another joseph k. images of trial and same ambiguous woman. and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.<br /><br />methaphor or parable, the movie is history of disappointed's evolution. war, peace, business or lie are only details of gelatin-time. hypocrisy is a mask. love- a convention. the sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality.
