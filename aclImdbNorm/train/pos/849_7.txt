the matador is a strange film. its main character julian, played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by brosnan, is not your typical hero. julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises. having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely. and so, after a chance meeting at a bar with danny (greg kinnear), he latches on and begins a halting, awkward friendship. danny, the quintessential nice guy, is dealing with some stuff in his own life and, truth be told, could use a friend as well. the two make an unexpected connection, and danny sticks around to hear julian's story, even after learning the "unsavory" truth about julian's work.<br /><br />matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema, the anti-hero assassin (films like 'assassins' and 'grosse pointe blank' come to mind). but matador differs in several key ways. first of all, the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail, meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you. and second, unlike most anti-hero films, matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character. julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing. this is unusual, given that 99.99% of us would consider killing for money horrific. and yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic. although we don't like to admit it, almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough, maybe even murder. did julian's victims deserve to die? who is paying to have people killed? who knows. the movie never deals with these questions. the focus is on julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship. if you read about someone like julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer, but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity. sympathy for the devil, i guess.<br /><br />brosnan's take on julian is well done and deeply unsettling. he doesn't completely divorce himself from his james bond good looks and smooth charm, but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix. weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance. it keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him. it's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays, but it works. the films only other major role, that of danny, is not nearly as meaty. kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problems.<br /><br />the film doesn't really have any huge shocks or m night shyamalan twists, but i wasn't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying. it doesn't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human. and it didn't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet i thought the pacing was well done and i was never bored. maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another, and how those needs have no moral prerequisites. even a murderer needs friends, and even good people can be friends with bad people. it's a comment on the strange, random world we live in. a good film; worth seeing.
