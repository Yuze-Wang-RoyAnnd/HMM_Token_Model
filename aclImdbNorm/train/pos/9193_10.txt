it holds very true to the original manga of the same name, aka (tramps like us in the u.s) but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read the manga. it's a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else. however, because of her outward strength, she fears showing her inner feelings and thus let's those around her hurt her with their blunt comments. the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pet...human...momo. if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful j-dorama (japanese drama) actors/resses then this is definitely the series to watch...and read!
