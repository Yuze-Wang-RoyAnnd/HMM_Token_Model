given its time of release, the story that unravels in 1950 thriller 'panic in the streets' was hardly a surprise. the corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague. yet with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers. the cast and crew are flawless. richard widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in 'night and the city,' jack palance in his chilling film debut, also starring in this film are paul douglas and a young (and rather cute) barbara bel geddes. a whole slew of uncredited, non-professional actors (typical of director kazan) fill in the remaining slots. elia kazan directs, joe macdonald films (he would later work with richard widmark again in 1953's much superior 'pickup on south street') and the great alfred newman scores it. nearly everyone involved here has done better work, 'panic in the streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless. especially for the film-noir enthusiast.
