not that many films have truly exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have. those in the profession have some genuinely intimidating looking instruments. give writers dennis paoli, stuart gordon, and charles finch for deriving maximum make-you- squirm-in-your-seat shock value from their premise.<br /><br />corbin bernsen, in a nicely nuanced performance, is alan feinstone, dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the tracks early on. an unbalanced obsessive-compulsive, he starts dwelling on thoughts of decay, even imagining it where there isn't any, and also equating decay with corruption of society in general. having witnessed his unfaithful wife brooke (linda hoffman) getting it on with their pool boy, he determines to punish her. at the same time, he's under pressure from a smarmy i.r.s. agent (earl boen, best known as dr. silberman from the "terminator" franchise) to do a favor in exchange for the agent keeping his mouth shut about feinstone's financial affairs. feinstone starts to perceive everybody around him as decayed in one way or another, and he goes on a murder spree as police detective gibbs (the always welcome ken foree) picks up his trail.<br /><br />director brian yuzna clearly has great fun with the script. it allows for some genuinely nasty and remarkably entertaining gore scenes that do just as well as creating sympathy for the victims as thrilling the audience. the script gives the feinstone character some fine lines of dialog and is overall quite sly and amusing, with large doses of pitch-black humor (such as feinstone ordering a victim to "get their tongue out of the way!"). brooke and the i.r.s. agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes. the makeup effects are for the most part quite good. and the film does a fine job of maintaining its forward momentum, as feinstone, with his relentless drive for perfection, switches from respected professional to unhinged killer in record time.<br /><br />foree, always cool and fun to watch, is rather wasted in a standard-issue detective role, but there's some enjoyment in watching boen play his slimeball part to the hilt. hoffman and christa sauls provide very appealing eye candy. and a pre-fame mark ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role. but this is all very much bernsen's show as he sinks his teeth (pardon me for using that expression) into his plum leading part with total conviction.<br /><br />"the dentist" ranks as one of the more original and interesting horror films to come out of the 1990's.<br /><br />8/10
