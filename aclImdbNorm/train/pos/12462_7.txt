noni hazlehurst's tour-de-force performance (which won her an afi award) is at least on par with her effort in fran three years later. colin friels is also good, and, for those who are interested, alice garner appears as noni's child, and michael caton (best known for the castle) is a bearded painter. (also interestingly, hazlehurst is currently the host of lifestyle program better homes and gardens, and caton is the host of property-type programs including hot property, hot auction, etc...) this film reaffirms the popularly-held belief that noni was arguably australia's top female actor during the early-to-mid 1980s. rating: 79/100.
