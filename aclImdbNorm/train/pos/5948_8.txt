some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither mark twain nor rodgers and hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either. you'll look a long time to find a greater rodgers and hart fan than me but burke and van heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great songs - but beautiful, moonlight becomes you, it's always you, the day after forever, etc - to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad, once and for always, plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entries in if you stub your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing. the flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously - why else make merlin a heavy when in most, if not all, of the other versions he is more a friend/mentor to arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why sir lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie. on balance it does what it sets out to do, entertain, so good luck to it.
