kurt russell is elvis, plain and simple. his dedication to this role resulted in what i think, is the best movie bio ever. if you're an elvis fan, see it if you can.<br /><br />the made-for-television film was made two years after elvis' death.<br /><br />one piece of advice, there are two versions - one at 180 minutes and one at 117 minutes. the only one to watch is the longer one. the shorter one has more than one hour of footage edited out. it just does not work because the scenes in it are often dependent on the scenes that were cut.<br /><br />this masterpiece takes you from elvis childhood through his emergence as entertainment's greatest star. shelley winters and bing russell (kurt's real dad) are excellent as elvis' parents. and pat hingle delivers a very competent col. tom parker.<br /><br />long live the king!
