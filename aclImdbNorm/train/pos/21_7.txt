this may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill.<br /><br />the story revolves around iris, a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job, an illiterate cafeteria worker named stanley. iris discovers that stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. of course, as you might predict, the two, although initially wary of involvement, develop feelings for each other...<br /><br />jane fonda competently plays iris, a woman with problems of her own, coping with a job lacking prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. however, robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect. they aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in on screen romances, but an ordinary working class, middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles.<br /><br />i won't give the ending away, but it's a lovely, heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.
