watched this french horror film last night and pretty much liked it. the whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. as they look through the diary, they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom. what they find out, is something completely different, and horrifying to say the least. i like low-budget horror films, that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way, and tell a good story. this movie does just that, despite taking a while to get going. the result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me, and i enjoyed the ride. not a lot of gore, but that wouldn't fit the story, although the gore it has is pretty good.
