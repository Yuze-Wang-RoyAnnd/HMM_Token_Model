greetings again from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights. a very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer. we are so accustomed to character development over a 2 hour movie, it is a bit disarming for that to occur in an 8 minute segment.<br /><br />the idea is 18 love/relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods of this magnificent city. of course, some stand up better than others and some go for comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotion. some very known directors are involved, including: the coen brothers, wes craven, alfonso cuaron, alexander payne, gus van sant and gurinda chadha. many familiar faces make appearances as well: steve buscemi, barbet schroeder, catalina sandino moreno, ben gazzara, gena rowlands, gerard depardieu, juliette binoche, willem dafoe, nick nolte, maggie gyllenhaal and bob hoskins.<br /><br />one of the best segments involves a mime, and then another mime and the nerdy, yet happy young son of the two mimes. also playing key roles are a red trench coat, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child and many other topics. don't miss alexander payne (director of "sideways") as oscar wilde.<br /><br />the diversity of the segments make this interesting to watch, but as a film, it cannot be termed great. still it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for the frequent movie goer.
