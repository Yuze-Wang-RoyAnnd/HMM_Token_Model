if the australian post office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment then this is it.this is one of those movies who's heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again. miranda's performance is touching as it shows an aspect of australia unimagined by many europeans, in that it can be cold, wet and bleak, just like anywhere else and just like anywhere else what is important is the people that surrounds you. the characters in the movie are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career move into a 'dead letter office' a thought to be considered. miranda has gone on to do bigger movies, but i hope she always keeps a thought inside for this one?.
