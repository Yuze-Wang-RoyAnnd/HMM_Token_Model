i watched this film sort of by accident, having bought it as the b side on the omega man dvd. the omega man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 days later, the rest of it is just the stuff of tv movies. but soylent green is in a whole other league. i bet this is one of tarantino's favourites. there are at least 3 scenes in the film that i've never seen anything like before. heston casually getting into bed with the "furniture" while discussing something else completely unrelated! a whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! a priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this. and what the heck is going on between heston and edward g. robinson? is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? luckily, i saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. then i watched it again, and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. a very nice script - and some great sets too. just when you thought you'd seen everything . . .
