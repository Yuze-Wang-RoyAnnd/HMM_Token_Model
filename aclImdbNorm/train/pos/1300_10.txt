i first saw a track from this dvd at a hifi show nov 2006 in london ( i was not really into cream until now!!).it was through a high end arcam system,it sounded great with dts.i had to get this dvd and i'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music dvd i have ever watched.the performance of cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music dvd.it does not matter what type of music you like,this one will definitely grow on you.it's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again.even new musicians don't cut the mustard these days, as these old rockers do.
