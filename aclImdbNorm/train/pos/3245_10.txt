i like this film for several reasons. i have a soft spot for films about intricately plotted criminal plots like topkapi. i also enjoy films (like topkapi and big deal on madonna street) that spoof the the genre. one of the best ones is disorganized crime.<br /><br />corbin bernsen has met four cons over the years, and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small montana town. but he hasn't given any details on the crime to the fellows, nor do they really know each other at all. shortly after he sends for them bernsen is arrested by two new jersey policemen (ed o'neill and daniel roebuck) whom he escaped from before and have a warrant to bring him back. while he is in their custody the four cons (fred gwynne, lou diamond philips, ruben blades, and will russ) show up without a clue about why they are there except that bernsen was planning something. <br /><br />the first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other, with gwynne and philips managing to push away their own suspicions to figure out they have to trust each other. at the same time we see bernsen patiently waiting for the right moment to escape from o'neill and roebuck again - not too difficult as they are not the brightest bulbs who ever existed. the result are two sets of plots that will keep juxtaposing against each other throughout the film: the four cons trying to figure out what bernsen's scheme was, and how to put it into operation, and bernsen trying to maintain his own freedom from his pursuers and regain his cabin (and hopefully find his gang there for him to take command of). there is also a third, smaller, plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local sheriff hoyt axton against the idiots from new jersey who keep getting into his hair.<br /><br />there are many delightful moments in the film, such as axton, egged on by o'neil and roebuck, into surrounding a house in the town that bernsen is supposed to be hiding inside of, and yelling (through a megaphone, "come out, we have you surrounded!!", only to have the scene switch to a huge, montana plain that bernsen is struggling and stumbling through miles from where the police think he is at that moment. there are moments of misadventures by our four cons, who fortunately put the oldest (gwynne) into leadership position. this does not always guarantee anything. at one point their car won't start, and they have to thumb a ride by truck. unfortunately it is a truck carrying manure.<br /><br />the conclusion with the gang successfully carrying out the robbery, including disabling all the police cars at the critical time (philips specialty is cars) is also a gem of timing, suspense, and comic results. the film is very entertaining, and certainly worth watching.
