the movie "frailty" is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film. it has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not. "frailty" is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong.<br /><br />in "frailty", a middle-aged father (bill paxton) and his two sons claim to be doing the work of god. it turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called "god's hands". we watch the father kill the "demons" in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work god and that what they are doing is right. he claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth. god has given him a list of names and in return for his "services"; he and his sons will be given protection, which basically means the police will never be able to capture them. we see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner. but what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons, particularly the oldest son, adam. adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being, that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that. he knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother, fenton. fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything in as if it were his own religion. he seems trapped in his father's world of god and demons. i suppose this is because he's so young and easily impressionable. but everything that happens to these three is rather convincing, in fact, too convincing. <br /><br />the events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters. i say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see god. dad first sees the murders as his mission. his "mission" eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons. in fact, his hallucination is the primary one. his "orders" and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination. watch the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where i am coming from. fenton, the younger son, is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction. since he is so young, it's easy for him to fall into his father's trap. adam, on the other is very skeptical towards his father's actions. <br /><br />***spoilers*** <br /><br />in a way, the hallucination ends when dad is killed towards the end of the movie. (i will not say how or under what circumstances). but i will say that it is not pleasant. after his death, it fast-forwards to the present day. (the story is being told through flashbacks, as seen through the eyes of the oldest son adam). in actuality, it is fenton that is telling the story, not adam as originally believed. the story is being told the way he perceived it, through his actions and his brother's actions. fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the fbi agent into his trap.<br /><br />since religion is a major theme in this movie, the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it. before dad discovered his newfound mission, he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being. his sons fenton and adam often sang innocent little children's church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant. after the revelation of dad's newfound mission, they both took off in separate directions - adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness. <br /><br />a very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you, do not watch it alone.
