i have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes, i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me. notwithstanding this is not a "movie with a plot", its about real guys and some of the "problems" that they face. i found the movie hilarious(especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other). simply put, if you are in the same "wave-length" as these people, you will find this movie amazing. i don't think that this is going win any golden globes or oscars, or that the people in this movie will become future hollywood stars, but its a kind of "cult-classic" among young people who could relate to their experience. for me the guy that stands out the most is hans: the scandinavian guy,who ,according to him "isnt a looker", but gets all(or some) of the chicks. the "little-people" also play a big part in the movie, especially when they are drunk. if i keep going, i might provide a spoiler and i don't want to do that, just go and get the movie and you will not regret. i give it a 8/10
