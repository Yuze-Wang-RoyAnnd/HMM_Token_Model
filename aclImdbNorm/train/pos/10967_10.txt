i first saw this movie in my plays & playwrights course at tulane. i was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was. it is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude. the family is fascinating and i thought it really showed little edie at her core. **as a side note my professor even told me that throughout the filming, little edie became infatuated with one of the camera men.** the beauty, i find, comes from the naturalness of the family's dysfunction. it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for little edie's rehabilitation to society. in all, the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it's portrayal of surprising beauty. two thumbs way up!
