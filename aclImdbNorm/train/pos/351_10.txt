it's a colorful slasher movie. that's about it.<br /><br />it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies, but i never care for such things. figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway.<br /><br />the death scenes were inventive and gorey, bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th. <br /><br />another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl, unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious. <br /><br />people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie. as simple as that. i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same. <br /><br />--mb
