i wouldn't dare say this film is better than the original, but it is very good in it's own right. the comedy in this film is just as good as the original though, there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them.<br /><br />the story in this film is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what makes it so great. peter hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast. the core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles. i don't care what anyone says, i think keanu reeves is a great actor! i really enjoyed his portrayal of ted in both of these films as i did alex winter's bill. i was very happy to see george carlin returning to the role of rufus, very cool! hal london jr, who plays the part of ted logan's father does a really good job. the scene where ted possesses his fathers body and hal london jr begins acting like ted is a great scene, and he pulls it off impressively well. i can't forget to mention william sadler as death, he completely made the movie for me. the rest of the cast is quite good as well.<br /><br />if you liked the first installment of the bill and ted series, then i would hope you would like this film as well. but, don't expect it to be as good as the original. i really hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,<br /><br />-chris
