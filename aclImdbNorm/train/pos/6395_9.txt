for me,this is one of the best movies i ever saw.overcoming racism,struggling through life and proving himself he isn't just an ordinary "cookie" ,carl brashear is an amazing character to play ,who puts cuba in his best light,best performance in his life.de niro,who is a living legend gives that something to the movie.hated his character in movie,but he gives so much good acting to this film,great performance.and appearance of beautiful charlize was and as always is a big plus for every movie. so if you haven't seen this movie i highly recommended for those who love bravery,greatness who seek inspiration.you must look this great drama. my vote 9/10.
