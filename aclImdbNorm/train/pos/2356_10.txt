pushing daisies was a wonderful show. much like dead like me and wonderfalls, you can tell was created by bryan fuller. i can understand how people who don't have much of a love for theater, cinema, musicals and the like would be annoyed. this is not a typical television program and the fantastic is too much for some. these people seem to need some a little more linear and muted tone to keep them happy. this program explodes with color, winks at old movie scenes, hums with incredible music and talented performances. there is nothing random about the choices that are made from costume to leitmotif. the story takes many twists and turns but all very accessible because the conversations are about love, honesty, courage, loss and so many other things we face every day. the only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show and that was rushed because pushing daisies was canceled. don't approach this as a typical tv show. think of it as an evening at the theater, then sit back and enjoy!
