in the white balloon and crimson gold, the two other films by jafar panahi that i've seen, the director mines surprising amounts of depth in subjects that seem, on the surface, slight. in offside, panahi's seriocomic tribute to iranian women standing up for their rights, i don't think he's as successful. not that what he's saying isn't important, of course (and it's too bad that, like pretty much every other panahi film, iranians can't see it). but, after a while, the film feels a tad flat, and it feels long even at 90 minutes. not saying i didn't like it, though. the actors are all fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious. but it's not an important work, in my opinion.
