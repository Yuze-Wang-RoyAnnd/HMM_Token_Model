this is a very funny movie! i have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not. however, i do think men all over the world can identify with "frank" and his thoughts to some extent! these thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie i'm sure!<br /><br />all cast members perform well, and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in england or the us. but for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand swedish, you are in for a treat!<br /><br />highly recommended.
