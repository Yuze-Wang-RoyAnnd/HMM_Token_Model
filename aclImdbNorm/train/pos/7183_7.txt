this is a perfect series for family viewing. we gather around the tv to watch this on bbc america. it is an up-to-date version of robin hood and it appeals to children and adults alike. our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching robin's next exploits. we can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free "on demand" viewing.<br /><br />the wardrobe has a spot of current fashion. there is a moral to each story. it is entertaining. the violence is not over-the-top or needless. the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a john william's feel to it. it is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair.<br /><br />there is so much garbage on television from brain rotting "reality" tv to senseless violence. you should take this for what it is and that is an updated "robin hood" not to be compared with the movie exploits of errol flynn. this is a gem to be enjoyed by all. parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. he is a robin hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight. maid marian is also an appealing role model for young girls. rather than stand by and do nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the "night watchman." the sheriff of nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked, just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between billy joel and tim curry. guy gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor, one that makes most women wish he didn't have portray the role of a bad "guy". <br /><br />the only question we have is "where is friar tuck?"
