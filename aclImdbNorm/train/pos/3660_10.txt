this obscure de sica delivers the goods. and it is said "the meek shall inherit the earth." this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war. they are homeless but cheerful, in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them, footmats for the italian carpetbaggers. de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a cinderella story. i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio. it begins with the words, "once upon a time..." to exemplify the timelessness of its tale, for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all. de sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best. abandoning neo-realism, he always dallied between that and pure good old film-making, he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world. gracias vittorio! gracias! gracias!!! gracias!!!!!!!!!!!!
