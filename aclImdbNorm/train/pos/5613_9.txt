i'm a pretty old dude, old enough to remember the taste of oreos and coke as they were 50-55 years ago, when every taste for a kid was fresh. i wish i have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker, so that i could taste those things today. this magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how i've drifted, physically and otherwise, a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations. over the half century, they would have had to adjust quite a bit, because you see i would have known that i set them aside. eating one now would be a celebration of self and past, and story, and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward.<br /><br />i didn't have enough sense to do that with original coke. and i couldn't have invented one of those magical psychic lockers
