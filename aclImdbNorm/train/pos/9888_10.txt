although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is in fact nothing of the sort. it is a political and cultural allegory of mexico's post-columbian odyssey, as even a passing glance at mexico's history will attest. <br /><br />in contrast to "like water for chocolate," "erendira" expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work. (a good starting point is to see the grandmother character as spain: proud, aloof, sorrowful and, above all else, weighed-down-with-history.)<br /><br />the ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the "outcome" of history (i.e. the present) is always obscure, since we are too close to it for honest evaluation. refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director, given the ambitions of the film.<br /><br />"erendira" is gorgeous. a big-screen experience would be ideal, if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening. but if not, vhs is better than never seeing it at all.
