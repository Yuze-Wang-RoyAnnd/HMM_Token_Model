if you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor, then you will enjoy this flick.<br /><br />i don't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this one. take it for what it is: a vehicle for dennis hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh. it ain't shakespeare, but it is well done. ericka eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one - better than any episode of baywatch - and shows a knack for subtle humor. too bad she hasn't had many opportunities to expand on that.<br /><br />tom berenger fits his role of "real navy" perfectly and william mcnamara does a solid job as a hustler.<br /><br />throw in a walk-on by hopper in the middle of the chase for "the cherry on this sundae" and you've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing. i bought this one as soon as it was available.<br /><br />brain-candy.
