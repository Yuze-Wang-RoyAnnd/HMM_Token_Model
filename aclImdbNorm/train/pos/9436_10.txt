"it's all up to you, ed?" "now you get to play the game." the day my father left my mother, he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend, on opening day at the cinerama dome in hollywood. i was but fourteen years old. i wasn't even entirely sure what i was seeing, but i will never forgot it, especially the scene with ned beatty.<br /><br />watching it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me quivers.<br /><br />my father was a huge burt reynolds fan, hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie.' i had seen two films at the dome prior to this: "grand prix" and "the song of norway." well this wasn't exactly mario andretti or the brady bunch. after leaving the theater, i was shell-shocked.<br /><br />but even at that tender age, i appreciated the artistry...and after seeing again today, am i surprised i was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing, yet extremely well-crafted film.<br /><br />suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year-old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend. i don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit much for a child to witness.<br /><br />as an adult, i still find it quite disturbing, yet i am still very impressed with the quality of the film-making.<br /><br />burt reynolds as an absolute wonder, as are all the principles...from billy redden as the inbred guitar wonder, to ronny cox as the terrified insurance salesman...everyone does an admirable job. the sound quality is second to none, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks. the photography, cinematography...all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate.<br /><br />the moral questions raised, from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being, remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released. and the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-altering. these four men, city men, suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined, raise the bar from action to horror.<br /><br />it's a classic to be sure. and the phrase "you have a pretty mouth" has been quoted endlessly, from saturday night live to off-the-cuff comments around water-cooler at work, this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture...as much as "make my day" or "i'll be back" ever were.<br /><br />so what would you do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city, cozy bed, wife and kids? and if you took the measures burt reynolds did (and i would have done the same) would you bury the body beneath the soon-to-be-lake, or stand trial and take your chances? the bottom line is: deliverance delivers. you can take that to the bank. if this movie doesn't get under your skin, then you are not human.<br /><br />even if you have seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the above question.<br /><br />my favorite part of the film remains the same: ed failing to kill the deer...then changing. life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man. and i suppose that's what this film is all about jon voight, in particular, as ed, gives the best performance here. and he remains one of the more gifted actors in hollywood history, from midnight cowboy to his highly underrated performance as franklin d. roosevelt in pearl harbor, his acting lifts the movie to another level. climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to make it right it needs to be seen to be believed. i guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level.<br /><br />briskly paced, tense, taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string, this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today. times have changes, but our choices as human beings have not.<br /><br />ten out of ten stars.
