louis creed, a doctor from chicago, moves to a large house near a small town, since he is going to be giving classes in the university of maine's. along with him, is his wife rachel and their two kids, ellie and gage,as well as ellie's cat, church. soon, they met their new neighbor,and old man named judd crandall.judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house(that is constantly a way used by big trucks) but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house. judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery, but rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children, since she has traumas from her sister zelda's death.<br /><br />during the first week of the family in the new house, louis already has dead people to deal with: victor pascow, a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident, addresses his dying words to louis personally, even though the two men are strangers. on the night following pascow's death, louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets pascow, who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not "go beyond, no matter how much you feel you need to." louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream, until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles. anyway, he dismisses the dream. many strange things starts to happen and church, ellie's cat, dies while walking on the highway. louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about church's death with ellie, but judd, sympathizing with him, jud takes louis to the pet cemetery, supposedly to bury church. but instead of stopping there, jud leads louis farther on a frightening journey to "the real cemetery": an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmac ('...indians...'). there louis buries the cat on jud's instruction, with jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life. and that is where the real horror story begins...<br /><br />i personally find this movie very good. it's not the most horrifying of all, but it is one of the best horror movies i watched. the way gage dies, is almost impossible to not stay in your memory, specially being a toddler. it's cool to see stephen king's cameo as the minister of the funeral.<br /><br />of course, there are some script errors: how can a rich doctor with two small kids, goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house? how gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck? why louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters? things like that doesn't make any sense, but i can understand that all horror's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work.<br /><br />a good thing i saw in this movie, is the necessity to talk about death with the children, no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist, and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything. because of louis being afraid to be honest with ellie, confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again, all the nightmare began.
