while the story is sweet, and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music (gershwin), the engaging beauty of french impressionistic art, kelly's enthralling choreography (including his rapturous "pas de deux d'amour", really a separate genre), with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set. matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist.
