i am afraid it was a movie that you have to actually watch to get anything out of it.i t is not a mindless movie like ....."leathal weapon part 58" you know the one where riggs is really crazy? it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning. you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any way.i have noticed in the past that most people that do not like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because .....duh they don't get it or understand it or what happened.<br /><br />don't let your doggy take a shower!!!
