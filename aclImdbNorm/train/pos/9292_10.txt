if you like film, don't miss this one. if you prefer action, or horror, or romance, then you'll wonder what's happening. everyone here is stuck in a gangster film. and what happens is transcendental murder.<br /><br />there are few similar films. no doubt it will see limited release, and be hard to find. but the search will be worth it. if you want to study a mileu as a potential symbol, then this is indeed a film to study.<br /><br />you can't watch it once. if you do you'll never see what's happening. dark city is better. joe vrs. the volcano is more fun. but mad dog time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism. . .or at least to think twice before shooting again.
