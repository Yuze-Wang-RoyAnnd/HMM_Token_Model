the tattooed stranger was another of those rare b-movies that bbc2 screened over christmas/new year 2005-2006. see also they live by night and the brighton strangler.<br /><br />in this one, a man walking his dog in central park comes across an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside. she was shot and police then try to identify her with only a tattoo as the main clue. after being identified, the murderer is discovered and is shot in the shootout at the end.<br /><br />most of this movie was shot on location in and around new york, so we get to see some areas of the city we don't normally see, especially the back streets.<br /><br />mostly unknowns are in the cast, with john miles getting top billing.<br /><br />the tattooed stranger is worth seeking out. excellent but rather obscure.<br /><br />rating: 3 stars out of 5.
