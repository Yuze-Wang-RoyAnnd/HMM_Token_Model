this showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5; i gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. after reading the viewer comments, i was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy. yeah, i see that imdb lists it as comedy/drama under genre. that sure is misleading, isn't it? fortunately, i saw the movie before logging onto this website so i did not have that expectation. in fact, based on the synopsis of what i heard, i fully expected it to simply be a drama. i'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes.<br /><br />another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character-driven'. 'driving miss daisy' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind. someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial. tom's (danny glover) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie. that is, how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops, if you will. however, they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to greenwich and move 'up' in the world.<br /><br />tom's obsession became a compulsion. he proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood. his chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color. it was because of everything the 'interloper' represented; everything that tom had left behind. in essence, tom had become an oreo cookie: black on the outside but white on the inside.<br /><br />the last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written, directed and acted (by whoopi goldberg) i have ever had the pleasure to witness. i realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door (don't want to give it away). the climax is verbal and whoopi delivers it. i am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs tom which college tom -two is going to or when she releases it, all in the middle of the night and tom wakes up. nevertheless, the denouement is great. you know that life on that street will never be the same.<br /><br />my favorite kind of character-driven flick: people go through problems, some pain, do their dance, they grow, they change, and life goes on. as an audience member, i may learn something or be inspired.
