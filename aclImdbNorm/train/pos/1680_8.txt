well made and stylish while still ultimately making sense this thriller would work better for non giallo fans to get interested in the genre than the later argento entries which go overboard in all directions.<br /><br />for fans of these crazed italian thrillers, they will appreciate george hilton and the turns his character takes and what he's put through. the camera-work is fresh with dashes of graphic violence and odd, but appropriate choices and a good not overblown music score as well. the less you know about the story the better to make it work.<br /><br />the only thing lacking in keeping this from being a great sergio martino directed giallo is that the story doesn't have that extra sexual or psychological, or both element to put it over the top. it's more a routine mystery, the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and flaws.<br /><br />the recent dvd (2005) release is beautiful looking and definitely the way to see the film, unless these ever get art house screenings which seems unlikely.
