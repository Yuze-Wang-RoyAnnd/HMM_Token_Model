`an itch in time' is one of a string of home runs bob clampett hit for wb in the early 1940s, including `horton hatches the egg' and `tortoise wins by a hare.' soaked in manic timing and exaggerated mayhem, it's basically the saga of a flea who's busy breaking ground for a new home, and the dog whose ground is being broken. because master elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath if he so much as scratches, the unlucky canine is forced to endure an upward spiral of torment as the homesteading flea uses pick-axes and power tools to clear the `land.' ultimately, the little monster lights the fuse to a small mountain of high explosives he's piled onto his victim's backside! there's a tremendous explosion, and the hapless pooch covers his eyes as his rear end erupts in a blazing fourth of july display! that really has to hurt, and the dog takes flight, but soon he stops the action and says with a merry smile, `you guys better cut it out, 'cause i think i'm starting to like it!' for years this kinky confession was censored, but current prints have restored the clip, so now viewers can enjoy it in its original devilish glory. still cut, however, is the closing gag in which the cat blows his brains out after he laments, `now i've seen everything!' this was a common gag at wb, but it has since been purged from this cartoon and several others, including `horton.'
