this film is so old i never realized how young looking ray milland looked in 1936, i remember him playing in a great film, "lost weekend". ray plays the role of michael stuart, who is a very rich banker. there are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy. they hire a man to pose as a very rich count, his name is count ariszted, (misha auer) who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture. deanna durbin, (penny craig) surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice i have every heard, the entire police department and convicts started applauding, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film. this is deanna durbin's first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with universal studios after leaving mgm.
