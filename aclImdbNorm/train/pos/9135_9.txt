i don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets, this movie rocks! excellent movie, has it all, great music(prince of coarse!), romance, and drama.<br /><br />this is really a very sad movie, very moving. i don't want to say to much more, i;m not into giving away the plot, but i will say this-the film is very realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film. i see this as being very realistic and being so real, makes the movie that much more moving. my generation loved this movie growing up, so many of us loved prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems.<br /><br />that said, it's definetly not just a movie for teens, id recomend it to all age groups. and it's not all so dark, the movie has some great music, band performance scenes, and sexy fun scenes between prince and appelonia.
