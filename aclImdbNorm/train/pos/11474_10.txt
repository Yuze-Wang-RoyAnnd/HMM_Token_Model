this movie is one for the ages. first, i have to say after seeing this once, it became one of my all-time favorite movies. why? simple; ben coccio (writer, director)has put together a true piece of art. where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, director ben coccio gives us truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. the mainstream media spins and spins but ben coccio looks school shootings right in the face, able to go where no other form of media has ever gone before, into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. while it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? the gloves come off, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened. sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, we are shown that these boys are us and we them. society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.<br /><br />respect and love your fellow man. a lesson we all should learn, thank you so much for making this film mr. coccio, i hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film-making career.
