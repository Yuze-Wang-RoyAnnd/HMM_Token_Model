before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched. as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed, i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed. except asia carrera's sexual scene, any sexual scene in this movie doesn't make me feel great (you know what i mean). the great jenna jameson doesn't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of. felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned.<br /><br />although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor, this movie is very good. if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies. story, acting, direction, sets, makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great. the actors of this movie done really good acting, they all done a great job. dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies.
