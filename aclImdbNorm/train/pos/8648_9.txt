kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. a journey on the darkest road ever. the road of no return. the plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in california. the man (david duchovny in his best role up to now) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in america and his girl - who is a photographer - is going to take the pictures. so they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way. to share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad. but the couple that answers it is not just any couple. it is one of the strangest couples ever. the girl is a naive, frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses. the man is exactly the opposite. a cruel ruthless murderer. we learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to kalifornia (not with c as usual, but with k, presumably symbolizing the word killer), along his journey of betrayal, murder and finally defeat. all the leads, duchovny, pitt, lewis and forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star. the photography is amazing, with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie, and the music suits the dark character of the film. on the whole this is a really good movie. don't miss it. you'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with!
