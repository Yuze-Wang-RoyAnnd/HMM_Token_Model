finally, timon and pumbaa in their own film...<br /><br />'the lion king 1 1/2: hakuna matata' is an irreverent new take on a classic tale. which classic tale, you ask? why, 'the lion king' of course!<br /><br />yep, if there's one thing that disney is never short of, it's narcissism.<br /><br />but that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film. it's basically the events of 'the lion king' as told from timon and pumbaa's perspective. and it's because of this that you'll have to know the story of 'the lion king' by heart to see where they're coming from.<br /><br />anyway, at one level i was watching this and thinking "oh my god this is so lame..." and on another level i was having a ball. much of the humour is predictable - i mean, when pumbaa makes up two beds, a big one for himself and a small one for timon, within the first nanosecond we all know that timon is going to take the big one. but that doesn't stop it from being hilarious, which, imo, is 'hakuna matata' in a nutshell. it's not what happens, it's how.<br /><br />and a note of warning: there are also some fart jokes. seriously, did you expect anything else in a film where pumbaa takes centre stage? but as fart jokes go, these are especially good, and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur.<br /><br />the returning voice talent is great. i'm kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return, what with most of them only having two or three lines (if they're lucky). whoopi goldberg is particularly welcome.<br /><br />the music is also great. from 'digga tunnah' at the start to 'that's all i need', an adaption of 'warthog rhapsody' (a song that was cut from 'the lion king' and is frankly much improved in this incarnation), the music leaves me with nothing to complain about whatsoever.<br /><br />in the end, timon and pumbaa are awesome characters, and while it may be argued that 'hakuna matata' is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and assorted compromising situations then so be it. it's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with.<br /><br />am i starting to sound creepy?<br /><br />either way, 'the lion king 1 1/2' is great if you've seen 'the lion king' far too many times. especially if you are right now thinking "don't be silly, there's no such thing as seeing 'the lion king' too many times!"
