"the groove tube" was one of only two ken shapiro movies, the other one being the equally zany "modern problems". this one is just a full-scale parody of tv. aside from shapiro - who apparently didn't do anything after "modern problems" - the movie also stars chevy chase and henry winkler's cousin richard belzer. the three cast members (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in various skits. one of the funniest ones features chase in a geritol-spoofing commercial, in which he's describing the medicine as his wife strips, and it ends with her humping him. there's also a pornographic news program, an irritating cooking show, and the epic tale of some drug dealers.<br /><br />anyway, the whole thing's just a real hoot. in my opinion, the three best tv-spoofing movies are this one, plus "tunnelvision" and "kentucky fried movie" (although i might also include "the truman show"). really funny.<br /><br />i wonder what ever did become of ken shapiro.
