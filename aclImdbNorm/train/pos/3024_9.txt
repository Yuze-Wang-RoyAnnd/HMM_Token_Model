a film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war, when a spanish republican, sent by his soon to be overthrown government, (charles boyer) infiltrates himself into england looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in spain. he upsets the locals, getting convincingly beaten in one scene, and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood. notwithstanding socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia, and world politics, this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by katina paxinou and peter lorre, and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by james wong howe, and manages more than once to get under your skin.
