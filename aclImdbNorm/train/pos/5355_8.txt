running man viciously lampoons the modern-day american media complex, and hits its target dead-center. it may be an easy target, but they pull it off none the less. rm effortless takes on pro-wrestling (featuring some pro wrestlers as the hunters), network television, the nielsen ratings, the american government (suggesting it's entertainment-oriented anyway), crime & punishment, and a half-dozen other things along the way. it's a far cry from the original stephen king novella, and arnold is not the ben richards of the novella either. but who cares? it's basically a arnie flick, with all the well-choreographed action sequences and one-liners such an undertaking requires.
