another fun, witty, frothy rko musical with astaire and rogers, follow the fleet is a charming film. while it lacks the stand-out great tunes of swng time (although the final number "face the music and dance" is one of the team's best and rightfully so), it is hugely enjoyable, as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930's. once again, the plot is lightweight and forgettable, but watching fred and ginger dance together is sheer heaven. these two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene. while there are better fred and ginger musicals, this is certainly a must-see.
