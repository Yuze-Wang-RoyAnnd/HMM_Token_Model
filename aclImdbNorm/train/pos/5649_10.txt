i'm watching the series again now that it's out on dvd (yay!) it's striking me as fresh, as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired.<br /><br />the central performances are gripping, the scripts are layered.<br /><br />i'll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that'll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035.<br /><br />i've been asked to write some more line (it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever! pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb way.)<br /><br />well, unlike imdb's submissions editors, american gothic understands that simplicity is everything.<br /><br />in 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons. on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation.<br /><br />when the show first aired, i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off. personally i'm starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years. reckon it don't get more controversial than that!
