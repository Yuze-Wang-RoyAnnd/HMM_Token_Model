arrrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life far too seriously!!! watch this film for what it is, sit back, relax and have a giggle. the film does not take itself seriously, so neither should we. if you like james belushi, you will like this film. if he is not your cup of tea - give it a miss.<br /><br />i like james belushi, so i liked this film. so simple isn't it?? :-)
