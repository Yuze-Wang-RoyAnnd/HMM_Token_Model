i first saw this video 15 years ago. i thought it was excellent then and i still do. i am a former teacher of english (high school and college) and a lover of english romantic poetry, so coleridge rates highly with me. anything which might detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story wouldn't get my vote of excellence. in this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially high school students. the story is well illustrated for a generation which grew up on television. in addition, the voice of michael redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it. okay, so there wasn't a big budget for the project. so it wasn't star wars and there's no cgi in it. but who can dismiss gustave dor'e illustrations as part of the presentation? the comment above, which in just four lines dismisses the video as a piece of trash, is grossly unfair and unperceptive. i'm a friend of the producer, but that isn't my reason for this comment. rather, i'm defending a work of artistry which i think has value on all levels. it is well suited to bring coleridge's poem to students in a way which awakens their appreciation of it and awakens their sympathy for the lesson which the ancient mariner imparts.
