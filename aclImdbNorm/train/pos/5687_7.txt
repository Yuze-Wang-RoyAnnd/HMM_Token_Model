unfortunately, in cases such as these, there are so many conflicting stories as everyone tries to cast blame on to others that it is a near impossibility to get a clear picture of what really happened. this movie is a victim of such circumstances. the writers (too many of them) have decided to take all of the stories and give them to the audience to let them decide which version of the truth they like the best. as in the real life case, there is no clear answer, no conclusion, and the audience is left with a general felling of being unfulfilled (like coffee without the caffeine, or sex without the climax). whodunnits with no whodunnit are generally frustrating and makes you wonder why someone didn't do research before they put it out there. at least tout your movie as a fiction if that is what it amounts to (and this does).<br /><br />that is not to say there are not some great performances here. kilmer (as holmes) does an outstanding role bringing some humanity to what is otherwise an unsavory character. kilmer, and the real life lovers and friends who consulted on the film, let the audience see a selfish, troubled human being who, though his faults were many and large, was loved and cared for by many people (except himself). kudrow as holmes's wife, only gives a glimmer of the dramatic actress she can be, but it is very noticeable and unforgettable glimmer. bosworth's character was not as emotionally complex as she could have been and needed to show more inner conflict to give credence to what ultimately happened between dawn and holmes (she turned him in 6 months after they fled to florida). bosworth's apple-cheeked performance is at time annoying, at times touching, but shows none of the backbone the real schiller must have possessed. the other characters fade in to the woodwork which is a pity. lucas is a great performer who could have sunk his teeth in to this role had it been fleshed out for him. even dylan mcdermott was surprisingly capable in his role of drug dealing biker. <br /><br />the fault of this movie does not lie with this cast, but with the writing. too many cooks spoil the soup, and this kettle, filled with so much promise, ultimately leaves you hungry. the story and characters may have been less than sympathetic, but in what movie of this ilk are they not so? other movies such as 1989's drugstore cowboy starring matt dillon (who was reportedly asked to take this role and refused) worked with similar subject matter and mastered it to such a degree that you felt a kinship with the main character by the end of the movie despite what he had done. van sandt could have given james cox and his crew a few lessons. had someone bothered to try and find the truth, this would have been an intriguing story. as it is, you will find the accompanying wadd documentary more palatable (in the 2 disc dvd)and much more informative. you will realize from the dvd that holmes was not a bad guy, but not a very good one either..as are most people.
