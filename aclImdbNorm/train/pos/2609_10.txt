i'm writing this 9 years after the final episode was aired and i am still reeling from the impact wildside has had on me.<br /><br />it has effectively gone where numerous other cop dramas have gone and succeeded. but it took it further and didn't stray from the realism of the streets, often portraying life events and characters down to a t.<br /><br />i am sorely missing this series, instead we have are given the stupid "underbelly" which is over dramatised and acted creating a whole load of american-esquire garbage.<br /><br />wildside stayed true to the uniqueness of sydney and for that i am truly indebted to this wonderful series. the acting was a-grade and it's a shame to see only a few actors have furthered their career whilst others have faded into obscurity.<br /><br />i don't want australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history, thus i ask the abc to release the complete series on dvd, not the first three. give this series the ending it deserves.
