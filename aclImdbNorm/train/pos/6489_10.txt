i watched this series when it first came out in the 70s.i was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad didn't want to watch it.it became a weekly ritual every sunday, and as anyone will tell you for two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special.<br /><br />the broad sweep of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to document.so the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to each.some episodes covered long periods such as 'wolf pack' which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the atlantic.while the battle of stalingrad had one episode to itself.<br /><br />this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are dead.the list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the time.anthony eden the foreign secretary,carl donnitz,head of the u-boats,albert speer,pet architect confident and later armament minister for hitler.in one of the later episodes we see traudl junge, hitler's secretary,who was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his last will and testament-she left the bunker after hitler's suicide and escaped through the russian lines.these and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayed.<br /><br />if i have any criticism of the series it is that the code-breakers of bletchly park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makers.<br /><br />the opening titles and music are magnificent,and lawrence olivier's narration lends a natural gravity to the script.<br /><br />the best documentary series ever made? without doubt.unmissable
