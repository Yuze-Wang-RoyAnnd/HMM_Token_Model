`mad dog' earle is back, along with his sad-sack moll marie, and that fickle clubfoot velma. so are babe and red, doc and big mac, and even the scenery-chewing mutt pard. the only thing missing is a good reason for remaking raoul walsh's high sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame, and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original. (instead of walsh we get stuart heisler, for humphrey bogart we get jack palance, for ida lupino shelley winters, and so on down through the credits.) the only change is that, this time, instead of black-and-white, it's in warnercolor; sadly, there are those who would count this an improvement.<br /><br />i died a thousand times may be unnecessary
