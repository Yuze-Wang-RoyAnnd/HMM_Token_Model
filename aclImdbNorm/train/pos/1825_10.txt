i've seen this movie when i was young, and i remembered it as one of the first films i have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. so, in my later years i decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. to my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. it's a great movie. emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explains why i did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a great use to my time. i was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that i have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which i first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then. maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). yes, there are continuity glitches. yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter. the movie itself is fun and smart. so don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. it gets 10 simply because it made me feel.
