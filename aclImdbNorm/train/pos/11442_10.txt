<br /><br />so, not being a poet myself, i have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. the effortless motion of goldsworthy, as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating. watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work, and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot. be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web.<br /><br />the genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself. it is in the essential change of nature where his work, though complete in its own sphere, is made whole.
