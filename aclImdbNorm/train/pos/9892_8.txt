this movie is such cheesy goodness.<br /><br />a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school. they start getting killed off, they know they are being stalked, so what do they do? one girl decides to take a bath, another decides to cheat on her husband (who is also there) with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) and go at it.<br /><br />and it comes through with the gore and the t&a.<br /><br />and it's also interesting from a historical/sociological point of view. where the usual 80's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves, or how adults view young people, or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective. this is a brit film made to be an american slasher. it's hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak "american" unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents.<br /><br />if you like cheesy 80's slashers (like pieces) then you will like this one.
