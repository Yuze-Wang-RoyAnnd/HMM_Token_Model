edmund lowe (who reminds me somewhat of warren william), heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour.<br /><br />douglas walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise (hypnotism, anyone?), and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast--everyone from virginia bruce, kent smith, frieda inescourt, gene lockhart, jessie ralph, benita hume, rosalind ivan and h.b. warner. as an added bonus, there's nat pendleton as a dimwit detective--and furthermore, get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home. must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film.<br /><br />on the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled. it's all suddenly clear to detective philo vance--and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense.<br /><br />nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner.
