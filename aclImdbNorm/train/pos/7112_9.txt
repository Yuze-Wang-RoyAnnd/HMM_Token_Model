a very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on guadalcanal and must come home and re-adjust himself with the help of family and friends. an excellent cast of actor's helps make this movie very entertaining. eleanor parker's role as the girlfriend was worthy of an oscar nomination. she has such an innocence to her in this movie. ann doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles. i especially like the hometown aura of pre-war phildelphia. the hunting scene is very good. of course the war scene on guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle. a well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten
