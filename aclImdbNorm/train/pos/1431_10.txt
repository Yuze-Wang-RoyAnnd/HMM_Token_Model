this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see. i thought it was just another documentary, but it really is something else. it doesn't try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature.<br /><br />i won't talk about the quality of the pictures, because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched.<br /><br />earth is funny, tense and sad. it can make you laugh, it can make you cry. sometimes both at the same time. this is the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with, yet we don't appreciate it one bit.<br /><br />this movie should be shown obligatory in schools. it is the most wonderful film you will ever see, so go and see it. who knows, maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this...<br /><br />10/10, but i would easily rate it more if it were possible.
