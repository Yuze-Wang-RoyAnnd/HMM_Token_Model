christopher lloyd is funny and really believable as "al the head angel". this movie is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and writing.<br /><br />ok - it was written for kids, but adults have as much fun as the kids do. tony danza does a very realistic job in his role - but this is not a taxi reunion.<br /><br />danny glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his emotions as well as showing some real acting talent for a change, a pleasant change.<br /><br />watch at least once - it is worth the effort to catch it.
