princess tam tam is without the trappings of racism, in the way we think of racism in the united states, but there are more subtle (to the american viewer) assertions about ethnic identity during the time. pay attention to alwina's (baker) placement within shots, how she is addressed by the other characters, the settings around her that all depict her as a "savage" african, and ask yourself if alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film. i don't want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention, the dichotomy between "eastern" and "western" culture is to say the least offensive, such diction is thankfully disavowed these days. the french have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted (see chris marker's les statues meurent aussi- 1953), and pay attention to the places the european travelers visit while they are in africa, and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the "other". i give this film a 7 because i am a sucker for baker, much of what she did in her professional career, like princes tam tam, that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration, her work as a freaking spy (i am gushing, sorry.) however the film for me is captivating because of her performance, besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities.
