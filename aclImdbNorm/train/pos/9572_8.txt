those individuals familiar with asian cinema, as a whole, are aware that japan is renowned, or notorious, for it's hyper-violent films and korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously brutal films. dog bites dog, while not necessarily getting as hyper-violent as the craziest miike film, nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some koreas more ambitious efforts, it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all it's own. the greatest strength this film has though, like the greatest of the japanese or korean efforts, is that the brutality, rather than detracting from the film, actually develops the characters, if not, pushing the story forward. the two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such. sam lee's character, for instance, is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely, amidst various encounters with chang's character, it is revealed why he is. without spoiling this part of the story too much, it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father. chang's character, on the other hand, has his most primal instincts honed to, if not perfection, brutal efficiency. surprisingly, chang's story arch, while not necessarily revealing a more human side, actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal (and no i am not talking about sam lee, rather pei pei's garbage dump girl character). ultimately however, for the first 80 minutes or so, it is a, more or less, straight forward cat and mouse, or dog chase dog, film in which every encounter ends in at least one death (seriously, once sam lee and chang square off, some one will die) and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act. which brings us to the film's one weakness. unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but, to put it simply, it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since, rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film, the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it. don't get me wrong, if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasn't filled with sweet music (in fact if it, like the majority of the film, kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job), it still could have worked and not detract from the film. as it is though, despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters, the way it was handled made it feel tacked on, and almost, insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across. nevertheless, it is still a breath of fresh air from hong kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact.
