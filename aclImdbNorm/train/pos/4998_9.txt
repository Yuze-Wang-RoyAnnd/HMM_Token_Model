shannon lee,the daughter of bruce lee,delivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating hong kong movie and proves that like her late brother brandon she is a real chip off the old block. there is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of "and now,you're dead". when you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created.i genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut. bruce lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring shannon does not let the family name down here.although there are several pleasing performances in this movie (michel wong for one)it is shannon lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as mandy the hitgirl supreme.hell;you may well come away whistling her fights!
