this is a very, very early bugs bunny cartoon. as a result, the character is still in a transition period--he is not drawn as elongated as he later was and his voice isn't quite right. in addition, the chemistry between elmer and bugs is a little unusual. elmer is some poor sap who buys bugs from a pet shop--there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens! however, despite this, this is still a very enjoyable film. the early bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations. in later films, he messed with elmer, yosimite sam and others because they started it--they messed with the rabbit. but, in this film, he is much more like daffy duck of the late 30s and early 40s--a jerk who just loves irritating others!! a true "anarchist" instead of the hero of the later cartoons. while this isn't among the best bug bunny cartoons, it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see just how much he's changed over the years.
