the reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did!! that means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it. when i first saw this movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion. this is not a blood and gore scary type movie, but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written. of course non believers will say its only a sci-fi movie. truth is, this movie is a must have for your thriller collection, even if it does have a religious view. if you are a fan of classic thrillers (omen..etc) this is one of them and its a must have. i never saw the sequel (distant thunder), but i believe it picks up where this movie ends.
