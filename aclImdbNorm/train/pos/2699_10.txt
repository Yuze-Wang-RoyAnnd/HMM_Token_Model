there are other reviews here so i don't need to say how great it is or what it's about...my point is: i heard about this movie ages ago, before it was shown. i can't even remember how, i just know it was through the internet. the distributors went under before it ever hit! for months i moped and complained. please note that on this page there's a link to buy this film and the only highlighted area is vhs at amazon.com in germany. you can use alta vista's babelfish to translate. i know it's pal format and they did change the text on the screen to german and there's a tiny little bit of narration at the beginning that's also been dubbed in german, but as hilarious and campy as this film is, it really only makes it funnier! if you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that does conversions it's so worth it! it cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the u.s. from germany. trust me, it might seem like a lot to spend on a film, but if you're into corny b-flicks you'll be blowing money left and right getting conversions for your friends!
