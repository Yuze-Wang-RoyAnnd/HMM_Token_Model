there are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious, political and societal means. not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as wage inequality, and marginalization in society, all in the name of allah or god or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject.<br /><br />the setting is the 2006 match between iran and bahrain to qualify for the world cup. passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match.<br /><br />the women who were caught (played by sima mobarak-shahi, shayesteh irani, ayda sadeqi, golnaz farmani, and mahnaz zabihi) and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and, most likely, all muslim countries. their interaction with the iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them, both city and villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules.<br /><br />it is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save it's women from the crude behavior of it's men. rather than educating the male population, they deny privilege and rights to the women.<br /><br />seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of iranian society, it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in iran. but jafar panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it.
