this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters. i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone reviews) and was intrigued for two solid hours. two lost ships from two different worlds collide. the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact. toward the end i couldn't decide which i wanted more: our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion. rml could've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty. i'm nitpicking though. after a series of netflix, blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making.
