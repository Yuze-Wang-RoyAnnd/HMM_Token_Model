yes, keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film. with a skip in his step in his tailored pin-striped suits, he'll remind you of jimmy cagney! johnny (keaton) is the young hood who only does it to pay for his mother's high-priced medical bills & to send his younger brother (griffin dunne) to law school. no one even knows johnny kelly is johnny dangerously until later on in the film. joe piscopo is vermin & doesn't like johnny one bit (& i don't like vermin). marilu henner has a nice singing/dancing routine while johnny revels in it. i love the part when they're in the ever-changing getaway car! the cop who's "calling all cars" is the skipper from gilligan's island! see this one for 1930's gangster laughs! the gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you'll miss them! look in the background of every scene.
