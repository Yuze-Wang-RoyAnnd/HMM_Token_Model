when you come across a gem of a movie like this, you realize why the '80s were the greatest decade to live thru. the rock music ruled, & so did movies...especially horror movies. filmmakers knew how to entertain us, & "trick or treat" is evident to this. when rocker sammi curr, who was most likely written after w.a.s.p. singer blackie lawless, dies in a hotel fire, his #1 fan eddie, is distraught. he goes to friend & local dj nuke (gene simmons) for support. nuke gives him a copy of the very last recording that sammi made; this is the only copy available. it was given to the radio station to be played live halloween night. when eddie plays it, it somehow brings back sammi. he helps eddie with the bullies at school, but then goes out of control. it is definitely one great movie. the bad thing is, this movie is out of print. i paid $25.00 to finally get it off of ebay. you should too...$$ well spent!
