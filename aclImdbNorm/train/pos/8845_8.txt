the beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing , but sit tight, because you are in for the ride of your life. the concept is compelling, with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story. there are fine performances all around, with phillip seymour hoffman's being the best of the cast-no surprise there. ethan hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well. the direction by mr. lumet is outstanding. the film has a seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story, but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs. you will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film.
