i caught this movie on t.v. last night and you know danny masterson was a pretty good actor in the film, and its great to see him in something other than that 70s show. the film isnt rated but in my opinion i would rate it (r) just because of the nudity and plenty of adult content. but all in all i loved it, i thought that dirt's wisecracks were pretty funny. its just basically about a guy who has no job, girlfriend, or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (more of a messenger really.)he gets framed for the murder of a rock star and the rock stars girlfriend is one of the people that really need to help him out. i give it....*** 3 stars.
