i like the good and evil battle. i liked eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done. he wasn't the smart, cocky, know it all he usually plays. he shows heart and a more humble humor. the fact that it shows there are stranger things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope.
