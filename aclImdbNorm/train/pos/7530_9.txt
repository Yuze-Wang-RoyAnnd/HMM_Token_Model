this is so to say a sequel to batman the animated and it is pretty much as good as it to and for all the same reasons it has lots of action in it the storyline to it is good the voice over actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman, mark hamil as the joker, etc. the villains are really good such as the joker, two-face, catwoman, clayface, etc. so i am sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of batman because it is really good. so make sure that you watch it on tv or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really good.<br /><br />overall score: ********* out of ********** <br /><br />**** out of *****
