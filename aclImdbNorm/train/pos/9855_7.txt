this is my first cg animated film that i've ever seen. usually, the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them. not ice age. i wanted to see it the moment i saw the trailer with scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel.<br /><br />ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch. the story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby, set 20,000 years in the past. the visuals were great. simply beautiful. it's one thing to create convincing aninmation, it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visuals. blue sky studios is a company to look out for in the future.
