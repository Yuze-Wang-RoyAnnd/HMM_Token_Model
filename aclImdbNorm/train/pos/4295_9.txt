alain chabat claims this movie as his original idea but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally get it together is as old, if not older, than shakespeare.<br /><br />chabat is a "vieux garcon", happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. he has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mum - the g7 - who decide he should be married. enter the delightful, charming charlotte gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. charlotte has to pose as chabat's girlfriend and then simply not turn up on the day of the wedding. no more talk of marriage from the g7. of course the best laid plans have a habit of spiralling out of control.<br /><br />there are very strong supporting roles from lafont as the mother and osterman as the tight-fisted brother of gainsbourg.<br /><br />there are some fantastic scenes as first charlotte has to charm, then revolt the family. french farce with an english.
