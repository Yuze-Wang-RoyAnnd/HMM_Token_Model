here's the kind of love story that i do enjoy watching. and mostly, it's for two reasons. one, it concentrates of young people, very young people. people who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are. all of us have been there in our lives and "the man in the moon" is a magnificent reflection upon our memories, maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. the second reason is that is a love triangle. and i do believe that as teens, it's the most dramatic. and the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love, or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs, will believe it for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />the cast of "the man in the moon" is full of great talented names. it stars sam waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict, yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. also there is tess harper, jason london, and a young, young reese witherspoon. you look at the young, talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road, she's going to win the academy award. all members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay, they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. as if it all really happened. this the kind of movie that i would like to see come out more often. love story or not. i would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way.
