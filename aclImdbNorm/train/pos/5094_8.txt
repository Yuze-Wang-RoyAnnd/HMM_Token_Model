if you a purist, don't waste your time - otherwise, hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure. i loved the stewart granger/deborah kerr version - i've seen it dozens of times, but this film is every bit as good, only different. i won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film. also, it is a pleasure to see alison doody again (i'm a huge indiana jones fan), patrick swayze is good as quatermain, and the supporting cast is superb. i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a hallmark production and this film was no exception. the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. if you are looking for entertainment, you won't be disappointed.
