the idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it. but it is so subtle you don't know how to read it! are these guys doing a full blown comedy or is there something else going on. the little dialogue the film has isn't very delicate and this adds to the power of the film. if all the sound was switched off from the film it actually wouldn't take anything away from the film. the physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story.<br /><br />i is a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame. i first say this film as part of a "black" film festival. after watching the film i was so impressed by the work. but then i asked myself what next? where can someone else see this work? the common association of art without purpose isn't to be found here. you can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish. the usage of african music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason. the character development is amazing. the casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film; the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of actual film.<br /><br />we need to see more of these kinds of films, there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board.
