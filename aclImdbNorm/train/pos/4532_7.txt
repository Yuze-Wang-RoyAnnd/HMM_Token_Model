this was keaton's first feature and is in actuality three shorts, set in different periods (stone age, roman age, modern age) on the eternal triangle of romance. the stories parallel each other as in griffith's intolerance, which this was intended to satirize. the strengths of the jokes and gags almost all rely on anachronisms, bringing modern day business into ancient settings.<br /><br />**** warning - spoilers follow to elaborate best points ******<br /><br />here are the classic moments:<br /><br />using a turtle as a wee-gee board (stone age); a wrist watch containing a sun dial (roman age); a chariot with a spare wheel (roman age); using a helmet as a tire lock (roman age); early golf with clubs and rocks(stone age); dictating a will being carved into a rock (stone age); the changing weather forecaster (roman age); the chariot race in snow -buster using skis and huskies with a spare dog in the chariot's boot(roman age).<br /><br />the above are all throw-away gags that keep us chuckling. there are however unforgettable moments as well:<br /><br />buster taking out shaving equipment to match girl putting on make-up; the fantastic double take when an inebriated buster gazes at his plate to discover a crab staring up at him (within one second he has leaped to stand on his chair from a sitting position and leaped again into the arms of the waiter - one of the funniest moments i've ever seen). and that lion - the manicure -just brilliant.<br /><br />there's also an off-color bit of racism when four african-american litter bearers abandon their mistress for a roman crap game.<br /><br />kino's print is a bit fuzzy and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate deterioration and film damage- most probably at ends of reels. the metro feature is scored with piano and flute and borrows heavily from grieg.<br /><br />lots of fun and full of laughs.
