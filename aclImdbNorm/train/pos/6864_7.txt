saw this movie the first time while drunk at a motel in canada. while flipping through channels came across the easy lube part. my friend kept flipping but i told him to go back. something about the name easy lube just didn't sound right. watched the rest of the movie it was pretty damn funny. jotted down a couple of names from the credits and got home to look it up. turned out to be chevy chase's first movie. i didn't remember him in it. didn't remember much about it, so i rented it and gave it a second veiw. it's pretty funny and quite graphic. it's just like kentucky fried movie except not as funny. love the fingers, easy lube, and i'm da f**kin' president parts. dealers skit is pretty cool too. i give it a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
