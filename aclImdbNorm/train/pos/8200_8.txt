clint eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this, but this one does not embarrass him. dirty harry catches everyone's attention and unless one wants to watch romance, there is no reason why you won't like him. he is cool because he is dirty, is great because he kills without much thinking, is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care.<br /><br />from what i have seen in movies in which eastwood acts, the character of the lead role always captivates the audience. in white hunter black heart, he is the crazy director, in "in the line of fire" he is the "old 'un" while here is the "almost" jobless with his job, that is to say he makes work for himself, doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation.<br /><br />based on a rape victim, this movie is promising for all the "no non-sense" movie watchers. the movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot. however, what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not, as it is far too obvious from the beginning. it is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving. also, there are too many people far dirtier than dirty harry.
