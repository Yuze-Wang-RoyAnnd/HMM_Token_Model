i find alan jacobs review very accurate concerning the movie;however i had the opportunity to rent the dvd from blockbuster with a commentary from byu's curator, motion picture archives james d'arc. the then lds prophet heber j. grant approved of the movie understanding the deviations from historic content for dramatic expression and telescoping events. for example the movie showed joseph smith on trial. despite brigham young's great oratory in defense of joseph smith he was convicted anyway. then joseph was killed. historically joseph smith was never convicted of anything. brigham young was in boston when joseph smith was arrested for this particular trial. joseph smith and his brother hyrum where both killed before the trial took place.
