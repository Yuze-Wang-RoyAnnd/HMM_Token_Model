this is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of that which is very surreal. it has this hazy overtone that is rarely captured on film, it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a dark haunting memory. the kids were extremely believable and i do expect some things to come of them in the future. very natural acting for such young ones, i don't know if bill pulled it out of them or there just that good, but no the less excellent. bill scored as far as i'm concerned and for the comment by kevnjeff about mr. paxtons bad acting, what can one do in that role. he played the part rather well in my opinion. this is coming from someone who said hamlet was good (the ethan hawke version?) wow......... do not listen to his comments. great flick to make you feel really uncomfortable, if that's what you want? cinematography gets an above the average rating also.
