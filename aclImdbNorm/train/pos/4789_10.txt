david lynch's (1999) film of john roach / mary sweeney's story is set in iowa and wisconsin some time well before the film's eventual release.<br /><br />we come into the life of alvin straight (richard farnsworth) late on in life. his medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it.<br /><br />this makes what he decides to do, even more remarkable and endearing. he decides (and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions) to put a few things straight.<br /><br />alvin is, by this time in his life, a man of great experience but modest means. his daughter rose (sissy spacek) struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf. but it's worth it, because rose's story cannot help but come out as the film progresses.<br /><br />this film is the story of a journey. but like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. early on in the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which no elderly gentleman of alvin's age should reasonably undertake.<br /><br />but along the way, we slowly learn how alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective. his objective is very simple and straightforward. his brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him. he has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time.<br /><br />along the way, alvin meets many people. the way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film. we come to know who alvin straight is, from what alvin straight does. and at the end of the film, we know who we are .. better.
