"silverlake life" is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward. actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illuminations, see something else. and it's by no means a tearjerker. but i mean that in positive ways. it shows two men who love each other and how being afflicted with aids is affecting the quality of their every-day lives. it's almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not, because it was so undressed that i had to look for other ways to respond. it's an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents i've ever seen. these two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. it makes hollow-wood productions on aids seem hip and heartless. these men made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. the scene where tom sings "you are my sunshine" to mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing.
