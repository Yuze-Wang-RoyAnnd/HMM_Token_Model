let's eliminate any discussion about the use of non-asian actors playing asian roles. the movie is 67 years old. in 1937 studio chiefs believed that any actor could/should be able to play any role. actors were under contracts, and did not always have a choice about what role they played. end of story.<br /><br />this is a truly great epic story of love, individual rights, class strata, and men/women issues. the centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by luise rainer and paul muni. <br /><br />muni plays wang, a chinese farmer, who is about to take a wife (rainer). from the start, he treats her with respect, during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help. without giving too much of the movie away, they go through the highs and lows of all relationships, and even though the story may take place in late 19th/early 20th century,the story and much of their feelings, seems credible.<br /><br />other than the fact that the movie is about 5-10 minutes longer than it needs to be, and the performances of charley grapewin and walter connolly are typical 1930's cartoon characters, this is a really wonderful movie that, unfortunately, has become a victim of political correctness.<br /><br />9 out of 10
