strangler of the swamp was made by low budget studio prc and is certainly one of their best movies i've seen.<br /><br />a man who was hanged for a murder he didn't commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him. he uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp, he disappears. the old man's granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married.<br /><br />this movie has plenty of foggy atmospheres, which makes it very creepy too.<br /><br />the cast includes rosemary la planche, blake edwards and charles middleton (flash gordon) as the strangler.<br /><br />strangler of the swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself. excellent.<br /><br />rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
