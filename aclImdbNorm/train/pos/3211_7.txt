this movie is ok if you like mindless action ,corny acting, and a very small plot !the special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of"event horizon". the costumes are like something from a mad max movie .none of the soldiers talk ,so others tell them what to do.it eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place. i personally liked russell better in "tango and cash""escape from la/new york" and "executive decision". it must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie!!
