now this is what i'm talking about. finally, a low-budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage. wendigo, while occasionally flawed, is a triumph of the imagination. granted, it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness, but it's still a damn sight better than 99% of direct to video dross.<br /><br />the story is pretty simple: a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter. but director larry fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo. is it real? is it all in the boy's imagination? is it an externalization of the child's emotional state? <br /><br />some have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because it's left to you to decide. don't be put off by such petty nonsense. a film that makes you think is not one to avoid. it's one to rejoice in.
