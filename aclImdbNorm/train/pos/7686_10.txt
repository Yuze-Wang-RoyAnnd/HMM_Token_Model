after enjoying this show for years, i use to dream of being able to see them all again and share them with my grandchildren. i am so happy to pay a small amount for the memories that i have found recorded on dvd. florida was a caring mother with a loving hard working husband, one spoiled beautiful daughter and two sons as different as day and night. michael, the baby son is a freedom walker and jj is a clown. i know many afro-americans disliked this show, but i know many can relate and should have accepted it as it was. my heart was sad when i learned that ester rolle had passed. tyler perry is now the leading writer actor of today and i support his work, but not as much since he made such cruel mocking of rolle in one of his plays. no one should have to hear ugly things about physical appearance. the show started getting less interesting when daddy james died. it picked up a bit when florida remarried, but slumped when she took an absence from the show. in all, the show was great and again i am pleased to own copies of part of my past. i do try to keep up with the work of the former stars of good times, and i must say, they are one group who has not been wiped up and down with rumors. i think children of today will enjoy this show and i have no problem sitting and watching with children. congrats to the writer, crew, and stars for years of renewed memories of a time that i can once again enjoy without having to skip scenes.<br /><br />ok so i watch the shows over and over. lately i have noticed thing that has made me rethink the series, but not dislike them. i think florida was a bit harsh when it came to money that the children made. not that the children did not need supervision, but it was done in a way that makes florida's mothering different. the scenes where florida had to speak about how other people were not very good looking bothers me now. when james was alive, the show made a big thing out of james wanting his own fix-it shop, but never lived to see his family out of the projects, but florida marries someone who owns a fix-it shop. a bit of a slap in the face to an actor who should have ended his time on good times showing that he accomplished all he strove for. lastly, as i watch the shows, i see the series going in to overtime and being renamed "jj". to be truthful, after james left everything mostly centered around jj. not a bad thing, just a noticeable thing. i would not trade my dvd's for any amount of money, but time, maturity and experience began to guide your eyes after a while.
