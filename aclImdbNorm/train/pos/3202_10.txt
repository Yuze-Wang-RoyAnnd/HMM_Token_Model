i can't understand why many imdb users don't like this movie. why they think it's sooooo bad etc. it's not worse than anything else out there. personally i think "soldier" is a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre.<br /><br />reasons why i liked "soldier": kurt russel, connie nielsen, jason scott lee, the script (david webb peoples), great visual effects, and the directing (paul anderson).<br /><br />i even think that this is the best work i've seen from director paul anderson, who has previously directed the entertaining "mortal kombat" and the not so entertaining "event horizon".
