"fraidy cat", the 4th of these cartoons, is a good one. at least i like it, so i'm surprised that this is getting mixed reviews.<br /><br />this one is more of a macabre story than a funny one, although it has its moments of comedy. the atmosphere is dark and spooky. suspense is another strong element here. as for humor, it's mostly dark humor.<br /><br />in this short, tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it is about ghosts, something he believes. while tom is scared to death, jerry is watching everything and can't help but laugh the whole time. in fact, jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. with the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner he creates a big "ghost".<br /><br />tom lives the scariest experience of his whole life. although jerry scares tom without a good reason, the way the story is made ends up being funny. plus, once again, there is no violence here because this is one of tom & jerry's oldest cartoons. however, i don't get that joke of tom's 9 lives nearly sucked into the vacuum cleaner.<br /><br />when tom finally finds out that it was all a jerry's scheme and that jerry made a fool out of him, jerry is <<caught with the hand in the cookie jar>> (he deserves to be discovered). yet, tom shows an incredible patience before reacting. he angrily looks at jerry for about a minute. the funny thing is that jerry invites tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that tom is looking at him with a very serious face. jerry tries to be funny, but tom doesn't laugh.<br /><br />overall, this is a different, peculiar and remarkable tom & jerry experience.
