a great concept, a great cast, and what a pity there wasn't more time to flesh out the story. i loved it and wanted more. dench, dukakis, and laine, now there are some real women! still, dench and her character alone had enough substance to carry the script over some of its lesser moments. i have it on tape and will continue to watch it, hoping that there is a clue at the end that suggests there will be a sequel.<br /><br />top drawer! - no question! - no argument!<br /><br />
