considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films, i have no argument with that, although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining. one thing: it's the longest of the series that i've seen at 105 minutes. i've only seen six of them but this was longer than i'm used to and with the drawn-out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long.<br /><br />nonetheless, it is a good mixture of action, suspense and romance. the only things missing are color and stereo sound. the primitive special-effects don't bother me, as that was all that they had back in the 1930s.<br /><br />among some, this film is most noted for one thing: skin! "jane" never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays' code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made. her outfit showed what a great figure maureen o'sullivan possessed. the nude underwater scene, however, was not her - by a longshot. the woman under the water didn't have a good figure at all, whoever it was.<br /><br />there is plenty of action in here. up to the finale, it was not overdone, either. the ending went on for 15 minutes, though, and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch.<br /><br />still, this movie offers about everything - except "boy" (their adopted son) - you'd want to see in a tarzan film, even o'sullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times. with her pair of "lungs," that was no problem.
