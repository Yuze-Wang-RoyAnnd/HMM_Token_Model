the best modesty blaise movie i have seen so far. it's like a good pilot for a tv-series. i even think it's a little bit "cult", like with a lite touch of quentin tarantino's magic, or something. they have caught a great deal of modesty's character, but i admit missing willy garwin a bit. even if i have read many comics and book by peter o'donnell i'm not disappointed of this film, quite the opposite. positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood. i did not put my expectations so high, because of the bad movie from 1966. so i may have overrate this movie just a little. but if you like the comics and other storys about modesty blaise, you should definitely see this one! can't wait for a follow-up...
