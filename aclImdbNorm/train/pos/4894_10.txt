i grew up during the time that the music in this movie was popular. what a wonderful time for music and dancing! my only complaint was that i was a little too young to go to the uso and nightclubs. guess it sounds like i'm living in the past, (i do have wonderful memories)so what's wrong with that?!!? world war 2 was a terrible time, except where music was concerned. glenn miller's death was a terrible sadness to us. this movie will be a favorite of mine. clio laine was excellent; what a voice! i don't know how i ever missed this movie. my main reason for this commentary is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to rap and new age music, which is offensive to me. please watch this movie and give it a chance!
