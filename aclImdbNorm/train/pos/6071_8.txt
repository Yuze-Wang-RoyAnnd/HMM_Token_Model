i claim no matter how hard i seek i'll never find a better movie version of "othello". if you love kenneth branagh's magnificent masterpieces "much ado about nothing" (1993) and "hamlet" (1996) as much as i do i'm dead certain you'll also find oliver parker's "othello" irresistible. laurence fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career. he was quite terrific in "boys n the hood" (1991) - i've always considered his amusing role of furious styles as his very greatest achievement. that was, of course, way before i saw this.<br /><br />he plays the part of othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant, fantastic job. ir`ene jacob is absolutely charming desdemona and kenneth branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story's crooked, manipulate villain iago. marvelous "othello" is part of the absolute elite among shakespeare's ingenious works. it deals with his favorite topics: crookedness, envy, deceitfulness and jealousy. this movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films i've seen that's based on william shakespeare's plays.
