the film is exceptional in it's gay iconography and extends this beyond the asthetics to the music and cast. throughout the whole film exists a childlike wonder as seen through the eyes of the main character. her lighthearted take on the world around us is comical and beautiful. in a way it's a slacker movie for girls. watch this is you fancy a relaxing entertaining mid-night movie. buy this if you like diferent takes on the world of media and love combined (?).
