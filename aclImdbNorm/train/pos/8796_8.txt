<br /><br />everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors. that is to say that what might be number one priority for people like bush, blair and company, may not be so for a great many other people, ordinary people. from the opening scene in which an iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened, with the result the children are not impressed, as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in new york, usa, wherever that is, this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not all things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess. <br /><br />whereas, obviously, the attack on the wtc was a dastardly event by any yardstick, one does get the impression that both politicians and tv cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion - wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces. would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on lagos, say, or djakarta, say, or even on rio de janeiro, say? i rather think not. news seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen: much more tv time is given to an earthquake in italy, say, than one ten times more destructive in outer mongolia, say. greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster. <br /><br />this series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective - or, perhaps i should say, some of the pieces do, as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story, his own translated perspective, such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits, but individually for each eleven-minute segment. <br /><br />in no way should one deduce that this is an anti-american film: that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments. however, it is not pro-american either. the eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link - if there is one - is that the disaster of the wtc attack has to be seen in perspective from different view-points. only then will such people as george bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on. <br /><br />clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine i have been harbouring for two years now: america has not learnt the lesson. and the lesson is that the usa has to share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force. instead of learning that the usa cannot continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere, its political leaders, aided and abetted by blair (and even aznar) have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant, which is not doing any good to anyone in afghanistan or irak at present, let alone much elsewhere. the white house mentality is totally rejectable: the us and uk invaded irak and caused all the chaos, and so should clear up the mess they caused - not insist on the un and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil. <br /><br />radical stances adopted by the us (or even israel) is only going to be met by radical stances from islamic people, who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism, if only to cover up their own macho uselessness, i.e., stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground. <br /><br />the world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives. this film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture.
