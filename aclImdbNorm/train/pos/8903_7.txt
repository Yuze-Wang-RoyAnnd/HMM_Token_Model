sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, but don't let that fool you. in my little book, there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor. catch the redoubtable mrs. porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. she not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. and where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not show up well in b&w. yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate. but except for several of the teens, the non-hollywood cast performs well. then too, the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining. pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". then again, the 27-year old mcqueen hardly qualifies in the age department, but manages the hot-rodder attitude anyway. the movie was a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play. and except for the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, drive-in or no drive-in. meanwhile, i'm awaiting the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, refrigerator water.
