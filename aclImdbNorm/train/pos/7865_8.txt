page 3 is a great movie. the story is so refreshing and interesting. not once throughout the movie did i find myself staring off into space. konkana sen did a good job in the movie, although i think someone with more glamour or enthusiasm would have been better, but she did do a great job. all the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie along. boman irani did a great job. there is one thing that stands out in this movie the story it is great, and very realistic, it doesn't beat around the bush it is very straight forward in sending out its message. i think more movie like this should be made, i am sick of watching the same candy floss movies over and over, they are getting hard to digest now. everyone should watch page 3, it is a great film. -just my 2 cents :)
