why can't more directors these days create horror movies like "the shining"? there's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not stanley kubrick. kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time.<br /><br />so, the plot is fairly simple. a man named jack torrance (played brilliantly by jack nicholson)and his family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. the kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls. what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what i mean.<br /><br />this is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as "scary". it's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. music has been a major part of kubrick's movies (2001: a space oddysey and a clockwork orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one. the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it.<br /><br />finally, i must comment on nicholson's legendary performance. jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. in fact, just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie. this is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe.<br /><br />there will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. r.i.p. stanley.
