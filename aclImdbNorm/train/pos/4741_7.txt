what more could i say? the americans totally hated it because the u.s. cut was so bad, although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it.<br /><br />talking about the u.s. theatrical release(along with the newly released blu-ray disc version), it's faster and tighter than hk cut, the background musics were all changed from the dark, grim hk musics to hip-hop musics; and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out. though, the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor's voice and tone. but, the problem is hak hap(black mask) the movie was designed and meant to be dark, grim, super-disturbing and totally gruesome. very unfortunately the u.s. release just skimmed the cream they wanted, which in return completely changed the movie's undertone(hk release was rated 18+) to be even more comical and amateurish.<br /><br />now let's talk about the original hk release. this movie is like a hidden gem, a prototype for the whole "matrix" tide and era. the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit "old-school" among hk movies. however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture. with all the leather, black costumes and decorations, this movie features a batman-like superhero in a black mask against a run-of-the-mill gang of multinational super-soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss. yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child, but it works. it's so impressive that the whole movie's gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats. in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg-13 rating, but without jet li and liu qing yun. and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship. and, did i happen to mention francois yip? her roundhouse kick was totally cool, even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting. did i mention she was also smoking hot? anyway, there are a lot of things to like about the movie.<br /><br />however, the movie also suffered from a lot of problems. first off, it's a mediocre script made at its best potential, which means this production team deserved a better screen-writer. there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far-fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences(us version was even worse because all the character developments were cut). anyway, you can't ask too much out of a comic-inspired action movie. also, this movie is entirely improper for children. i won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old. it's saturated with disturbing contents including blood, gore, sado-maso costumes, extreme brutal violence and so on. along with the style of the movie, it can be called a wet dream for heavy-metal rock music fans and action fans. (the u.s. cut was milder, but if you want to see it, see the hk release for what it is.) 7/10. status: inspiring, hidden, undervalued, adult.
