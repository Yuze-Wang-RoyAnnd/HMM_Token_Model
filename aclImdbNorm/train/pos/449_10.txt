for anyone who's judged others at first meeting, here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character. the grumpy old lady has a soft, thoughtful heart - and needs new friends. the flighty, unsure, 'ditsy' dame who makes inappropriate, uncomfortable comments - sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all. the cold, prim, proper, neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute - given the right setting. the perfect beauty - rich, sweet, partying, pursued by throngs - wants peace, quiet, and love without possessiveness. <br /><br />by taking the time to look beyond the surface, you will find treasures in everyday life, from the least expected sources. all it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment.
