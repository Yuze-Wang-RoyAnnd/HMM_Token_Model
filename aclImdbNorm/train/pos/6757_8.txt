dana andrews stands "where the sidewalk ends" in this 1950 film that also stars gene tierney, gary merrill, karl malden and neville brand. andrews plays new york city detective sgt. mark dixon, a cop with a bad temper who has gotten into trouble in the past for beating suspects. when a man is murdered at a gambling club owned by a mobster, scalise (merrill), dixon and his partner go to investigate. scalise blames the murder on ken paine (stevens), who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife, morgan (tierney) but the victim. dixon thinks the victim won a lot of money and was killed as a result by the mobster's men. he goes to see paine and, not realizing he has a plate in his head from the war, knocks him to the floor and inadvertently kills him. now he must cover up the murder. as a further complication, he falls for morgan; her father (ken tully), who went to paine's apartment after he saw that paine had hit his daughter, is arrested for the crime.<br /><br />this is a really terrific, gritty noir with some good performances. the ruggedly handsome and weathered andrews is convincing as a tough yet nervous detective who has to stay one step ahead of his colleagues. the movie reunites him with his fabulous "laura" costar, gene tierney, and she looks lovely as a model with bad taste in men who apparently is used to being roughed up. little does she know, she's got another one on her hands. ken tully does a terrific job as her father, who protests his innocence despite some damning evidence. karl malden is very tough as dixon's boss.<br /><br />my only problem with this well-directed, fast-moving and absorbing film is the ending. pure hollywood and, putting myself in tierney's place, i doubt i would react the same way. a minor criticism for a film written by ben hecht and directed by otto preminger. i didn't find it as awe-inspiring as "laura," but few things in this world are. if you like film noir, this is a must-see.
