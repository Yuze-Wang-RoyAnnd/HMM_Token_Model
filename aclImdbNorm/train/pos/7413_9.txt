shower keeps within itself in so many ways. almost all of the movie takes place in an old- time bathhouse, with the denizens supplying the humor, pathos, and emotional touches. the love and friendship between the proprietor and his retarded son is deep and moving. the way the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unforced and persuasive. the plot is meandering, full of surprises and ironies, and touched overall by a sense of what i'd have to call neighborliness in the relations and conflicts of the performers. this is a film i pull out when i want to believe in the world again.
