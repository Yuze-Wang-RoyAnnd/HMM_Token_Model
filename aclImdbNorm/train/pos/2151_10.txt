funny. sad. charming. these are all words that floated through my head while i was watching this beautiful, simple film.<br /><br />it is rare that a movie truly moves me, but "shall we dance?" accomplished that with grace to spare. gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie-viewing history. it left me with a quiet sense of exultation, but with a small touch of sadness mixed in.<br /><br />and the dancing, oh yes, the dancing. even if you are not a lover of the art, or can't put one foot in front of another, the steps displayed here will take your breath away, and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can. it was absolutely enchanting, even the parts that show sugiyama's (touchingly portrayed by koji yakusho) stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous, child-like way. and yet, this film was not entirely about dancing, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. we witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art, and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast.<br /><br />beauty. pain. emotion. all the love and little agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture.<br /><br />
