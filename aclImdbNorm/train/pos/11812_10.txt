this movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel. the sets, costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book. this is the movie i think of when the mob is mentioned, the suits, the hats and the attitudes.<br /><br />hoffman gives comic relief as mumbles and you can't help but feel sorry for madonna as she tries, and fails, to win tracy over. this movie contains all the classic mob clich'es - burying people in concrete, blowing up peoples cars, tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house.<br /><br />this movie is a classic in ever sense of the word, even camera angels cry out comic book. its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as spawn and the hulk. <br /><br />!!!you have to see this movie!!!!
