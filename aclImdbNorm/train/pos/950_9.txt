the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of dickens' classic tale. george c. scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast. his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie. then his character changes to one who is truly repentant. the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film. it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and it's a wonderful life.
