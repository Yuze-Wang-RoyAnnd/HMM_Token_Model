who doesn't know largo winch in the france-belgium-luxemburg trio (the three countries where the french "bd" or "bandes dessin'ees" are massively published) ? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, it had to be adapted on screens. after a first - and failed- attempt with a tv show, the real thing begins.<br /><br />first of all, and that's what most of the fans didn't get, the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. as a 1st class-fan of the comic book, i must confess i was nicely surprised. the actors are good, so is the scenario, though it might seem too fast. i thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financial/political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series as i could read over the internet.
