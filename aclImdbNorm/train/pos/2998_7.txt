enjoyed viewing this film on tcm and watching a very young william powell, (philo vance) playing detective just like he did with myrna loy in the "thin man series". back in the 1930's william powell played in the philo vance series and in this picture, the famous veteran actress mary astor, (hilda lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder/suicide case where a man named, archer coe, (robert barrot) is found dead and archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside. ralph morgan, (raymond wrede/archer's secretary) gave a great supporting role and was the brother to frank morgan who appeared "in the wizard of oz" 1939. eugene palette, (detective sgt. heath) appeared in quite a few of these philo vance films and also gave a great performance in "robin hood" with errol flynn. always remember, the least likely actor could very well be the killer. enjoy a great classic from the past.
