**attention spoilers**<br /><br />first of all, let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the 90's. it was an amazing achievement for all those involved, especially the acting of liam neeson, jessica lange, john hurt, brian cox, and tim roth. michael canton jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. but alas...<br /><br />it constantly, and unfairly gets compared to "braveheart". these are two entirely different films, probably only similar in the fact that they are both about scots in historical scotland. yet, this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that "braveheart" is a better film than "rob roy". i like "braveheart" a lot, but the idea of comparing it to "rob roy" is a little insulting to me. to put quite simply, i love "braveheart", but it is a pale shadow to how much i love "rob roy". here are my particular reasons...<br /><br />-"rob roy" is about real people.<br /><br />let's face it, the william wallace in "braveheart" is not a real person. he's a legend, a martyr, a larger than life figurehead. because of this depiction, he is also a perfect person, never doing wrong, and basically showing his scot countrymen to the promised land. when he finally does fail, it is not to his fault. like jesus, he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most. he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much.<br /><br />the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective. but it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me. i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection. that is why "the last temptation of christ" is a better film than "king of kings", and that is also one of the reasons why i think "rob roy" is better than "braveheart". rob roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones. now sure, not bearing false claim against the duke of argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness. let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act. but rob did the best he could, and that was all you could ask of him.<br /><br />rob's wife mary, is also a normal, ambigious person. let us start though, with how she looks in this film. sure, she's beautiful, but she doesn't wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show. compare this with the two loves (or one, depending on your point of view) of william wallace in "braveheart". now these two ladies are hot, but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time (especially the lay persons). maybe not a fair comparison, but just another example of how rob roy's attempts for accuracy are far more effective.<br /><br />throughout "rob roy", mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion, cunningham. she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle, but doesn't because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape. such revenge would surely mean the death of rob, and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice.<br /><br />the villains in "rob roy" are equally as compelling. although the enemies in "braveheart" are well written, they are hardly original. robert the bruce, a man both brave and cowardly, is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm. should he take his claim as the king of scotland, or should he betray wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name? bruce is the most ambigious character in "braveheart", but from brutus in "julius ceasar" to fredo in "the godfather part ii", these types of characters are hardly original. longshanks, although a compelling villain in his own right, is very one dimensional. he is the epidemy of evil, and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to wallace's heroism.<br /><br />"rob roy" has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery. first of all, let's start with marquis of montrose. he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image, that he's willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it. "see to it that i am not mocked" are his favorite words to his "factor". he is a man obsessed with power, upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him. he is shamefully self obsessed and insecure. he is an evil aristocrat, but in ways that make him unique.<br /><br />cunningham and callarn are the conspirators in "rob roy", and are also roy's direct assailants. callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical. he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis, which includes backstabbing and trickery. cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis. he needs a father, little does he know that the marquis is his real father. therefore, when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from callarn, he grabs it without even questioning it. he is very much like the evil of modern man, so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others.<br /><br />many have criticized tim roth's performance in this film as overacting. hogwash i say. it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film. in a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement, is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character? we live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life. "rob roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed. it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion. rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will prevail, but snakes will always exist in our world.<br /><br />another character that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll. he is a true nobleman, and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis. he appreciates the bravery of rob roy and mary, and has a direct vexation for the marquis and his factor. he gives the world hope for the people of power. hopefully, people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule.<br /><br />- the final duel in "rob roy" is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in "braveheart".<br /><br />one thing i get tired of is people telling me that "braveheart" is a better film because of the battle scenes. first of all, battle scenes are hardly original. from "spartacus" to "gladiator", hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes. "braveheart" has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film, but they suffer from one important problem. these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom.<br /><br />now, don't get me wrong, duels are hardly original either. in fact, there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes. but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold. it is one of the greatest scenes in film history. let me explain why...<br /><br />first of all, the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. cunningham is effette and dangerous, rob roy is strong and courageous. cunningham uses a fencing sword while rob uses a broadsword. cunningham fights with quick tricky movements, while roy's fighting style is more obvious.<br /><br />the whole film, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half, is leading up to this moment. it is powerful stuff, and it is clear that rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world. when rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively,) it is one of the greatest moments in film history. rob wins because he has more to live for, and his honor is more powerful than 10 cunningham's. the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell "freedom!". but hey, maybe that's just me.<br /><br />- "rob roy" is more realistic than "braveheart"<br /><br />i don't know that people in the aristocracy or scotsmen talked like the people in "rob roy", but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. i feel that many people are bored by "rob roy" simply because they can't understand what the characters are saying. if this is the case, then read some shakesphere, or put on the close-captioning. "rob roy" is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90's. many of the dialogue in this film is clever, but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it.<br /><br />by contrast, the dialogue in "braveheart" is hardly very interesting. of course, what do you expect when the main character is a scotsman played by an australian? this is a legend, and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times. this film takes place several centuries before "rob roy", and yet they talk like the people today. thus the reason that many people like it better. audiences today have become increasingly lazy, and they don't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex. therefore, as with many epic films, they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our american language. sure, it is clear that the wallace is scotish, but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of "aye"s for acknowledgement, the scots in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe scots should sound.<br /><br />so, do these descriptions prove that "rob roy" is a better film than "braveheart"? hardly. but if it proves one thing, it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that "braveheart" is a better film than "rob roy". to put simply, "rob roy" is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today's world. "braveheart" is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. you can make a decision on what you think is better...<br /><br />grade - a score - 9
