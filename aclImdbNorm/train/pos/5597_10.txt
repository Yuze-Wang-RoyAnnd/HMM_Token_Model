"le locataire"("the tenant")is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made.polanski stars as a trelkovsky,a timid file clerk living in paris,who answers an advertisement for an apartment,only to find that the previous tenant attempted suicide by leaping from the apartment window.trelkovsky is compelled to visit her in the hospital and there he meets stella(isabelle adjani).trelkovsky immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies and,at first,is quite pleased with having found such a nice apartment.his happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbours,who seem to be trying to provoke trelkovsky into repeating the previous tenant's suicide.this film is great.polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of dread and paranoia.plenty of brilliant moments such as the classic scene where trelkovsky discovers the previous tenant's tooth in a hole in the wall,or the fever dream where he wanders into the building's bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphics.the photography by sven nykvist is truly beautiful."the tenant" is a neglected gem.it may be difficult to track down,but it is more than worth the effort.
