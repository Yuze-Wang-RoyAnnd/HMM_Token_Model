if you loved long way round you will enjoy this nearly as much. it is educational, funny, interesting and tense. charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too much russ. ewan makes a few appearances but charley really pulls it off alone. he is funny, engaging and still a puddle of stress and doubt. great stuff!<br /><br />the series wraps up in 7 episodes. like lwr, the preparation is nearly as interesting as the race. though they cover the ins and outs of the race well, there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars, which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing. it is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this. <br /><br />the series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths. yikes. there is another extremely catchy theme song like lwr but this one is not nearly as good as the stereophonics.<br /><br />if you live in the us god knows when it will be released so buy it on amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as i did. oh, and be prepared to buy another motorbike.
