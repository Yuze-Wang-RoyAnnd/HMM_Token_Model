a sober, reflexive piece, a little miniature which blossoms into a magnificent humane pictorial sequence which goes beyond a mere dramatization for the screen. this quiet little story will hold you enthralled - if you do not have too many problems with the various spanish accents ranging from mexican to peruvian, and marisa paredes' more authentic iberian peninsular usage! garc'iadiego has accomplished a perfect adaptation from the novel: even the grand maestro garc'ia m'arquez should be proud of her superb work. and hats off to arturo ripstein who has so ably concerted the whole effort into a gem, a ruby, and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so touchingly.....<br /><br />el coronel - fernando luj'an - is waiting to get his pension, while he continues to live in his ramshackle timber dwelling deep in the colombian jungle (however, filmed elsewhere, not in colombia) with his fighting cock and his wife (in that order?). and that is all there is to it.<br /><br />but, oh, so much more.... this film is a rhapsody.<br /><br />i must see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible. worth the high side of 8 out of 10, which is very high on my scale.<br /><br />this is not light commercial hollywood stuff.
