and this is a very disturbing film. i may be wrong, but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor, who transformed the role, and delivered a message.<br /><br />jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent. they are unassuming and unaware; businessmen wanting to enjoy the country. little did they know what would happen next.<br /><br />the photography and sets are realistic and natural. this was before the days of wes craven.<br /><br />what is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist. in america, country folk still detest city people; it is almost a century and a half since the civil war.<br /><br />you will enjoy this film. it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia, which still exist. just don't drive past that to mobile, alabama; that area still has not been repaired since hurricane katrina. 10/10.
