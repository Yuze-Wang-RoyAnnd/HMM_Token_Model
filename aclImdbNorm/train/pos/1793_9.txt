i saw this movie sunday afternoon. i absolutely loved this movie. i loved everything about it, from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where mamie gummer (lila) is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love. i loved these moments because they were just so real. at first i was seriously scared because i was hoping that it would not end up like bobby, which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it. but during the middle of the movie i felt completely different. you will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see evening one more time. trust me when i say go see it!
