much in the same way frank miller and his sin city comics used black and white to express itself (and its film noir influences), so does christian volckman with renaissance.<br /><br />it is the year 2054, in paris. in the tradition of science fiction, the future is a bright, sparkling multi-teared jewel. this is a jewel in a setting of misery, inequity and darkness; bright and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath. one of these "bright" people at the top, a research scientist from a very large and influential global company (avalon), is kidnapped. the well known and efficient, captain karas (voiced by the new james bond himself - daniel craig), is assigned the task to find her.<br /><br />the plot and layout is not overly original. it is heavily influenced by film noir, gibson's neuromancer and other detective stories, along with movies like blade runner, sin city, fritz lang's metropolis and minority report. there is the main plot, surrounded by other possible sub-plots that all connect at the end. it is not hard to figure it all out.<br /><br />the movie's strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation. paris is an intricate array of levels and sub-levels. at its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure. as the city rises, so does its architectural complexity and luminescence. yet in this structure, the top does not equate with elevation of human ideals and behavior. paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white. the movie is closer in spirit with sin city (the comics) then sin city the movie was with its source material. this is done all the more easy, because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium; animation. much in the same way as a scanner darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling, so does this. the light and dark, black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as visual ambiguity. right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us. the movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time.<br /><br />in keeping with the spirit of the movie, i can be both critic and fan. i can love and loath in the same light. it is definitely an experience i recommend for lovers of the visual arts. so pour another black and tan, enter the void and enjoy the ride.
