this is a really interesting movie. it is an action movie with comedy mixed in. foxx teams up with comedian epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin. it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next. it was a well shot movie, the director used the right colors in this movie(dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feel. kimberly elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. she plays her role well. even jamie kennedy is in this movie. it's worth seeing it you haven't seen it. it's definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan. it deserves more credit than it is actually given.
