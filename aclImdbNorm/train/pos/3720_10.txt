joel schumacher made a heck of a choice when he decided on this cast and this script. the story is well written and well laid out, and this entirely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. it seemed that there were 6 "leads" and about a half dozen supporting, and by far this is the best thing about the movie, the fresh young faces of tomorrow. it has been a long time since hollywood has touched the controversial vietnam war films,which says something for the"story that needed to be told"(as stated by schumacher) and tigerland lands in that handful of top war movies period. yet it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of bozz and the others. i think anyone who just wants to see a good film with out all of the special fx, but just good, gritty drama should go see tigerland, obviously shumachers best works in the past 8 years.
