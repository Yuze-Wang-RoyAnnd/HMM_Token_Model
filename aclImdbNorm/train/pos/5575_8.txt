i didn't expect much from this, but i have to admit i was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film. if you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes, this might be a film for you. ditto if you are the type that would enjoy watching amanda peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half. it's certainly not a momentous work of comedy, but given the low-budget indy genesis this is masterful. to level the playing field for comparison, imagine all of the studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of 100 or so and see what you get! kudos to peter cohen and his network for seeing this through. i look forward to his next effort.
