it's a refreshing breath of air when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning, a middle, and a end, a nice, clever mystery, with an appealing heroine for all ages, who wins us over with her wit and charm. andrew fleming's film is indeed a modern marvel, a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in hollywood. he puts away the over-reliance on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film, with a very capable young actress, and a talented supporting cast.<br /><br />the film is based on the old books, but it has been given updated enough to put in this century; however, the props might be different, the heart still is a good mystery, and there is clever one here, one that ties the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth. emma roberts is an old fashioned girl, who believes in good behavior and respect for others; details that are sorely missing from today's films. she is still good enough to get boys' attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect. she earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little guile when it is needed to achieve her goals.<br /><br />while taking a vacation to california, our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play; suddenly she is "visited" by her ghost and this sets off a series of events that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself. what makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details, as she discovers that her customary world is nothing compared to the california scene, and this is well presented, without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual. eventually, the director has enough control to make it all very palatable to all types of audiences, from the young ones to the adults in the audience. it is a movie that deserves to be seen, appreciated, and enjoyed, a film that is rare and delicate, and it's not afraid to be classified as fun! five stars
