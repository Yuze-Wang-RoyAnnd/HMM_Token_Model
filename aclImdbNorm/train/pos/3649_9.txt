i've seen a lot of tv movies in my time as a student, the majority the normal waste of time that us television throws out. this one, however, was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end. having only seen richard dean anderson in macgyver and stargate i was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from a-b that he normally gives. it was a pleasant surprise to see daphne zuniga after quite a long time dating back to the fly ii. also nice to see robert guillaumme in a leading role again. i can't say that i ever take jane leeves seriously after her benny hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role. all in all a highly recommended film.
