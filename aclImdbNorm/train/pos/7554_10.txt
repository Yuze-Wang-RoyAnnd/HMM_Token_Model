first of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies. second of all--you need to do this. this sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images. cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eating their own fried flesh--that's only the beginning. the scenes and images, extraordinary on their own, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re-watching. furthermore, the dvd includes an amazing director's commentary, which, given the extremely spare dialog, only enhances the viewing. the commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes, but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of cat soup, along the lines of: "well, the artists were asking what we should do in this scene, but i didn't know myself, so its hard to say why it turned out as it did" (that's a bad paraphrase by the way). also, the sound throughout the film is very high quality, very precise, and very moody. in all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows:<br /><br />first viewing: watch the dvd without the commentary. second viewing: watch the dvd with the commentary. third viewing: rewatch without the commentary.<br /><br />once you've watched it three times, however, you're not going to stop there...
