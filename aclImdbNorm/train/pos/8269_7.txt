i've been intrigued by this film for a while, in part because of the extremely high score here on imdb -- a 9.0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film! how had i not heard of this film before this website? well, you can't always trust the ratings. this is actually a very good film, preserved quite well if the fine vhs transfer i rented is any indication -- excellent acting by the principals, especially william haines as brown, and good location work at cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic harvard/yale football game -- but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926. obnoxious, self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place, becoming in the process a caring, self-sacrificing friend; i doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels, the predictability factor is high. still, it starts out very well, and is certainly deserving of being remembered, if not praised to the heavens. maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly harvard men...<br /><br />edit now 600+ voters and the score has actually climbed to 9.2! seriously, folks, there is ballot-stuffing going on here - i defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than "metropolis" or "the general"!
