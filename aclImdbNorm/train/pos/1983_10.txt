i saw this recently on a cable channel. the movie is great; it's one of the few musicals i have seen that doesn't shy away from the light and dark. it portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a lot of the squalor. some of the set piece dance sequences so much is going on, i didn't know where to look next. one day i shall go and see this on the big screen, just so that i see what's happening. but what really lifts this to another level is oliver reed's performance as bill sykes. not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else, some inner demons. he gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything. it was almost as if the sykes character was on the edge of madness, just awaiting the trigger. i have seen the robert newton's bill sykes from the 1948 movie, and i thought he was 'just' a bad egg, but oliver reed's performance intimidated me in my own living room.
