i saw this film earlier today, and i was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters. it didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary (the part i liked best). the leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls i know.<br /><br />all in all, a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films.
