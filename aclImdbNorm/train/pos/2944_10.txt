this is hands down the greatest stand up show ever. i've seen a lot of stand up shows ,been to a lot of stand up shows, and watch bet's comic view, but i have never seen anyone who could match the skills of murphy on this show. the impressions are excellent, the skits are great, and the timing is perfect. you can even tell the crowd gets really into. when he did raw a few years later it was also really good, but this is # 1 in my book. also shows that at one time, particularly the early-to mid eighties, that murphy was funny. my favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family barbecue and "ice cream !!! mooommmm!! the ice cream man is coming !!!!" another great part is where his mom is like clint eastwood.
