what i loved about the on-screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel! great film! as an avid reader, i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation. you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film.<br /><br />ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar. however, i think the canadian actress (christine horne) chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise. i haven't seen any of horne's previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance.<br /><br />i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008. i can't wait to see it on the big screen again!
