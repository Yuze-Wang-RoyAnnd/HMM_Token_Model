ten years after the first movie, james belushi, one of the most gifted, and over looked light comedic actors of the last twenty years, returns as detective dooley for this movie.<br /><br />if you are expecting more of the same from the first movie, you will be disappointed, but this is still a good movie. realizing that all the dog vs. man battle of wills scenarios had probably been used up in the first movie, this one turns slightly more psychological in its approach as it concentrates on a criminal with a fixation with dooley's recently deceased wife after she rejected his book, and blames dooley for her death.<br /><br />the script may not be the best, but the movie allows both belushi and christine tucci to show their good acting ability, while still retaining enough of the light humour of the first movie to make it work, and the chemistry between the two stars is there for all to see.<br /><br />an easy, light going movie, which, while maybe not worth a purchase unless you are a true fan of either the first movie or belushi, definately worth a watch when it comes on tv.<br /><br />
