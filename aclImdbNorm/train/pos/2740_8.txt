tremendous black--and-white nighttime cinematography, and plenty of it, highlights this supposedly-true life account of a 1950s murder in kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men.<br /><br />the story was written by truman capote, so you get the very liberal anti-death penalty message at the end of the film, which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case. robert blake and scott wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family. <br /><br />despite the annoying slant at the end, this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating. famed photographer conrad hall did a fantastic job on this. it makes me wish more modern-day films were made in black-and-white. see it on dvd.<br /><br />blake, wilson, john forsythe, jeff corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here. my third viewing of this film came in early april of 2005, shortly after blake, in real life, was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife. one can't help but look at blake and this film differently after that.
