this was the most costly film, when produced. sir alexander korda and h.g. wells were both distressed by its poor ratings---for good reason. it was and remains far ahead of its time. aside from the seemingly poor direction, probably editing, at the very beginning, the work moves along to a stunning conclusion.<br /><br />whether its sir ralph richardson's 'boss' role, or even better, his wife's, sir cedric's, as adversary to space-faring, raymond massey's 'john cabal' center role---all deliver mind-boggling performances.<br /><br />the scene with mr. korda's incomparable set, of the small girl-child, running out to an absolutely 'never-to-be-matched' scene, commenting 'life just keeps getting lovelier and lovelier'? that swiftly brings tears to any parent/grandparent. this is not a film for the young--unless 'experienced' and rather those who have seen 'the horror' it opposes.<br /><br />sure, the 'phony-parachuting', looks hokey---while using a 'magnetic-cannon', now termed 'mass-driver' may be viewed as ridiculous, vs. rockets---give sir korda a break--mr. wells made that choice. and at +/- $8 million, this film went way beyond 'over-budget'---so he concentrated on what he could manage.<br /><br />the true power of this greatest of cinema rests in 'john cabal's' final statement of human destiny---his friend 'passworthy' doubts the wisdom of space-faring, saying, 'we're such little animals.' john cabal's proper response is,(paraphrased) 'yes, little animals, and if that is all we are, we must live and die as such.' they are standing under a large astronomical telescope. he sweeps his hand over the night sky. 'yet we may have all the universe, or nothing.'---then the final chorus breaks in---'which shall it be?'---this is not 'star wars', 'blade runner'---anything you may consider 'great'---this is the real thing.<br /><br />i remind all of steven hawking's most recent address, upon his latest 'medal of honor'---'humanity must leave earth, or die.'---the very core of this work---i love 'standard entertainment'---yet this 'relic', for the wise viewer, offers far more. 'which shall it be?' be in the proper 'mood'---whatever that takes---this will take your breath away---i 'guarontee'---overall, for humanity? the most significant of cinema. <br /><br />since posting, i note many have commented on the poor 'media-quality' of 'surviving' examples. in the 80's i developed a 'proprietary' 'colorization' process which required a 'clean' original. this led me to michael korda, who sadly noted all were gone---so we must relish what remains---'sad but true?'
