i like david hamilton's artistic photographs of nude women at the border of womanhood, sometimes erotic, though never pornographic. someone else liked them, too, because my david hamilton books were stolen. in one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy, obviously nude, intimate with a young woman older than he, also nude. though discrete, there was strong sexual connotation. new territory for david hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie tendres cousines or perhaps photos taken on set.<br /><br />the art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography. soft focus becomes out-of-focus and discrete angles become confusing, perhaps because, in motion, they cannot be considered. you either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe, to comprehend. the movie is supposed to be a farce, and funny things do happen, but it doesn't "hang together," perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what's going on. eventually, the 14-year-old julien has intercourse with his cousin, but it's soft core, with no genital contact shown on camera. since it's a farce, we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and, having caught them, julien's father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience. in fairness, the film is in french and conforms to french cinematic forms, which may just be too subtle for most americans even with english subtitles to help us phillistines along.<br /><br />it's been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from today's climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem. nobody in their right mind wants to endorse or appear to endorse the sexual abuse of children, so there's practically no room left for children to be seen in even the mildest erotic context without immediately activating alarms over sexual violence and exploitation. guys will think "lucky julien!" even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a "bad thing," all the while still wishing they could have been a julien at that age. women, too, may have similar thoughts, but all such considerations must be pushed out of one's conscious mind. hysterically, the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided. too bad, since sexual awakening is a real human experience. afer all, children do grow up and become sexual beings as julien does. it's a fit literary subject, cinema included, but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children. david hamilton, i think, was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in 1980. he was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic, and, unfortunately, we're unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label.
