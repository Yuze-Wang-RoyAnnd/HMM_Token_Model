when i first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. i'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall. the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes. most of the attitudes came from soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. soll is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then. i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer's disease. none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. while he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black. the two convicts he trusts most are jackson(mel winkler) and ben(james earl jones). the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hass.<br /><br />this movie should have gotten more notoriety. however it's on dvd and worth the money.<br /><br />rayvyn
