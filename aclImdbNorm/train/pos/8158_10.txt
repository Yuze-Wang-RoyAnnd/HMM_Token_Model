"fear of a black hat" is everything the (much weaker) "cb-4" should have been. rusty cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless, as he folds, spindles, and mutilates every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture. does "foabh" resemble spinal tap? yes, a bit. is it derivative of spinal tap? no, not really. the aim is more focused, the satire is better focused, and to be honest, it's funnier.
