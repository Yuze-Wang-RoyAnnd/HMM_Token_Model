contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. they are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women. i can't say the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in just how typical they are. the themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship, and sacrifice.<br /><br />i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting. i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse. the actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a thrill to watch. i'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. it's a great example of both.
