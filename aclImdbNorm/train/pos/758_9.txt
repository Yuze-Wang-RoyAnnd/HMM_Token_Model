i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass, and i saw one or two episodes on freeview, and it is the same, only more extreme. basically three welsh guys, and one mad british bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding, and a complete disregard/masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety. they have had puking, eating pubes-covered pizza, jumping in stinging nettles, naked paint balling, jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping/snoring, stunts in a work place, e.g. army, cowboys, and many more insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, maybe not just for themselves. starring matthew pritchard who does pretty much anything, lee dainton also up for just about anything, dan joyce (the british one) who hardly does much physical stuff and has a ott laugh, and pancho (mike locke) who does a lot, but is more popular for being short, fat and lazy. it was number something on the 100 greatest funny moments. very good!
