the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks, that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy. <br /><br />in case you don't want to read further down the page (there aren't any spoilers), i'll sum it up here: it's more mature than ella enchanted (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds. think of it as a bit more serious, bit more magical princess bride, and you'll be close. <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />i am, perhaps, not as prodigious a movie goer as others... maybe once or twice a month, if i feel active. i'm also a huge sci-fi/fantasy fan. i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is the diamond in the rough.<br /><br />by the end here (august), i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust. having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction, the previews of stardust seemed appealing, but i was certainly wary.<br /><br />as many others here, i was utterly surprised. i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clich'ed from here to breakfast. don't be fooled, it is most definitely a fairy-tale, and it does indeed have witches, magic, and utterly requires suspension of disbelief... but the most refreshing thing i found, is that it's not based on anything i've seen or read in the past 15 years, and it's actually a really good movie.<br /><br />((unlike 90% of the other movies which seem to persistently re-appear like thorns in a side, perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas? i could read a book this year, and in two years the movie would be out as another "epic fantasy tale, the likes of lotr and the rest" so says the nyt and such and such no doubt.))<br /><br />stardust didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was i sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom. it didn't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen (transformers, i'm looking at you). it's not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques, nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could've figured them out in 3rd grade (boy i hate those). <br /><br />i just... watched. watched, and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes. sure, i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film, but it makes you forget that. it even made my heart twinge at some parts, but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i'd gone in.<br /><br />it truly is a gem. after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations, this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money's worth.<br /><br />it's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (princess bride, black cauldron, the dark crystal, etc.) then you should really see this movie. this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores, you can trust me on this.<br /><br />simply wonderful.
