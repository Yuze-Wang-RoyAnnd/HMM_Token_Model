one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from atlanta. the idea of living the chulawasse river before it's turned into a lake comes from burt reynold's lewis, who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare. but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie, the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story, with our men forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. in very bad ways. at the end of the movie, each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week-end on the river but muted into a fight for survival. the movie (except some pretty evident goofs) is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath. the photography is excellent as well. voight, reynolds, cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake.
