...here comes the romeo division to change the paradigm.<br /><br />let me just say that i was blown away by this short film. i saw it, randomly, when i was in boston at a film festival and i have thanked god for it every day since. i really, truly believe i was part of a happening, like reading a tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of mean streets.<br /><br />i am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products, but i so hope i can be there for it.<br /><br />again, a truly incredible piece of film making.
