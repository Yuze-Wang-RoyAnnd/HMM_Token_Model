the only show i have watched since 90210! why did they discontinue it? it was the only show that captured the essence of hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all! the least they should do is release it on dvd! <br /><br />i checked out similar shows, but nothing has come close. the cast had incredible chemistry and i looked forward to each episode with much anticipation. <br /><br />they made a big mistake by pulling that show. if anyone has any info regarding where i can obtain a dvd of north shore please post a few lines here. thanks! aloha!
