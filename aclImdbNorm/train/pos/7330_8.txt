this movie is based on the art of frank frazetta, the mythical fantasy illustrator. some of the characters are straight out of his paintings (the death dealer being the best example). surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art. bakshi is well known for his heavy use of rotoscope (the technique of tracing a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. however, since the subject of the movie is quite realistic (all characters are humans), this works pretty well.<br /><br />but what i really like here is the plot: for once we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences, a really hideous villain and a gorgeous babe. this movie has the feeling of the best conan comics, not surprisingly since roy thomas is the writer of the marvel series of our favourite cimmerian! this is a far cry from the crappy live action conan, not to speak of all the b-movie of the genre.<br /><br />definitely recommended!
