when i first saw this movie, the first thing i thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie. the reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. the stunts are very much like the matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far. another reason why i the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie. the way gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act, very anime. i think that it's a really good movie to watch. ^_^ the action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention gackt and hyde too are a 10). ^_~ if you are gackt and hyde fans, you have to see it.
