the sensuous nurse (1975) was a italian sexual comedy that starred the one time bond girl ursula andress. man was she hot in this movie.. she was stacked and built like a *@#% brick house. ursula was smoking hot in this movie. i have never seen a nurse's outfit that filled out before. <br /><br />ms. andress stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man. even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots. one night, the nurse decides to take the grandson's temperature and give some needed t.l.c. to her ancient client. the old man takes to his nurse and this angers the rest of the family. what kind of job did the family hire her out to do? will the geezer fall for her car giver? how can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family? to find out you need to find a copy of the sensuous nurse!! italian but badly dubbed into english.<br /><br />highly recommended.
