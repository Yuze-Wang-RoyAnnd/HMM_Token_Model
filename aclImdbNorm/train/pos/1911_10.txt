i love the newer episodes with cj and grandad - i also liked the storyline with kate falling for the principal. i want to find out what happens to rory and kerry and bridget and the family next. i think cj is very funny and i love his scenes with grandad. i have always loved james garner in everything he does, and it is a credit to his acting that i never think of him as james garner or rockford in this series and totally believe in him as kate's dad. this family is so real and funny. it was terribly sad when john ritter / paul hennessey died, but as in real life these things happen and the way it was written into the series and dealt with was both funny and sad and always extremely sensitively and lovingly dealt with. but generally a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun.
