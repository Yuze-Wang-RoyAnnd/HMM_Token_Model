michelle rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging force for other actresses to look out for. she has the audacity to place herself in a rarely seen tough-girl role very early in her career (and pull it off), which is a feat that should be recognized. although her later films pigeonhole her to that same role, this film was made for her ruggedness.<br /><br />her character is a romanticized student/fighter/lover, struggling to overcome her disenchanted existence in the projects, which is a little overdone in film...but not by a girl. that aspect of this film isn't very original, but the story goes in depth when the heated relationships that this girl has to deal with come to a boil and her primal rage takes over.<br /><br />i haven't seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in movie-making yet, and i'm glad that she's getting that original twist out there in hollywood. this film got a 7 from me because of the average story of ghetto youth, but it has such a great actress portraying a rarely-seen role in a minimal budget movie. great work.
