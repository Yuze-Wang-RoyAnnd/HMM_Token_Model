a tour deforce! ok the kid that plays oliver is a bit toooooo sweet! starting with the great cinematography, color, costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie. i have seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot! it is a masterful fagan, never leaving his character to do a song. you never really know if you like him or not, the same feeling i got in the book. in other versions you hate him from start to finish. bill sykes.... when you read the book hes a mean one, and so he is in this movie. oliver reed was masterful. his wife directed this masterpiece. i went and saw his last movie, gladiator based on his many fine performances, not to see the headliners. the music fits the times and the mood. who will buy this beautiful movie? you should!
