this low-budget erotic thriller that has some good points, but a lot more bad one. the plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife. being a soft-core film, that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects. as plots go for this type of genre, not to bad. the script is okay, and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 am watching this not to notice too many plot holes. but everything else in the film seems cheap. the lead actors aren't that bad, but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad (one girl seems like she is drunk and/or high). the cinematography is badly lit, with everything looking grainy and ugly. the sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying. the worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it-the sex. the reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe diary situations. the sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy, shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it. the woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot. i'm not trying to be rude or mean here, but they all have that breast implants and a burned out/weathered look. even the title, "deviant obsession", sounds like a hardcore flick. not that i don't have anything against porn - in fact i love it. but i want my soft-core and my hard-core separate. what ever happened to actresses like shannon tweed, jacqueline lovell, shannon whirry and kim dawson? women that could act and who would totally arouse you? and what happened to b erotic thrillers like body chemistry, nighteyes and even stripped to kill. sure, none of these where masterpieces, but at least they felt like movies. plus, they were pushing the envelope, going beyond hollywood's relatively prude stance on sex, sexual obsessions and perversions. now they just make hard-core films without the hard-core sex.
