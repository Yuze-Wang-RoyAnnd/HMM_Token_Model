diagnosis murder has been shown on most weekday afternoons on bbc1 since i used to watch it while ill from school a good 10 years ago - i know i shouldn't really enjoy it, in the same way i shouldn't enjoy 'murder she wrote' but i'm totally addicted to both and even have the dvd box-sets....ok i know that's sad!<br /><br />dick van dyke carries the show as he stars as dr.mark sloan a doctor at community general hospital in l.a who is also a police consultant for the l.a.p.d. - his son steve (barry van dyke - dick's real life son) is a police officer, who needs his father's help on very many suspicious deaths. <br /><br />along for the ride is dr.amanda bentley (victoria bentley) the resident pathologist at community general and for the first couple of seasons you had scott baio playing dr.jack stewart, who upped and left the series in 1995 hoping to go on to bigger and better things...he should have stayed where he was, he hasn't done anything of note since....and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in baby geniuses 2:superbabies....oh dear!!!<br /><br />anyhow dr.jack stewart was replaced by the younger dr.jesse travis played by charlie schlatter who stepped into baio's shoes pretty comfortably.<br /><br />the series is highly implausible but what whodunit series isn't? (murder she wrote - everywhere jessica goes, someone ends up dead, or the underrated father dowling mysteries about a murder solving priest with nun sidekick)<br /><br />the series was much lighter up until 1997 this is because it had a supporting cast that included the bumbling hospital manager norman briggs played by michael tucci along with nurse & mark's secretary dolores played by delores hall, after 1997 both these characters were no longer included and the series became a grittier affair with a bigger looking budget, some episodes included far more action, one episode the entire hospital is blown up.<br /><br />this was a family show for the van dyke's because as well as dick's son barry, you also had dick's daughter and all his grandchildren making an appearance in various episodes. <br /><br />as the series went on it got a bit silly, one episode i remember dick van dike plays his entire family, which was a bit out of the ordinary, but on the whole 'diagnosis murder' was a really good tv show which had numerous good guest stars.<br /><br />since this show finished in 2001, dick & barry have appeared together again in the 'murder 101' series of tv movies made by the hallmark channel, pretty much following the same path, and still enjoyable. dick who's now in his mid 80's doesn't seem to change a great deal, and looks as if he'll be working till the bitter end.<br /><br />tv show **** out of *****
