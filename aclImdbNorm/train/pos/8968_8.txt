this movie was like any jimmy stewart film,witty,charming and very enjoyable.kim novak's performance as gillian,the beautiful witch who longs to be human,is splendid,her subtle facial expressions,her every move and gesture all create gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character,she left us hanging on her every word.i should not fail to mention ernie kovacs' and elsa lanchester's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(kovacs) and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to.the romantic scenes between stewart and novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great,but then again when is the chemistry between jimmy stewart and any leading lady bad!
