i just came back from hong kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of zu. i thought it kicked a*s! it was so creative and unique. it's the crouching tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama. even if some thought there was too much special fx(yeah right!), you can't complain about the cast. zhang ziyi and cecilia cheung are so fine!!! the legend of zu.....kicks a*s!!!!!!!!
