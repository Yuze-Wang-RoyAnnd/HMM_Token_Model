i watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it. i loved it. a very good, tight plot, an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly, fat, deaf girl and the ex-con, and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried. <br /><br />a much, much better film than the same director's de battre mon coeur s'est arret'e, which was boring and unbelievable.<br /><br />the only thing that didn't quite work was that the supposedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from conventionally beautiful, but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it. superb. i wish she was in more films, and better ones than she generally is. i've seen a bit of gilles' wife and a bit of the moustache, and they both looked like rubbish, and i've seen all of de battre mon coeur s'est arret'e, and that certainly is rubbish. she seems to have a few coming up, so i'll keep my fingers crossed.
