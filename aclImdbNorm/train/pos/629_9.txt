the 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with lord of the rings, harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office. this year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably the golden compass, which has the most exciting trailer i've seen this year. stardust, based on a novel by neil gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. i saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. the critical reaction is kind of blah. i wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because i went to see stardust, and i loved it. it's not a huge movie like lord of the rings. the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. but within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. it's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. and it succeeds wonderfully. there were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. there's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. it isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has (though i don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). a lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.
