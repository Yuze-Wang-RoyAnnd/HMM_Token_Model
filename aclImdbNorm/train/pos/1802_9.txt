okay, i saw this movie as a child and really loved it. my parents never purchased the movie for me, but i think i'll go about and buy it now. i'm a sucker for pre-2000 animated films. anyway, onto the actual review.<br /><br />what i liked: there was an actual portrayal of heaven and hell, one of the few i've seen in animated films. character development existed! it's easy to classify characters in this movie (i.e.: charlie is the selfish mutt, itchy is cynical but believes charlie, carface is obviously the relentless villain, etc.). i also loved king gator's song. i've always loved loud, annoying, flamboyant guys. this song may have been random, but it was so fun. finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. you could tell charlie was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful.<br /><br />what i did not like: the actual portrayal of heaven: the way charlie reacted to it, "no surprises whatsoever", made it actually seem very boring. he denied a place in heaven and still got to return to it in the end. i remember a few lines of certain songs such as "... you can't keep a good dog down", "... let's make music forever", and "... welcome to being dead" but i can't remember the majority of any of them. the songs weren't that catchy, to be honest. whippet angel: she's annoying and that neck! augh!<br /><br />what parents may not like: a few very scary (depending on the viewer) images of hell are shown during the movie. carface is quite threatening. beer is also implied, but not actually dubbed beer. gambling is a key element in the movie. the good guy dies.<br /><br />overall: i love this movie, even if it is a bit forgettable at times. the scarier children's animations are always my favorite ones. this was created back in a time when producers and writers weren't afraid to give kids a little scare now and then. nowadays, this probably would have been rated pg. kids under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed kids) should not watch this. other than that, i give it 9/10. :)<br /><br />happy viewing!
