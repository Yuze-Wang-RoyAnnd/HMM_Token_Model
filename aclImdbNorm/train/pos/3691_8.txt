the whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts. no problem. this film features a line-up of some of the most diversely creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast. the segments are devised around the same theme, "love in paris", but the resemblance ends there. actually, considering that the approach to the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms, it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film. no great effort has been made to turn it into a comprehensive whole. this buffet has so many great ingredients, i am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish.
