the ogre is a film made for tv in italy and wasn't intended to be a sequel to demons as lamberto bava even mentions it on the interview on the sheirk show dvd, but it was called demons iii to be part of the demons series. the music in demons and demons 2 was 80's rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror demons iii: the ogre is a architectural horror so that's how demons iii isn't a proper sequel to demons but i still like this film.<br /><br />the music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in, the ogre is another thing why i like the film. there are two other films that are classed as demons iii and that is black demons (demoni 3) and the church (demons 3). demons iii: the ogre is a good film as long as you don't compare it with demons and demons 2.
