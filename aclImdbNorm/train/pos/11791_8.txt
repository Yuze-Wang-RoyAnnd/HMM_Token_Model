this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch, and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people. this is your typical lynch short. a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. the blonde has been crying, the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde, and that's about it.<br /><br />with a lot of silent moments, but with the haunting music from angelo badalamenti, there is a strange form of suspense. this short feels a little like 'mulholland dr.', a movie i loved, and therefore i liked this one as well. it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this.
