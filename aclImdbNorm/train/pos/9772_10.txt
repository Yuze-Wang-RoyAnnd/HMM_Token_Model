theodore rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time, and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression!! in this compelling intellectual masterpiece, jonathan r. betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century, such as francis ford copola, martin scorcese, orson welles and roman polanski. the special effects are nothing less than breathtaking, and make any work by spielberg look trite and elementary. at the time of it's release, theodore rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film-making to levels never anticipated by film makers. the concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur, but adapting an action packed, thrilling detective novel, co-staring a "talking" dinosaur with a post-modern name such as "theodore", and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it. the world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty. watching theodore rex is much akin to looking into the face of god and hearing him say "you are my most beloved creation." this is one of the few films that is simply to die for!!!
