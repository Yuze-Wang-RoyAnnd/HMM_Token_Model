this is one to watch a few times. the excellent writing shows they had to have lived this story or know someone whom did because they nailed it. freebird made me relive and laugh at my misspent youth. the title was a great choice. great film, setting, story, soundtrack and characters. it's a biker flick but would be a shame to pigeon hole it that way. funny to the bone, kinda like trailer park boys in the u.k. if you've never seen tpb, make a point to if you like this film. you will thank me. i hope to see more of these characters in other films. sequel? could be done. there's a whole lot more of the world i would like to see through their eyes.
