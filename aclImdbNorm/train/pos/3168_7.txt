this is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference. kyoko is a beautiful japanese woman who has run to california to escape from a failed relationship in japan. ken is a japanese american manual laborer with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner. kyoko "marries" ken in order to be able to stay permanently in the u.s., with the understanding that although they will live together until she gets a "green card" the marriage will be in name only. it soon develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same "time zone", hence the title of the movie. as an immigration attorney i have seen such "arrangements" take on a life of their own, so i was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
