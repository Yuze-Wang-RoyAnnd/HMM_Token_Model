i have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as jonny kennedy. i never got the chance to meet him but i have never heard anybody say a bad word about him. i hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition. this man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not. i believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools. i also agree with other comments - what have i got to moan about? he took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour. god bless. i couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being changed. i have enough trouble with my son's.
