in the hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town, partied pretty hardy. after all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the usa. <br /><br />the drovers who worked for trail boss gil favor as played by eric fleming were no different. but fleming was a man of all business, he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it. <br /><br />with the long run of rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with it for the most part, we got to know all the drovers at some point. a some point story lines were focused around all of them, though the bulk were with fleming and clint eastwood's character rowdy yates, the number 2 guy with the herd.<br /><br />clint eastwood's western image was molded by rawhide, it's a shame that these are not shown more often. probably because they were done in black and white. had this been an nbc show, this would have been done in color like bonanza and be running as often as those shows are. we'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend.<br /><br />ironically enough it was eric fleming who left the show before it closed to do films. he did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name. sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film, drowned in a river. had he lived he might have become a name like eastwood's.<br /><br />clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run. and he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre.<br /><br />rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it. no frills in this one, these were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year.<br /><br />they really don't make television series like these any more. what a pity.
