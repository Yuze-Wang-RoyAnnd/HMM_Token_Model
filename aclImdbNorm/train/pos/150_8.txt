the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community, develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty. whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level, caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male-prostitute, villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco. the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis.<br /><br />the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar's work with themes dealing with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic, gritty realism opposed to almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar.<br /><br />the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing.
