after "a dirty shame", i never thought that i was going to see another john waters movie. that movie was really so bad, that i was convinced that all his movies would be like that. but when the dvd of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie, i decided to give it a try anyway. only a couple of days later it was shown on television. i taped it out of curiosity and now that i've seen it, i can tell you that this "pecker" sure is a lot better than "a dirty shame".<br /><br />in this movie we see how a young 'nobody' from baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of new york. he's a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby. when he keeps his very first 'exhibition' in the shop where he works, his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness. his photographs are sold for enormous prices, but when he sees how his family, friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to new york, they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him. and they do, but what they get to see there, is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine...<br /><br />it's not difficult to see why i loved this movie a lot more than "a dirty shame". the first reason is that this movie has an actual story. this movie really has something to say and isn't just intended to shock as many people as possible. the fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they don't know what the reality is like, isn't just funny, it's not that far from the truth either. i guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way. nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it, but apparently we are all supposed to like it. the second reason why i liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer. i'm not saying that everything that you will see is great, but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like edward furlong, christina ricci,...<br /><br />overall this isn't a great movie, but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes - which never really go too far - this is an enjoyable movie. it certainly isn't the best comedy ever, but i liked it a lot more than "a dirty shame". i give this movie a 6.5/10.
