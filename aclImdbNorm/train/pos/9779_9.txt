three horror stories based on members of a transgressive hindu cult that return home but changed in some way. in the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who wants to find out about what went on at the cult. somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on chairs and face each other. reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants. what seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story. things get quite bloody.<br /><br />second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy. the patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task. again, things slow down a bit and get weird. then there's a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising.<br /><br />final story deals with spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the persons illness from them with his hands. one of the patients is a former cult member, so the successful healing gets more complicated. again, we are surprised by a twist. has a pretty gory scene in there.<br /><br />there some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason. i found the stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath.<br /><br />note: review of the german dvd.
