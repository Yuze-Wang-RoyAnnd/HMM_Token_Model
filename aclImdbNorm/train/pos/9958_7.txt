i watch them all.<br /><br />it's not better than the amazing ones (_strictly ballroom_, _shall we dance?_ (japanese version), but it's completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts.<br /><br />i am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting. for example: the "name should scream don't watch. 'how she move.' since when can movie titles ignore grammar?" <br /><br />there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar. it's just not canadian standard english grammar. comments about the dialogue seem off to me. i put on the subtitles because i'm a canadian standard english speaker, so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it. it wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so american.<br /><br />i loved that this movie was set in toronto and, in fact, wish it was even more clearly set there. i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast. i enjoyed the stepping routines. i liked the driven mum character. i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies.<br /><br />in summary, if you tend to like dance movies, then this is a decent one. if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking, your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie.
