eddie izzard is genius with his non-stop humor. i could listen all day. his unique approach to life is quite logical. his understanding of discovery (such as the heimlich maneuver) is creative. eddie izzard captures the heart of what we think. i don't know when i laughed so hard at anyone's off-beat mind.
