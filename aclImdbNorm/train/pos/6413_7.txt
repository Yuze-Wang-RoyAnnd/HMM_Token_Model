robert de niro, cuba gooding jr., hal holbrook, and all the rest of the actors and actresses in "men of honour" have combined to make this a fine movie. mark isham wrote the filmscore, so you know the music is truly fine, too.<br /><br />but: after noticing a slew of goofs, loopholes, and over-dramatic heart-string pluckings right from the start, i had to make a vow to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film. if you can do that, it _really_is_ good.<br /><br />the story of carl brashear, a true-to-life hero, is inspirational enough to last a lifetime. look him up on the internet... the entire story is more amazing than the film, as the director admitted in his comments. there were only three african-american u.s. navy divers in world war ii. however, none reached the status of u.s. navy master diver. carl brashear was the first african-american u.s. navy master diver. and he was the first amputee diver to ever be certified or recertified as a u.s. navy diver. (resounding applause).<br /><br />on the negative side of the movie's ledger: should i tell you of only one of the many "loopholes"? yeah, i'll mark this comment as containing "spoilers" and do so... the early, pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea: they'd never have had the time to suit up a full mark v diver, even if he were the legendary master chief billy sunday, in time to be only "... a couple of minutes late" saving the pilot.<br /><br />so, for loopholes, goofs, and over-dramatization, i derated "men of honor" from a perfect 10 down to a 7.<br /><br />will hollywood ever realize that the unalloyed truth is so much better that their over-dramatic approach to story-telling? i doubt it. too bad!
