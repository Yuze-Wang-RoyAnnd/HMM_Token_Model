this film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever. ever. but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest. the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless. i bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain dvd's at my local pound shop. me and some friends then watched it, admittedly whilst rather drunk. it soon occurred that this wasn't any normal film. instead a priceless relic of what will probably be james cahill's last film. at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered. instead we watched the film right through. at the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream, something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours, whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons. we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed, this wasn't a work of abysmal film. this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at. this was a film that anyone can enjoy. this was genius.
