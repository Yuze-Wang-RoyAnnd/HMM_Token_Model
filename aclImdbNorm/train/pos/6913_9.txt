as a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesn't take acting too seriously, i'm always amused by those who treat it as great art. this movie skewers the "actor's craft" mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs.<br /><br />a ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator. when the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "the part of a lifetime" by the neo-nazi head of the secret service. he plays it to the hilt, gets the dictator's girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa, and turns the tables on his captors beautifully.<br /><br />lots of great shtick by the leads, lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors, particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard, and fun little cameos abound. sammy davis jr. makes light of himself, jonathan winters plays a semi-retired american businessman with something else going on, and raul julia, sonia braga, and above all richard dreyfuss are exceptional.<br /><br />this is a dumb movie, but it has lots of beautiful locations (in brazil), a humorous script, and good actors doing their thing and looking like they're actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play-acting!
