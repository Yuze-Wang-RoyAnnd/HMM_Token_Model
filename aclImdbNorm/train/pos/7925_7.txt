silly movie is really, really funny. yes, it's got its dead moments, it can be a bit too obvious, it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess, but it's laugh out loud funny all the way. and it's worth seeing just for ed mcmahon as a right wing kook. this movie is in the same class as elvira, mistress of the dark, another incredibly funny, underappreciated film.
