william hurt may not be an american matinee idol anymore, but he still has pretty good taste in b-movie projects. here, he plays a specialist in hazardous waste clean-ups with a tragic past tracking down a perennial loser on the run --played by former pretty-boy weller-- who has been contaminated with a deadly poison. current pretty-boy hardy kruger jr --possibly more handsome than his dad-- is featured as weller's arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving. natasha mcelhone is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable & high-cheekboned love interest for hero hurt. michael brandon pops up to play a slimy take-no-prisoners type whose comeuppance you can't wait for. the coca-cola company wins the product placement award for 2000 as the soft drink is featured throughout the production, shot lovingly on location in a wintery picture-postcard hungary.
