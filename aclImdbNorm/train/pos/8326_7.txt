while fred schepisi's "i.q." doesn't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing. walter matthau plays albert einstein, trying to help mechanic ed walters (tim robbins) fall in love with princeton mathematics doctoral candidate catherine boyd (meg ryan). probably the funniest scene is when dr. frizzyhead and friends (lou jacobi, gene saks and joseph maher) try to make ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a french impressionist.<br /><br />obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. it's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (the shawshank redemption). a movie about einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the scottsboro nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the fbi kept a file on him).<br /><br />so anyway, this one is acceptable. also starring stephen fry, tony shalhoub, frank whaley, charles durning and keene curtis.
