this movie has recieved horrible ratings from just about everyone who has voted here but i am here to say if you like movies like dude wheres my car and dumb and dumber this movie is for you. if your into movies like citizen kane and casablanca id have to sugest you in a different angle. yet i still love this movie and everything about it even if it is kind of "kiddy" this is one of the few movies me and my freinds have been able to keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible. great movie. this movie should the afis number 1 because its so friggin' high class. the only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was a made for tv movie on a channel that no longer exists. so i dont know how to get this movie, id like to buy it for dvd but i cant find it anywhere. i still have it taped from when it was first on, you can come over if you want and watch it bute i might be sleeping. this movie rocks and thats basicly all you need to know.
