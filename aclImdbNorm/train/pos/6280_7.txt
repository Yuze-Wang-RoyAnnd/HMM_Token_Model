if you like cars you will love this film!<br /><br />there are some superb actors in the film, especially vinnie jones, with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance.the others are not bad either....<br /><br />there are only two slight flaws to this film. firstly, the poor plot, however people don't watch this film for the plot. secondly, the glorification of grand theft auto (car crime). however if people really believe they can steal a ferrari and get away with it then good look to them, hope you have a good time in jail!<br /><br />when i first read that nicolas cage was to act the main role, i first thought "...sweeet.", but then i thought "...naaaa you suck!" but then finally after watching the film i realised "...yep he suck's!".only joking he plays the role very well.<br /><br />i'll end this unusual review by saying "if the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired them to change their ways, then this death carries with it an inherent nobility. and a supreme glory. we should all be so fortunate. you can say "poor criminal." i say: "poor us."<br /><br />p.s. - angelina jolie voight looks quite nice!
