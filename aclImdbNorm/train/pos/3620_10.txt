i just saw this movie tonight, opening night. it was great!! i'm a big fan of sports movies, and this was right up there as one of my favorites. dennis quaid was great. (oh, by the way, mr. quaid, if you read this...my sister lives in austin, where you live.....and she was supposed to buy you a drink once...well...she kinda stood you up...but she didn't mean to! :c) [not that anyone's going to believe that...]) anyway, it's a great movie. everyone who likes a good sports movie, should go out and see it! :c)
