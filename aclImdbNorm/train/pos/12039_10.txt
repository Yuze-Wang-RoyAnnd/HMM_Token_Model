the woman in black is fantastic in all aspects. it's scary, suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life. i first saw this on the tv back in 1989, and with all the lights off and the volume turned up, it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life. i managed to get hold of a copy, and now, i make sure to bring it out every halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members, who have no idea what they're in for, and all i can do is laugh with glee. as for the film:<br /><br />it starts out with a young lawyer named arthur kipps, who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of crythin gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client - mrs. alice drablow. <br /><br />this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story. but then, arthur attends the funeral, and from that scene on, we do not feel safe. we are constantly on edge and biting our nails, and that goes on for the next hour or so, until the final, thrilling finale.<br /><br />a warning to all new viewers though: do not watch this alone...
