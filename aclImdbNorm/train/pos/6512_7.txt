my baby sitter was a fan so i saw many of the older episodes while growing up. i'm not a fan of scooby doo so i'm not sure why i left the tv on when this show premiered. to my surprise i found it enjoyable. to me shaggy and scooby were the only interesting characters *dodges tomatoes from fans of the others* so i like that they only focus on those two. however, this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it. i like the voice acting, especially dr. phinius phibes. i liked listening to him even before i knew he was jeff bennett. and jim meskimen as robi sounds to me like he's really enjoying his job as an actor. i also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play dungeons and dragons or act out scenes from star wars (not called by those names in the show, of course).
