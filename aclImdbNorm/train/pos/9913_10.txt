in addition to being an extremely fun movie, may i add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. this kind, fun loving woman had a great deal of money. unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money. this woman was lonely since the death of her husband. he had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down. to prevent that, she bought it. her daughters were afraid she was throwing away "their" money and decided to take action. the character actors in this film were a great plus also. i would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library, but as of yet, it's never been released. sad.
