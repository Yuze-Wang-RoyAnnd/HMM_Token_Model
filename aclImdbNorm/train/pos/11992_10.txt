ever since i remember, i have loved airplanes and flying. i am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking to become a commercial. i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me, this was it. my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid. i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re-cite it today. it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd's soon! it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless. i cannot get enough of this show.
