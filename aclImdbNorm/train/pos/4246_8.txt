in this film, made just as the production code was being enforced, jean harlow is eadie, and patsy kelly is the wisecracking, man-chasing sidekick "kitty". girl from missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train, with eadie making a promise to herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband, staying whole-some in the process. it doesn't take her long to meet up with frank cousins, (lewis stone, was the kindly doctor in grand hotel, as well as judge hardy in the "andy hardy" films.), but all is not as it seems...the censors must have loved harlow's line "a girl couldn't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged." later, someone says "you know we've never been alone together" and eadie replies "yeah, and we're not going to be!" lionel barrymore is t.r. paige, another rich, uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for eadie. at one point, paige declares "you oughta scratch me off your list - i'm not a ladies man".... i wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the hayes code came rolling into town. what was he really saying? carol tevis seems to be the high-pitched "baby talker" as listed in the credits on imdb. looks like she was only in showbiz from 1931 - 1939, with "munchkin" in wizard of oz being the last part she played. fun, cleancut romp as the girls chase men around the country. look for nat pendleton as the lifeguard, who was an olympic wrestler 1920 (silver medal winner) turned film star (he was in many of the dr. kildares, and would appear in four of harlow's films.) mistaken identity, plot twists, a young franchot tone, love stories, even jean harlow in a bathing suit in "palm beach", although the outdoor scenes of downtown appear to be a backdrop.
