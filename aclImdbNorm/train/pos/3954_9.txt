whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie i've ever seen, i invariably reply "black noon" and to this day nobody's ever heard of it.<br /><br />i watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening. as far as i know its only ever been shown once in the uk and sadly is unavailable on dvd or vhs.<br /><br />if anyone can trace a copy please let me know.<br /><br />if i watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film!
