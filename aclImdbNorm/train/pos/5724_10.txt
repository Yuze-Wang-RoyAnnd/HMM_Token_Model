massive multiple chills down the spine! i'm surprised there's people who didn't like it! i saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff! and i've seen hundreds of thrillers/horror movies! for crying out loud,i'm 22!!! i mean, ok, voice acting, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish. but the genuine look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! from the very start, hitting you again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorising scenes! so many clich'es yet none fails to surprise/scare! you know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, boo! and you still jump off the chair. grab a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night! hats off to the japanese!
