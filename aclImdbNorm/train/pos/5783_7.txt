i've read reviews of kerching on imdb, and frankly,i've not seen one positive review, until now. i actually like kerching. kerching is about a teenage boy named taj lewis, in order to make lb1,000,000 for his mother, he sets up a website called rudeboy. the website offers a lot of interesting things, if only taj, and his 2 friends - danny and seymour can stop taj from getting exposed. i find this show quite funny and i enjoy watching it. the acting is o.k., but it can definitely be better, the characters are funny, especially danny spooner, taj's friend , his stupidity is what makes him funny. and taj's other friend seymour. also carlton, the owner of the caf'e'e called "the chill." we never see him, we only hear him. taj's younger brother omar, and his older sister missy is funny too. and missy's best friend kareesha. so many times taj's has almost got exposed, almost. as well as the comedy, the drama in kerching such as love life and the loss of loved ones makes this programme great.
