i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary. the musical score, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an imax production. even though it is shot for those huge imax theaters, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. in fact this would make a perfect dvd to demo your system.<br /><br />the subject is also so fascinating. it is about mario andretti and his son michael. i was already a fan of mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the cart championship, f1 championship, the daytona 500 and the indianapolis 500. the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son. the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection. the other car is michael's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season. imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating.<br /><br />paul newman, who was michael amoretti's team owner at the time this movie was made, narrates the film. his anecdotes and witticism, drawn from many years as an owner and driver, lends much to the production.<br /><br />the main feature is the race scenes. turn up the volume here! there is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget. wow!<br /><br />the final magical element is the humanity of the andretti family. this god of the racing world, mario andretti, is loving father who proudly watches over his son's career. they work together so well that every father and son should see this. you can tell that they are a close family. i wish we could all have that experience.
