shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of, the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect, certainly much more true to the peter o'donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films. you can read the strip currently in the reprints from titan books, or in comics revue monthly. it is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time. the movie isn't great, but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got, and it holds your interest. on the dvd extras, the interview with quentin tarentino, who is obviously stoned, is a gas. some people have faulted tarentino for associating his name with the film, but without him it would never have been made. he is a modesty blaise fan, and picked a good writer and director. all things considered, worth 8 stars.
