attractive marjorie(farrah fawcett)lives in fear after being accosted by a lone biker. she is mortally shaken with the fact her attacker knows her address. as expected, joe(james russo), the attacker forces his way into marjorie's home and subjects her to humiliating terror. bruised and bloody, marjorie manages to get an upper hand on her attacker, knocking the living daylights out of the jerk and renders him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eyes and throat. hog tied and battered himself, joe tries to explain himself to marjorie's roommates(diana scarwid and alfrie woodard) when they get home. there is almost a hint of mercy, but it is not coming from marjorie. should she continue to render her own punishment? violence, sexual abuse and rough language makes for an r rating. fawcett really gets away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career. kudos to director robert m. young.
