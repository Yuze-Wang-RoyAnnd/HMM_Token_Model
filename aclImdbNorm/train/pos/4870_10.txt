the movie celebrates life.<br /><br />the world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has "happy end", just like in the closing scene of the movie.<br /><br />the movie has wonderful soundtrack, mixture of serbian neofolk, gypsy music and jazz.<br /><br />this movie is very refreshing piece of visual poetics.<br /><br />the watching experience is like you've been sucked in another colorful, romantic and sometimes rough world.<br /><br />like mr. kusturica movie should be.
