i just have to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. i cannot even count the number of times i've seen it. i was already in love with john travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to gilley's, i was in awe. debra winger, as always, delivers a perfect performance as the young, naive wife of bud, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. if you're not a country music person, which i wasn't, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word. if you get a chance, please see this movie-it won't disappoint.
