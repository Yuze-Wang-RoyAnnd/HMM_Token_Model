i really enjoyed this episode. seeing the flash, cyborg, green arrow, and aquaman (even though all he did was swim) made my eyes widen. to see most of the founders of the justice league trying to bring down lex luthor is what i've been waiting for. this sounds a bit off topic, but making a live action justice league show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode. this is the thrill i got from watching this episode. i wish they had made this episode a little longer, like a two hour special, because i felt that one hour of the justice league wasn't enough. now before i bore you (unless i already have with my rambling) i just want to say, smallville is cool again. it sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on lana. but i'm sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole. :( so enjoy this episode. who knows when another good one's going to come out. catch it again this thursday, feb. 22, if you missed the first airing.
