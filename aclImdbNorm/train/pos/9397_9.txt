vaguely reminiscent of great 1940's westerns, like "the treasure of the sierra madre" (1948), "red rock west" is a story about conscience, greed, and betrayal. michael (nicolas cage) is a down and out, but honest, young man from texas who goes west in search of work and money. he finds both, but not in the way he had expected.<br /><br />the film's screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists. excellent cinematography, adroit film editing, and moody western music add tension and suspense. the expansiveness of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting. and the acting ranges from good to excellent, with great performances from dennis hopper and j.t. walsh. dwight yoakam's specially recorded country/western song provides the film with a strong finale.<br /><br />correctly labeled as neo-noir, "red rock west" strikes me as being something else, as well. the plot is full of amazing coincidences and improbable timing, so much so that others may regard the screenplay as flawed. ordinarily, i would agree. in this case, however, when combined with the moody atmosphere, and the fact that the small town of red rock seems almost empty of normal daily life, the coincidences and unlikely timing suggest a story that, beyond "noirish", is ... surreal. it's almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with improbable events so as to force michael to come to grips with himself. from this point of view, the coincidences are not script flaws at all. they are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters.<br /><br />all we need here is rod serling, in a postscript, explaining, in his always clearly enunciated voice, that ... a young man, searching for himself, stops in a small, almost deserted town a thousand miles from nowhere. it's his final layover in a journey to ... the twilight zone.
