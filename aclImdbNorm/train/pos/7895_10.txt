in the opening scenes of this movie a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another man's bathroom and blew out all the lights. this must have been very hep for 1936, but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film, robin hood did not make an appearance as far as i could see. however, bette davis(daisey appleby),"the whales of august",'87 was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in hollywood. daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and so called swim suit on her yacht with george brent(johnny jones),"the spiral staircase",'46. daisey even proposed marriage to johnny in a ferris wheel upside down and even got a black eye. davis and brent made a great couple, one suppose to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter. off stage, davis and brent were having a real torrid love affair, which is good reason why there was sparks when these two appeared in this film. if you liked bette davis and george brent, this is the film for you!
