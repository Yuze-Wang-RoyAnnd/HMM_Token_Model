in my honest opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. it really put things in perspective as i watched it. though it was fictional, this movie is about something that could happen to your children.<br /><br />it shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school, and their plans to murder innocent students. this film would not have worked in any other format. they pulled off the hand-held camera, perfectly.<br /><br />it reminds us of april 20th, 1999, when eric harris, and dylan klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves. it also reminds us of the media storm that followed after. everyone wanted to see the rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes.<br /><br />this movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true. we get to see the kid behind the monster.<br /><br />the only bad thing about this movie, is that it did not do well on the market, and few people even know it existed. if it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie, everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about, zero day.<br /><br />i believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it. the shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film, because it mostly focuses on cal and andre, and what they did up to that point.<br /><br />if you have not yet seen this movie, go rent it, and watch it. i guarantee that when it is finished, you will be speechless.
