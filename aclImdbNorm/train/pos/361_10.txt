like i said at the top, four stars just aren't enough. it's one of the best films i've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life. for the people that don't really like it or understand it, you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention span.<br /><br />even if i haven't seen all his films yet, i'd have to say that this is spielberg at his peak. it's pretty sad to see that movies as great as "the color purple" don't come along too often 'cause i think all of us are in desperate need of first-class motion picture entertainment in these hard times.<br /><br />movies like this are more than just movies; they're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more.<br /><br />the idea that it was nominated for 11 oscars (even best picture of the year) and didn't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes. spielberg wasn't even nominated for best director! it should have swept the oscars that year.<br /><br />the film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people.<br /><br />if only movies were still this good....
