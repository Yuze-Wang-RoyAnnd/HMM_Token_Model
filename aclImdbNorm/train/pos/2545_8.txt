the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi. karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even his wife. his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid.<br /><br />lugosi plays the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends. this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. it is hard, however to hear his accent and believe he is french. <br /><br />the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on "junk science" but, in a way, even the junk science makes it work well. since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are as "relevant" today as they were when the movie was made. and they are also as forward reaching- and always will be. <br /><br />this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again. i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times. the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing. i highly recommend it.
