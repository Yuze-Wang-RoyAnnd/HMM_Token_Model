creep is a straight up serious horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to just show people get attacked in a empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. and it does just that. nothing more, nothing less. director christopher smith draws out the drama a far as he plausibly can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked. he also leaves the origins of the titular creep deliberately vague (unlawful experiments happening in the 60s underground are hinted at) and that little bit of mystery works for the most part. sadly, he undermines himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations would appear (they are hinted at as well). yes, you heard me right - i wanted a clich'ed twist ending! franka (run lola run) potente is good as the terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine.
