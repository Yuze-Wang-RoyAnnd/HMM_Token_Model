midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969, drawing an x rating. by today's standards, it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating. jon voight, who has been better, is competent in his role as joe buck, an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city. he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo, who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes. the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic. as ratso, dustin hoffman simply shines. hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more so than in this portrayal. he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison. losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences. director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production, but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. worth seeing for hoffman's performance alone.
