"party girl" capitalizes on the tremendous charm of parker posey. in fact, at times, the movie seems to be a vehicle in which ms. posey is allow to play herself, as she normally is in real life.<br /><br />the film, directed by daisy von scherler mayer, is a treat for ms. posey's fans. ms. von scherler mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents. this is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent meat market districts became. at least, there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that way.<br /><br />parker posey makes an amazing mary. it's because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played mary. she is the whole picture. the rest of the cast is good.
