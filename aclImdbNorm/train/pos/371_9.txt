i remember when this film was up for the academy awards and did not win in any category. for the life of me, i cannot remember what it was up against, but one thing i can say: it was one of the best movies i have ever seen. and the fact that steven spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit.<br /><br />essentially, it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. there are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. whoopi goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie. danny glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film. <br /><br />and the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely, not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent "beloved" did. i encourage anyone of any race to see this film. 9/10
