jack frost is really a cool movie. i mean....its funny. its violent. and very enjoyable. most people say that it is b rated, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. it has great special effects and good acting. the only weird thing is of course, the killer snowman. i think this movie was actually one of the best films of the late-nineties. most films these days lack the criteria of a clive barker master piece. that is, be original and give the viewer what they do not expect. jack frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. grade: a+. ed also recommends the movie uncle sam to fans of jack frost.
