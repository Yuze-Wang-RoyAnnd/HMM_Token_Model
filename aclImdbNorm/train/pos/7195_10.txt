i loved this exiting republic serial! the story was one of the best i have ever seen! even tough, the picture quality was not of the best, but ok. the fencing in this serial is also a bit bad, but not terrible. they only should have practised some more. as i said the story is great! you're just sitting there and waiting to find out who don del oro is! the theme music is excellent! it's the same guy who maid the music for walt disney's version of zorro, who maid the fightin legion music. costumes and buildings are very good. zorro is really cool and so are the legioners! i highly recommend this serial. buy it! <br /><br />i love that reed hadley plays zorro! he is funny, smart and brave! mark: 6.
