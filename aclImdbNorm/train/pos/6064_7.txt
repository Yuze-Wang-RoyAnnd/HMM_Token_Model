i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie.it was winter time in alaska around the year 1990.a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment.winters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors,drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television.i had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure.it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever.we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish.we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect.it is a true gem.the laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever.if you see this movie for rent in a video store,steal it.you won't regret it!
