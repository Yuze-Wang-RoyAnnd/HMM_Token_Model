i have never danced flamenco before, but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect. the colors, how blatant the dances were, the gypsies, and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon. i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agree that this film may be his best production. i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make iberia. i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras. while watching this movie i felt like i was sitting in a small restaurant in madrid, comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail. for me, this movie fit like a glove. i don't know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years. i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures. it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list.
