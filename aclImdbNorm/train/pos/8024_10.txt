when i first saw this film in the 1980's, i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the "sesame street/muppets" age. i honestly don't remember if i liked it at the time or not. however, somewhere in college i watched this film again, and it wound up going (and staying) into my personal best films ever collection.<br /><br />this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets. i mean, obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there's humor geared towards both generations. but come on...janice is accidentally overheard telling someone "i don't take my clothes off for anyone, even if it is artistic"...there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father doesn't want to hear it...gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and afterwards says "i think we're engaged now"...these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling. add to that very smart dialogue, very smart new york/broadway "wink wink" humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don't border on "kid-level cheesy" whatsoever...this film is a masterpiece! i don't throw "10"'s out on a regular basis...but this one deserves it. over 20 years later, this film totally holds up, perhaps even more so. the muppets never were and never will be again, as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is. ---q
