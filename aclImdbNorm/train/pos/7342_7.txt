i won't claim to be a fan of ralph bakshi, because i am not. i have only watched 5 of his animated films so far: coonskin, wizards, fritz the cat and lord of the rings and finally "fire and ice". what i can claim, is that i found "fire and ice" to be the most enjoyable of the lot. it is a straightforward fantasy tale of swords and sorcery along the lines of conan the barbarian, but the beautiful artwork, realistic animation and lively film score effectively lends a very classic charm to this movie.<br /><br />deserving first mention, is the animation itself. i do not care what people say about rotoscoping but in my opinion ralph bakshi used that technique very effectively here. i was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were. the style of directing and the photo-realistic character designs made "fire and ice" feel more like a big budget fantasy blockbuster than a cartoon. sadly the level of art detail tends to get a little inconsistent, especially near the end of the movie. some scenes just look really flat with little to no body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters.<br /><br />with realistic moving characters, realistic action would naturally follow. not only was the action well choreographed, but it was really brutal. i would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like zack snyder's 300. i did notice however that though there was blood shed, the blood splatters were kept to a minimum. again, a great choice by the creative team that only heightens the viewing experience by not taking things too "over the top".<br /><br />though i do not recognize any "big names" in the cast, the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance; keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only hamming it up in the case of the bad guys.<br /><br />did i say bad guys?? yes i did. because that is exactly what the story is about, a standard good vs evil tale. nothing really original about the story which seems to merely be a mix of pre-existing fantasy film clich'es that involve scantly clad warriors and maidens. anyone looking for "depth" would be sorely disappointed. the characters are not given much development and some of them like nekron and darkwolf are one dimensional at best(i did however hear rumor of some deleted scenes that explains darkwolf's obsession with killing nekron and his mother. scenes like that deserved full restoration and should have been included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show). in fact, i would not be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a "tech demo" of sorts to showcase the awesome animation and art, with the story cobbled together and thrown in as an afterthought in order to pass it off as a proper "movie".<br /><br />a true classic of a bygone era, "fire and ice" really captures the blazing spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful renderings of fantastic creatures and charming characters. it is a unique vision of a world created by ralph bakshi and artist frank frazetta with a good measure of action and suspense. <br /><br />would it hold up to animated film standards of today? definitely not. but i urge animation fans in general to "get off your high horse" and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow on you. it is truly a gem of the 80s worth checking out.
