the story is being told fluidly. there are no interruptions. the flash backs are woven into the present seamlessly. casting was superb. young ya'ara looked very much like ya'ara would have looked at that age. her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly. director daniel syrkin have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story. the cinematography is very good. you feel like you are with ya'ara and talia walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff. the english subtitles follow the hebrew script very closely. it is interesting to note that even though "out of sight" is not a direct translation of "lemarit ayin" both names are very appropriate to the story.
