this film was on last week and although at that time of the day (around 6pm) the quality of the movies is almost never good (at least here on mexican tv), i couldn't switch the tv off. the story about madelene moore really touches you. she doesn't come across as a very sympathetic character at first, but seeing the whole film, you just want her so succeed. this film really leaves you thinking. and i think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson. i had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film, but this was great great acting. compliments to brooke. i hope to see her in another film soon.
