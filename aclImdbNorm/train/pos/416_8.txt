the plainsman is an entertaining western, no doubt a classic, which is actual even today. gary cooper is wild bill hickok, ideal for the role, together with john wayne and james stewart, they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation. jean arthur is great as calamity jane, nobody that i know played it better than her. even if might not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important about hickok and about the time it takes place. sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here. the friendship of hickok with buffalo bill, the selling of rifles to the indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war, custer and little big horn, the uneasy relationship between buffalo bill's wife, a religious woman, with hickok a man who had killed plenty, also the unusual love affair between hickok and calamity all this makes 'the plainsman' a non conventional and interesting film. anthony quinn has a very short appearance, that already shows what a great actor he was going to become. a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time.
