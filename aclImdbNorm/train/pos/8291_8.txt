"the lady in question (1999)" starring gene wilder is a well-acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white raymond burr perry mason series. both perry and "cash" kept me guessing right up to the end. there were many suspects with a motive for the murder, but i had no idea which character it would be.<br /><br />gene wilder has a special charming wit about him, even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part. the portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well. i'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off. i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie. even his singing was a delight. i like him in this role more than his former "sillier" roles like "the young frankenstein" and "willy wonka." i am hoping a & e will continue this series. they ought to call it something like "the a & e gene wilder mysteries."<br /><br />the music fit the period. i enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes. i was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period. and i do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script. to me, that always distracts.<br /><br />overall, my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well-crafted start in what we hope will be many others -- just like one of our other favorites: raymond burr's perry mason.
