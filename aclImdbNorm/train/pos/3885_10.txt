i was first introduced to "eddie" by friends from "across-the-pond" who know i like intelligent humor. i prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as george carlin and dennis miller. in 'dress to kill' eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time. there is a wide range of subjects in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. the piece on how to decide on englebert's stage name will leave you in stitches!<br /><br />thanks andrew and catherine! ... and "do you have a flag?"
