i would just like to state that this may be biased, as i am a producer on the film. however, i will maintain some sense of dignity.<br /><br />the star of the film, oscar ovies, gives a stellar performance as jeff grinderlin, a nebbish hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living. he brings a certain touch to his character that really allows the audience to connect with him, by stating his mind often and with a sense of harsh comedy. his mother, played by christine haber, is the constant support beam, that without, he would crumble upon himself. his friends also lend a hand in jeff's life, often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will... which often times he neglects is there anyway. <br /><br />the writing is superb, and the conversations flow like scenes from a kevin smith movie, with half as much ben affleck boo-hoo fests.<br /><br />the camera work is a little shoddy at some points, and the sound could also use a boost, however the performances out shine the minor details. it is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer.<br /><br />all in all, this was a treat. a rare gem, among many jewels.
