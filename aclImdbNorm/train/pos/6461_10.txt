first i was caught totally off guard by the film's initial lyricism and then i became totally enchanted with the unfolding story and engrossed with the brilliant directing. the characters were all fully developed, not bigger-than-life but just like the people we live among anywhere we are in the world, in sweden, in turkey or in america, all completely believable human beings with foibles and nobility. hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful film. it shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action to bring out the whole theme clear and bright, and that shows the brilliance of the director! hearfelt thanks to kay pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat!!
