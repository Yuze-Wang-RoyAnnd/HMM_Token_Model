will smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to right his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts!!! writer grant nieporte and italian director gabriele muccino come together and created a masterpiece that i highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching/feeling this film!!! i have the highest respects for will smith as he is not only a brilliant actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (irs agent ben thomas) he played in this film. you will find yourself feeling his pain and anger, the frustrations over his love for emily, played by rosario dawson, who by the way was fantastic as usual. i found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love. woody harrelson also stars in this top notch film. i find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points...all i can say is, watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to interrupt you, take the phone off the hook, sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of irs agent ben thomas...i thank you will smith for another great film!!!
