soylent green is...a really good movie, actually.<br /><br />i never would've thought it. i don't really like heston in his sci-fi efforts. he's one of those actors who, like superman, manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time. i prefer more vulnerable heroes. and indeed, he sneers his way through much of soylent green, too, but as he's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully i don't really mind.<br /><br />i can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie. soylent green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks just like 1973), and it's lacking in action. but i admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt, and highly stratified society, and i was so pleased to see that edward g. robinson had such a moving, funny final role. nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with heston - really make the movie.<br /><br />the message of soylent green is pretty relevant these days, when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to. funny, isn't it, to see heston in a prototype michael moore movie...
