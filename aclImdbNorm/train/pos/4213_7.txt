director samuel fuller concocts a brilliant visual set-up: cocky pickpocket unwittingly lifts some microfilm from a woman's purse; it turns out she's a courier for the communists, and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police. the film noir formula is all its glory--before the ingredients became clich'es--including waterfront locales, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack, and one hell of a climactic fistfight. performances by richard widmark and jean peters are right on target, and the smart, sharp script is quite colorful. fabulous thelma ritter received an oscar nomination for knockout supporting role as a "professional stoolie". exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails. *** from ****
