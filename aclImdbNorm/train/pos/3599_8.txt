this movie is a real gem. the arc of the the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives completely believable. the dialogue is fresh, and oh so real. the situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed. until the climax, that is. then it's as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable. but i don't want to discourage people from watching this film. the first 3/4's of it are truly remarkable. i gave it an 8. there are some remarkable performances here. check out this movie.
