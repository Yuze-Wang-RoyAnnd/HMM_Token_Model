this is a very good spanish movie but i am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the spanish civil war was all about or when it was fought. being a history teacher, i had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces. i doubt if this would be a big concern in spain where this film was made, but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film.<br /><br />the movie begins with 12 year-old carol and her mother returning to her mother's home town. years have passed and you gather that they are coming to spain from new york city. despite the strangeness, carol speaks reasonably good spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts. as for why her and her mother are alone, i'll spill it now for those who don't pick up on the fact that carol's father is fighting in the war on the side of the republicans (who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict).<br /><br />the movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music. the rather slow and rambling pace isn't bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way. i have seen several other spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to them--not better or worse--just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flick.<br /><br />ps--if you don't know which side is which, the republicans were mostly socialists and they were backed by the soviet union and mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the usa). the nationalists were led by franco and were aided by portugal and the fascist states of germany and italy.
