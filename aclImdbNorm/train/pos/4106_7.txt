this definitely is not the intellectual film with profound mission, so i really don't think there is too much not to understand to in case you aren't czech.<br /><br />it's just a comedy. the humor is simple, pretty funny and sometimes, maybe, little morbid. some actors and characters are very similar to samot'ari (2000) (jir'i mach'acek, ivan trojan, vladim'ir dlouh'y) so the authors are. but it doesn't matter, the genre is really different and these two films shouldn't be compared in this way. jedna ruka netlesk'a won't try to give you a lesson, it will try to make you laugh and there is some chance it will succeed.<br /><br />not bad film, not the ingenious one, but i enjoyed it. some scenes are truly worth seeing.
