hilarious film. i saw this film at the 2002 sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival, and laughed from start to finish. the acting was subtle but very funny. i'm not entirely certain about "the real world" influence, we don't get that here, but the film holds up without the understanding of that show. heather b steals every scene she appears in, most notably when acting with her seldom talkative red co-star. highly recommended. i'd love to see this released on video/dvd some time in the future.
