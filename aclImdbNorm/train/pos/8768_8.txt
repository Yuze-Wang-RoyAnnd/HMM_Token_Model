i saw this film at a store in the cheap section. i actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago. i thought "what the hey' and bought it, basically because the plot sounded interesting and claire danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes (this was also before i became a huge kate beckinsale fan).<br /><br />so it's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in bangkok, get busted for narcotics (which they are innocent of) and then are sent to a thailand prison. the film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence.<br /><br />both claire danes and kate beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally, and raises some nice moral discussion questions.<br /><br />i think this is a solid good film, but there could have been some improvements. it could have been longer...it would've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of thailand's justice system would've helped.<br /><br />nevertheless, other than that, it's a good film with some great performances.<br /><br />p.s. for all you pop-culture junkies be on the lookout for a two-minute role by paul walker. i didn't even notice him the first time i saw the film.
