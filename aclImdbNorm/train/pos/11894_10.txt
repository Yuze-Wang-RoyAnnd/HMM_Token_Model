a truly adorable heroine who, at turns, is surprised and terrified by giblets, wrestles with mattresses, runs full-on into closed doors ... just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of 'the naked truth'. i loved what i caught of this show: enjoyably daft plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show - tea leoni as, 'nora wilde'; cute, clownish, and wonderfully accident-prone - how refreshing to see an actress who can clown - it's no wonder hollyood doesn't seem to know how to cast her. but where-oh-where are the dvd releases? the amount of (bleep) they release, it's incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried. (someone please correct me if i'm wrong.)
