after reading the original play i thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. donal mccann puts in a once-off great performance as public gar, the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted (but unseen to others) alterego- private gar. eamonn kelly also plays an excellent "screwballs" whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by gar.<br /><br />definitely worth renting out if you can find it. (probably unavailable outside ireland & uk)
