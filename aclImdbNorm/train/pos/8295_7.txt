robert urich was a fine actor, and he makes this tv movie believable. i remember watching this film when i was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same. people lose who they were when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich californian town. urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family, and i love the halloween space suit idea, brilliant. this film is about the battle of one's sprit. tv quality, that exceeds, the big budget, gangs of new york. i wonder if robert urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie? i hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10.
