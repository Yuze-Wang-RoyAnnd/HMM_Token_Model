halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. it's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance. it is a simple movie told very well. the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores... if you haven't seen this movie yet, you must check it out. the cast is all terrific. i wish they had never made sequel after sequel. the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel. it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie. she hasn't seemed to age (she's just as gorgeous today, without the hairdo and seventies clothes). the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!
