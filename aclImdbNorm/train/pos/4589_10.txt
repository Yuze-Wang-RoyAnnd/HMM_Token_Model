well, i would consider police story as one of jackie chan's best film. the plot, the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent. in this film, jackie himself acted as a police officer called chan ka kui (kevin chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. after the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed chan for the killing of a police officer. due to this, he became wanted by the police. later on, salina (brigitte lin), who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to chan. however, the crime lord knew that salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her. later on, chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen, defeating them one by one. at the last scene, chan was seen punching the crime lord. lastly, this is the best action and comedy movie. everyone should watch it. highly recommended.
