you will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first, second or third viewing, but you?ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing, that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium.<br /><br />disney continues to firmly hold the title of "greatest animation in the world", with "a bug?s life" standing as one of their greatest achievements. one of the innovative attachments being the delightful "out-takes" added to the end of the film. the dvd has two sets of these out-takes where as i?m told the vhs cassette has one alternating version per tape. the dvd also features "gerry?s game" which is a delightful little pixar short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.<br /><br />this is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to dreamworks? "antz", which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters. if you look at the star voices of both films, "antz" is largely cast with big name "movie" stars with a few familiar "tv" star voices, where "a bug?s life" is just the opposite, loaded with "tv" stars with kevin spacey as the only stand out exception. but the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.<br /><br />dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though, when you go head to head with disney, you have your work cut out for you. this is the kind of film that almost makes me wish i had children to share it with. don?t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids, though.
