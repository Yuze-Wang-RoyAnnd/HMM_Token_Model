basically, the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two scotts(ridley and tony). let's make it straight, the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner/thriller ever made.<br /><br />when it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, denzel washington and tony scotts really make a perfect duo. both this movie and deja vu are better thrillers you can expect. washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie. one would easily be related to his character's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road. it's a success that they created a super-dark mexico city with a lot of shits happening. one would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in man on fire. i don't know what would the mexicans think when they watch this......<br /><br />well, let's face it again. it's among the best of the death wish genre, but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence. it's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let denzel washington play the "missing sheep" type of tragic hero. in the end, they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary. i was checking on imdb if the movie was based on real events for that...... so that's for your consideration if you also finds the movie's theme is a little bit phony.<br /><br />at the end, i hope one would not take this movie for real.<br /><br />8/10 for art direction/editing/cinematographic/denzel washington.
