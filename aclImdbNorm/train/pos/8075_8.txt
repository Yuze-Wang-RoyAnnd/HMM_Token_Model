i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say. even though this movie did not get the best comments, this movie made my day. it got me thinking. what a false world this is.<br /><br />what do you do when your most loved ones deceive you. it's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake, it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance. same way some people are such that they are never grateful. this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself. <br /><br />a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster. the surviving brother decides to take revenge. through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone.<br /><br />amitabh gave the performance of his life. the new actor aryan gave a good performance. the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show. her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance. chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself.<br /><br />a great movie by raj kumar santoshi. his movies always give some message to the audience. his movies are like novels of nanak singh (a punjabi novelist who's novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil) because they have a real message for the audience. they are entertaining as well as lesson-giving.
