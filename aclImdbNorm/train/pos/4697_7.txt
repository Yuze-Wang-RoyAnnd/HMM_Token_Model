michael keaton is "johnny dangerously" in this take-off on gangster movies done in 1984. maureen stapleton plays his sickly mother, griffin dunne is his da brother, peter boyle is his boss, and marilu henner is his girlfriend. other stars include danny devito and joe piscopo. keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him, in flashback, how he came to own the pet store. he turned to thievery at a young age to get his mother a pancreas operation ($49.95, special this week) and began working for a mob boss (boyle). johnny uses the last name "dangerously" in the mobster world.<br /><br />there are some hilarious scenes in this film, and stapleton is a riot as johnny's foul-mouthed mother who needs ever organ in her body replaced. peter boyle as johnny's boss gives a very funny performance, as does griffin dunne, a straight arrow da who won't "play ball" with crooked burr (danny de vito). as johnny's nemesis, joe piscopo is great. richard dimitri is a standout as moronie, who tortures the english language - but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it. what makes it funny is that he does it all with an angry face.<br /><br />the movie gets a little tired toward the end, but it's well worth seeing, and keaton is terrific as good boy/bad boy johnny. for some reason, this film was underrated when it was released, and like keaton's other gem, "night shift," you don't hear much about it today. with some performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find "johnny dangerously" immensely enjoyable.
