i was absolutely mesmerised by this series from the moment tom long walked into shot - the whole 'bad boy' thing, it was just addictive.<br /><br />the story has you hooked, what will happen next - will joey get the girl in the end, after doing 5 years in prison, and all that time thinking about his lost love, crossing paths with her again, finding he has a son... although he is a violent bad guy, you still want him to find happiness.<br /><br />a truly captivating two parter - please bring it out on video!
