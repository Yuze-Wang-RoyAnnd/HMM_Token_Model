the korean war has been dubbed americas's forgotten war. so many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50 thousand men who died there. occasionally, we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far-off, ghostly frozen graveyard. here is perhaps one of the finest. it's called " sergeant ryker. " the story is of an american soldier named sgt. paul ryker (lee marvin) who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer. his task is to defect to the north koreans and offer his services against united nations forces. so successful is his cover, he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of major. however, he is thereafter captured by the americans, put on trial as a traitor and spy. stating he was ordered to defect, he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence. he is convicted and sentenced to hang. however, his conviction is doubted by capt. young (bradford dillman), his prosecutor. convincing commanding gen. amos baily, (lloyd nolan) of his doubts, he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed. the courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes peter graves, murray hamilton and norman fell as sgt. max winkler. korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950's. due to its superior script and powerful message, this drama has become a courtroom classic. excellent viewing and recommended to all. ****
