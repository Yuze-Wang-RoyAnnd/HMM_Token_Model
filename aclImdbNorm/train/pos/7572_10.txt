i just can't believe that these games can get so much better, but they do. unfortunately i had to rent a dreamcast to play it, but even though i did beat it i can't wait to buy it for ps2. this is the only series of games that i must own all of them even if i have beaten them many times over. i hope they never stop making this type of game even if the series must come to an end.<br /><br />
