i strongly disagree with "ctomvelu" regarding jim belushi's talent. i happen to like belushi very much. admittedly, i was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene, because i was such a huge fan of his late brother john. but jim has an on-screen charm that has gotten him very far -- and he has developed it well over the years.<br /><br />curly sue is one of his earlier films -- his weight is a giveaway (ain't that true for most of us?) -- and i like the film. yes, it is touching and heartwarming, so if you're into car chases, explosions and gratuitous sex, then you might want to pass on this one -- it is a warm film of three lost soles who find each other. don't get me wrong, i am all for the three aforementioned keys to a successful film, but i also like a nice, solid tale like this one.<br /><br />and although belushi and kelly lynch deliver excellent performances, the real star of this film is alisan porter -- who is absolutely adorable.<br /><br />i don't know what happened to her career, but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball (agent? parents? herself?) should be shot. you couldn't ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this film, and yet nothing of note has been heard from her since.<br /><br />another sad hollywood story ...
