the h.g. wells classic has had several incarnations. the 05' speilburg version and the classic 53' version but only this one stays completely true to the book. nothing is changed nothing is removed.<br /><br />originally released as a 3-hour film. the director re-cut the film down to 2-hours of pure excellence. its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that "wells would be proud of" the story is as everyone remembers. martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines. the people of 19th century earth are ill-prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth.<br /><br />the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 million budget. today b-movies have larger budgets.
