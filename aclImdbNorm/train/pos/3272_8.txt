coming from the same director who'd done "candyman" and "immortal beloved", i'm not surprised it's a good film. ironically, "papierhaus" is a movie i'd never heard of until now, yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s - partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades. (not talking about iranian or swedish "cinema" here...) the acting is not brilliant, but merely solid - unlike what some people here claim (they must have dreamt this "wondrous acting", much like anna). the story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly. these unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose, leaving it up to the individual's interpretation, and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this. "pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual mix of kids' film and horror, with effective use of sounds and music. i like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie-clich'e ultra-shy-but-secretly-brilliant social-outcast girl, but a regular, normal kid; very refreshing. i am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit-like childhoods into their books and onto the screens, as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly, lonely childhood, as if that's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential. the scene with anna and the boy "snogging" (for quite a stretch) was a bit much - evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement - considering that she was supposed to be only 11, but predictably it turned out that burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed. i have no idea why they didn't upgrade the character's age or get a younger actress. it was quite obvious that burke isn't that young. why directors always cast kids older than what they play, hence dilute the realism, i'll never know.
