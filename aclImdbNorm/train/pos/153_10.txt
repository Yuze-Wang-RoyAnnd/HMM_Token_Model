this film is, in short, a cinematic masterpiece. the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child. in fact, they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium. here we see what life has wrought on each of them. one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient. another man is a hustler who has become ill. the third child, a young lady, has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium. this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche.<br /><br />this film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving. the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written. there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film. this is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience.
