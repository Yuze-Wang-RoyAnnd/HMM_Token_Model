the sentinel i was hoping would be a good film and boy i was right.a great story first of all from a novel and i thought this was an original story but i guess it wasn't and it was a very smart story. michael douglas in this film is very good and keither sutherland is too,but however it is very hard to shrug him off his role as jack bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in the sentinel than he is in 24.also another person trying to shrug off their tv role but failed.eva longeria.she wasn't that good in the film and had a back seat in the entire thing.after i saw the film i had constant dreams about the sentinel and couldn't sleep.overall sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it.
