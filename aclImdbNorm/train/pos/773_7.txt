i expected something different:more passion,drama...again another failed attempt of originality.i'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old clich'e of 'cheesiness'.15 year old teens may appreciate it though.the acting was not very convincing and the lines common,lacking any wit.still, the soundtrack was good and well adapted.i can't say that this movie is a total flop,because people do watch it but it didn't meet the public's expectations and sunk into mediocrity.so,to conclude,the production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a half,which is an appreciable thing.thus,i guess its worth seeing if you don't get annoyed
