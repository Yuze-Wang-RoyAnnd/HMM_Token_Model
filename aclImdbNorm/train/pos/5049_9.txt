i had to see this gem twice to really appreciate all of it. when a widowed father of two interrupts his two sons' sleep with a shocking revelation, they are torn between believing him and not. as the horrifying events of this tale unfold, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons, and about their destinies. with shocking twist after shocking twist, this film never allows for a lull in the plot. bill paxton plays the father, but the most notable performances are that of his older son, fenton, played by matthew o'leary and his younger son, adam, played by jeremy sumpter. this is one of the best thrillers that i have seen in a while, and you will want to watch this a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot. i give this film a 9/10.
