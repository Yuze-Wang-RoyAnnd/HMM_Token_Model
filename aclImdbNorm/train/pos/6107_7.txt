after, i watched the films... i thought, "why the heck was this film such a high success in the korean box office?" even thought the movie had a clever/unusal scenario, the acting wasn't that good and the characters weren't very interesting. for a korean movie... i liked the fighting scenes. if you want to watch a film without thinking, this is the film for you. but i got to admit... the film was kind of childish... 6/10
