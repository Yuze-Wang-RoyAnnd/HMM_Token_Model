in my opinion, this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it had been short 10 years earlier. i doubt it would benefit from modern technologies, but it would have looked much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70.<br /><br />the artists and animated did a great job. in my opinion, this movie can boast the best background art and one of the best character design. animation are extremely smooth and realistic. for the duration of the movie you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a great job. it can also boast one of the sexiest female animated characters, if not the sexiest, that beets typical anime girls with ease.<br /><br />unfortunately, there are a couple of bad thins about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the moment. first, the plot and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure movies, and is really old-fashioned by modern standards. second, due to the duration time it would benefit a lot from extra 20 minutes of dialogs. finally, the setting is not so popular at the moment.<br /><br />conclusion: a great alternative to another short story about conan the barbarian, but not to a novel.
