it is a superb swedish film .. it was the first swedish film i've seen .. it is simple & deep .. what a great combination!.<br /><br />michael nyqvist did a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown.<br /><br />frida hallgren was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him to carry on & never give up.<br /><br />the fight between the conductor and the hypocrite priest who loses his battle with michael when his wife confronts him and defends michael's noble cause to help his hometown people finding their own peace in music.<br /><br />the only thing that i didn't like was the ending .. it wasn't that good but it has some deep meaning.
