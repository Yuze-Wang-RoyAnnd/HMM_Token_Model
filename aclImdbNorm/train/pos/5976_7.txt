trick or treat, quickie review this zany romp of a film revolves around the 80's culture of heavy metal and horror movies--two things which i love dearly. so, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. plus, for no apparent reason, ozzy osbourne plays a preacher.<br /><br />this film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of "evil" heavy metal. his favorite metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing his latest unreleased album backwards. this allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sh*t helping out.<br /><br />okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? it's got a surprising number of good qualities. decent acting (including gene simmons as a radio dj), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere... all in all, it's actually a decent horror film. but what really sucks is the music. ironic, huh? well, this "uber-evil" metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, motley crue rejects on the planet--and the "metal" is little more than putrid 80's pop/hair metal. he hits all the clich'e's here, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming "rock and roll!!!" in a pitch high enough to make king diamond retch. aside from that atrocious musical representation, it's actually pretty good. 7/10<br /><br />www.residenthazard.com
