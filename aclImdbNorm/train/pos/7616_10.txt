here is an innovative television drama; which so easily blends a compelling story, brilliantly drawn out character development, humour, romance, and drama into each episode. here is a show that sings to it's own tune, whether it's audience chooses to follow or not. how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the next? where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works, that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like glue to that formula (prison break, 24, and desperate housewives come to mind) - lost takes a different route where even after achieving that plateau and that winning formula, the team of executive producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling. this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television. this is how it's so defiant of conventional tv. and this is why lost is one of the most cutting edge and innovative creations of modern television. forget the naysayers - lost is, has been, and always will be, there to appease it's cult following first and the general public next. but it's a testament to it's inventiveness that it's garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both audiences.
