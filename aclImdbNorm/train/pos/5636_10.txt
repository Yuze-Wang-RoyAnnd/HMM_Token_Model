in "brave new girl," holly comes from a small town in texas, sings "the yellow rose of texas" at a local competition, and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in philadelphia. from there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. i loved this movie. it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace. the acting was, of course, wonderful. virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding, as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and i was very pleased with the end (it seems a sequel could be in the making). kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production. quite a gem in the film archives.
