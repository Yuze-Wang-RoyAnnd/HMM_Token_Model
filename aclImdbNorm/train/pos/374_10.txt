rating "10/10" master piece<br /><br />some years ago, i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance. well, mr spielberg, i guess nothing is perfect, but this movie - together with schindler's list - is your best. even oprah acts well in this one !<br /><br />what got me most is the realism of the story and drama. stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world.
