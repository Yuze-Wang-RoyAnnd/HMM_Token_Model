sophmoric this film is. but, it is funny as all get out. it shows the "boys locker room mentality" being played by the "other side". it is good to see such tides turned and how silly they are. but that's probably not news to most women, 'cause (just ask one), "they've heard 'em all before".<br /><br />watch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight. and the other 2.7%...can you ever really please them?
