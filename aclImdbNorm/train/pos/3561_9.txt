at least something good came out of damon runyon's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the mafia. "guys and dolls," the seemingly indestructible stage musical, was captured on film in 1955 by joseph l. mankiewicz ("all about eve") in a colorful, enjoyable movie that featured an all-star cast including vivian blaine (from the original broadway show), jean simmons (whose character bears an odd resemblance to audrey hepburn in "roman holiday") and two of the all-time great leading men, frank sinatra and marlon brando, both of whom had recently won oscars for best supporting actor ("from here to eternity") and best actor ("on the waterfront") and were on the top of their game. one listen to brando singing "luck be a lady tonight" speaks volumes about where the early dylan got his voice. stubby kaye steals the show as nicely nicely johnson, who brings down the house with "sit down you're rocking the boat." the ubiquitous sheldon leonard adds yet another page to his rogue's gallery of screen gangsters. the film has a bright, cartoonish look, anticipating the pop art of the early 1960s. the characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on yiddish idioms. although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are dated, it's all great fun, and even the gentle kidding of the salvation army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion. just seeing sinatra and brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie, but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes.
