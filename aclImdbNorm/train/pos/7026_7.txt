when i was 17 my high school staged bye bye birdie - which is no great surprise, since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most-staged musical in the world.<br /><br />i was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs, as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had (deliberately) obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audience.<br /><br />so, when the 1995 version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen, i was delighted with what i saw. alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert, a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain tv series. the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles (chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part, supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl).<br /><br />but best of all, the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be (allowing for the absence of a stage).<br /><br />so, if you know the musical (and few do not), then check out this telemovie. it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered, which is good enough for me. what is better than rendering a writer's work faithfully and with colour and style?
