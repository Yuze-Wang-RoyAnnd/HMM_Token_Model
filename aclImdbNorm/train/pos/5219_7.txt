gere and danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex offenders. gere, who plays babbage, refers to them as his flock. gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out. he is training, new comer allison, to take over his job. gere sees his flock as very sick, disturbed puppies. he asks them questions that are not on the list, and tries to act like the police and solve crimes. he keeps getting warned for this behavior, hence the reason he is being replaced. during his final few days on the job, a young girl goes missing, and babbage is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone astray. him and allison narrow a list down and discover some of the offenders have gone awol. so, he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police. that part is a little far fetched.<br /><br />there is some sick, twisted stuff shown in this film. like when babbage and allison go to this building where a bunch of sick people do disturbing things to each other. also, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. at the end of the film, we see what sick freaks they are. however, i wouldn't call this movie excessive because not really much is shown on film.<br /><br />final verdict: if you like thrillers and films about serial killers and cops chasing killers, then you will like this.
