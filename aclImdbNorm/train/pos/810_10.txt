this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies. <br /><br />the starting point of the movie was almost like episode iv--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place, where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious. he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of bantha, who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. luke's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off. adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo, who was frozen alive at the end of episode v, jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outside.<br /><br />but all of the star wars "good guys", especially r2-d2, had other ideas...and those other ideas fended off luke's execution; in the end, most of jabba's soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to death.<br /><br />like in episode iv, the death star in episode vi makes its appearance. as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star, the star destroyer personnel, i guessed, sped up the arming of the main laser, using the imperial fighters as a diversion. the 20-25 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise. once it fired, the rebel fleet's only hope was that the death star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out, and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out. and it was taken out with lando's increasing impatience.<br /><br />like in episode v, the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons, killing at least one of the ewoks...but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them. for instance, chewbacca, as well as another ewok, was able to commandeer one of the walkers (and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers), and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers.<br /><br />it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre, like, for instance, the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike, and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike. or, in a climax, using the sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vader.<br /><br />you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown, complete with a short display of fireworks, drumming on the spoils of victory (e.g., storm trooper masks), and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke's own nemesis---darth vader, now dead, is burned on a pyre. the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy that--even with the strong respect of film composer john williams.<br /><br />on the home movie version, i think lucas himself wanted a different ending. in addition to the celebration on endor, he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith. the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star's destruction, balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies.
