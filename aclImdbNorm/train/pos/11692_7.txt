i'm not saying that just as a chris rock fan, i'm saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong. the first flaw was it's everything-works-out ending that everybody saw coming. flaw number two was i found that the chemistry between regina king and chris rock seemed fake. finally the acting in this movie was sub-par, with the best actor being regina king and the worst being mark addy. but i saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy. in a heads-up scenario, watch heaven can wait instead, it's better. so for all you chris rock fans out there, watch this movie, you'll enjoy out. he has some good stand-up in this movie.<br /><br />overall: 7 out of 10
