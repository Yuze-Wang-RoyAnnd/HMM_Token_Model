for a while i was caught in the trap where i found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that i liked them. fatty drives the bus is the exception. it is the truth. it is the best "bad" movie ever.<br /><br />the "badness" of this movie seems to come naturally. halfway through satan's opening monologue, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. the glamorous bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress. it takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other forever to walk down the stairs. jesus walks to a funk soundtrack.<br /><br />anyways, fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior's film project. but it's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful. you get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad, but never forced it.<br /><br />never to be duplicated in wonder, fatty delivers. highly highly recommended.
