i'll say this to begin with:...why, oh why, can't wb do what these short film directors do? sandy is obviously an amazing director, and deserves some credit from wb and dc. but i guess they're kinda put on edge when a man with a $12,000 budget can make a super-hero fan drool. the world's finest is one of the best short films i've ever seen, trailer or not.<br /><br />i think choosing a bodybuilder(mike o'hearn) to play superman was a genius choice. let's face it people, superman is no super-model. he may be handsome, but a gq stud he is not. and i don't know what that guy a few comments above me was on, but superman is actually pretty beefy(have you ever actually read a superman comic?). i guess that fact alone just floors me...it seems like such an obvious choice to get someone with some actual muscle-mass to play a super-hero, rather than a pretty-face. same thing for batman, bartram is in incredible shape, and an excellent batman...i don't know guys...if given a bigger budget, and his own movie...i think bale and bartram would be neck and neck. bottom line, this is one of only a scant few of super-hero movies with actors that actually look the part.<br /><br />the acting is pretty nice as well. i don't know what every one is talking about, o'hearn isn't that bad. he's damn convincing as superman, and bartram...well, he is batman. i mean, come on people, this movie had a $12,000 dollar budget, what were you expecting?. everyone else is great too, except two-face seems a tad crazier than usual...but hey, we only have tommy-lee jones as a reference. oh, lois is pretty hot too.<br /><br />the sfx are flippin' sweet too. i mean, seeing superman lift the car up...man!, how cool is that. versus the "tank" scene in grayson, i may have to put this one above that, since mike actually looks like he's flying, and with ease. the flying sequences left something to be desired, but once again, with a bigger budget...oh, and he even used a batmobile!(it was probably a model, but it looked damned convincing).<br /><br />all in all, this trailer's only downfall was a lack of a serious budget. and wb refuses to admit that collora is a credible director, and needs to be apart of some kind a project...but no, they'll(like most of the marvel projects) just keep getting these hack directors who show almost no regard for the fans and what they care about, and keep churning out these gamble movies. thank god superman returns was a hit, or that seriously would've been the end of it. world's finest is excellent, and in my book, counts as a superhero movie.
