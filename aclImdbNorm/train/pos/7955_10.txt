this is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever created. i cry every time i see shadow yelling "wait, wait for me peter!" as the family car is pulling away. this is a must see if you love animals! best movie ever! the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. like when sassy says to chance; "cat's rule and dogs drool!" lines like this i could do without, but when i was six i bet i loved that line. the storyline may seem hooky to some, but i like it. shadow as the older dog who's preparing chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it. it reminded me of my childhood dog. i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in "homeward bound."
