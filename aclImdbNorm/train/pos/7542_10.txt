this movie will not sit well with some, but it is a must view. i am glad someone finally brought up for discussion the realities of how african american couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there as "other" african americans moved in.<br /><br />(minor spoilers)<br /><br />this little showtime film is almost like a spike lee joint...you have an african american male (danny glover) who worked his way hard through the traditionally white law profession positions in the 1970's. like any american, he moved his family to be compatable with his upwardly mobile status but forgot, there was still alot of problems going on. the only african americans in the neighborhood at the time was the maids. one owning a home? wow.<br /><br />then the blending in began. his wife (whoopi goldberg) is told to "get involved" so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do. and just when the man thinks he and his family are "in", right next door comes another african american who got in because they won the "lotto" (mo'nique), and in his eyes and he wants nothing to do with them for he doesn't want the neighborhood to think they are alike. he, of course is of a better calibre, his new neighbor is "ghetto" not an shouldn't be there! who's got a problem now?<br /><br />what this film shows you is the great pains it takes for this family to fit in, and how they lose themselves in the process. it makes you question where does racism begin and end...and with whom. it shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have, you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you. it also shows how these african american children, when "blending in" neighborhoods such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture (complete with blonde hair and blue eyes, mind you!) around them. they laugh along with the jokes, not knowing they are the joke and not knowing..why.<br /><br />but overall, this film is about 'people'. no matter what race you are, this film gets into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and toward each other...all for the sake of fitting in..all because you feel you have more money than others, so that automatically makes you better -- and you forget the struggles you had and those coming up behind you.<br /><br />again, not for everyone. but take a look and judge for yourself.<br /><br />
