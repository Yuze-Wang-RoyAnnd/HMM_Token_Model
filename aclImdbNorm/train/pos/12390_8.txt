bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by cristina raines (later of tv's "flamingo road") as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the gateway to hell! the scenes with raines modeling are very well captured, the mood music is perfect, deborah raffin is charming as cristina's pal, but when raines moves into a creepy brooklyn heights brownstone (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor), things really start cooking. the neighbors, including a fantastically wicked burgess meredith and kinky couple sylvia miles & beverly d'angelo, are a diabolical lot, and eli wallach is great fun as a wily police detective. the movie is nearly a cross-pollination of "rosemary's baby" and "the exorcist"--but what a combination! based on the best-seller by jeffrey konvitz, "the sentinel" is entertainingly spooky, full of shocks brought off well by director michael winner, who mounts a thoughtfully downbeat ending with skill. ***1/2 from ****
