i think the film is educational. however, it fails to treat the issue which sparked so much controversy: plural marriage. also, the film fails to reveal what the lds church espouses. big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe. i could not get a clear idea of what it is lds views are on central topics of religion.<br /><br />i have many lds friends and they are nice people. would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they view their prophet's more controversial statements. maybe these statements are just too controversial to be treated in a film format, but it would have been great to hear the whole story of joseph smith's truly interesting life. after all, it gives insight into american thought on religion in the 18th century. hope they do some documentaries on this fascinating subject, allowing historians to comment on smith's life. we may have a mormon president some day. after all, smith ran for president.
