it was originally meant to be a film that gene kelly would star in, but when the makers couldn't get him they got "the greatest actor in the world", and the result is pretty good. basically nathan detroit (frank sinatra) is having trouble doing what he does best, setting up a high stakes crap dice game, because he needs $1000 to get the place. so to get the money he needs, he has a $1000 bet with old friend sky masterson (marlon brando) that he can't get sergeant sarah brown (great expectations' golden globe winning, and bafta nominated jean simmons) to go with him to havana. meanwhile, nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants him to ask her hand in marriage, miss adelaide (vivian blaine). also starring robert keith as lieutenant brannigan, stubby kaye as nicely nicely johnson and b.s. pulley as big jule. an interesting romantic comedy musical, with brando singing all his own songs, and sinatra being smooth and cool. it was nominated the oscars for best art direction-set decoration, best cinematography, best costume design and best music for jay blackton and cyril j. mockridge, it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source, and it won the golden globe for best motion picture - musical/comedy. frank sinatra was number 43 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons, marlon brando was number 30 on the 100 greatest movie stars, he was number 11 on the 100 greatest sex symbols, he was number 4 on 100 years, 100 stars - men, sinatra was number 35, and brando was number 1 on the world's greatest actor, "luck be a lady" was number 42 on 100 years, 100 songs for , the film was number 23 on 100 years of musicals, and it was number 36 on the 100 greatest musicals. very good!
