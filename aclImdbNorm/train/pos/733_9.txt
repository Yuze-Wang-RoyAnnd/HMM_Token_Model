how can you go wrong with the amazing ramones? what a crime that two of them are already dead. it reminds me of the dennis leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. i'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />rock and roll high school tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. it's extremely silly stuff, but there's an optimism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? rock and roll high school is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. it's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.<br /><br />but most important, this is pure exploitation.<br /><br />take none of it seriously. just go in and have a good time. if this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies, then it should have been.
