first off i'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit over-the-top. a toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow would've made this movie much less cheesy. but overall i think it's one of the better b-movies. tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. though this movie is missing the all-important nude factor, there are several other movies at which to view her. but here she gets all evil-hotness, especially towards the end as she's walking away from the engulfed scarecrow. also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend. yes it's a low budget b-movie. but out of all of them i've seen, this is definitely one of my very top favorites.
