<br /><br />in 1970, after a five year absence, kurosawa made what would be his first film in color. dodes' ka-den is a film that centers around many intertwining stories that go on in a small tokyo slum.<br /><br />the title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes as he imagines he is operating a train. we slowly get to know more of the people in the small community, the two drunks who trade wives because they are not happy with the ones they have. the old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him. the very poor father and son that cannot ever afford a house, so they imagine one up of their own. by the end of the film, the stories all come full circle, some turn out happy, others sad.<br /><br />since this was kurosawa's first color film you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows. maybe too much. this movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle down and get into it. but don't get me wrong, dodes' ka-den may not be kurosawa's best, but coming from the greatest director of all time, it's much better than 99% of today's films.
