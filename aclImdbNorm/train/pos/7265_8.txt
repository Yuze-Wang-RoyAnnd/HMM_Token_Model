good story. good script. good casting. good acting. good directing. good art direction. good photography. good sound. good editing. good everything. put it all together and you end up with good entertainment.<br /><br />the shame of it is that there aren't nearly enough films of this caliber being made these days. we may count ourselves lucky that writers/directors like john hughes are occasionally able to make their creative voices heard.<br /><br />whenever i notice that i'm watching a film for the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly satisfying i have to conclude that something about that film is right.
