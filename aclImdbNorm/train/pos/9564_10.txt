this has got to be the best movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot, and you have a masterpiece.<br /><br />dog bite dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes, recoiling in horror during others, and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic ending.<br /><br />the film left a deep impression on me. it's shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the poignant and tender 'love' scenes. the film is undeserving of it's cat iii (nudity) rating; there are no nude scenes whatsoever, and the 'love' scenes do not even involve kissing or 'making out'.<br /><br />the message which this film presented to me? all human beings, no matter how violent or cruel they may seem, have a tender side. edison chen does a superb job playing the part of the murderous pang.<br /><br />i rate this film 10/10. it's a must-watch.
