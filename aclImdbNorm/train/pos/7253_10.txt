not sure one can call this an anti-war film, it shows war at an elite level. these are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it. even when they are pacifist, they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes, even if it does go against being a pacifist. the movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go-more so by todays standards, no body parts flying off as in modern movies. it is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level. this is more of a thinking man's movie. once you start to watch you don't want to miss anything. the thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions, is what the movie is about- not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline. this maybe called a war triller.<br /><br />if you are into the skill of war, if you are into reading or seeing programs about the sas and so on, you want to watch this movie!!!!!<br /><br />comparable movies are the hill (1965) with sean connery, 49th parallel (1941) with an all star cast, the naked and the dead (1958) with cliff robertson. all are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level. enjoy!
