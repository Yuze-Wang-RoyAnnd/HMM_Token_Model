the final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. it goes further to play the anti-bond theme. bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting.<br /><br />the film starts out in a flurry as bourne is running from the moscow police. the story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. or does it? the time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that bourne is remembering things. a sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. they aren't his target. from there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, noah vosen, who seems to know everything about bourne and will protect it at all costs. pamela landy is back as well as nicky parsons who seems to have a past with bourne as well.<br /><br />the cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. the car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. and the veteran cast chasing bourne is superb with a nice part by albert finney. it also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. all in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.
