i liked the movie, first of all because it told an interesting story, but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much-longer story. since the book is over 400 pages, that makes sense. it spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictional south american country, also a lot to fit into the time available. i think it would have been much better as a six-hour mini-series than it turned out as a 140-minute movie.<br /><br />even though it's rushed, the story doesn't skip so much that it gets confusing. what is told is told fairly well. one fault is that clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistently; either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie, or they should have been left out. two more faults (which could be spoilers): esteban's eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly, and ferula's curse seems to wear off, even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever.<br /><br />the acting is excellent. glenn close, as the tormented spinster ferula, is outstanding. jeremy irons, as the brutal self-made rich man, is also excellent. meryl streep, as the main character clara, is great, although she's often even better than she was in this movie. there were many well-performed smaller roles too. the biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach; each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent.
