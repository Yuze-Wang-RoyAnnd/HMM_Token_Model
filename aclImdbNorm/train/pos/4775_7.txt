if it's action and adventure you want in a movie, then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere. on the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood, check out "the straight story."<br /><br />richard farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly alvin straight, in this true story of alvin's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke.<br /><br />farnsworth is perfect in this role, as he travels his long and winding road, making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way. the story moves along as slowly as the riding mower, but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching, waiting for the next life lesson alvin's going to offer.<br /><br />stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. it's the only way to watch this very good movie, which rates a 7/10 in my book.
