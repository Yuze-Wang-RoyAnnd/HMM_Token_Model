disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. films like "tarzan" and "the emperor's new groove" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. "atlantis" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: this is still disney. the first ever serious film to come out of disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into pg territory. perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.<br /><br />but despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of "the little mermaid" et al.<br /><br />so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. ultimately, this is an action film about atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood! if you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to james cameron's "titanic". both films feature a boat in some manner.<br /><br />and let's talk about love, shall we? yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one milo thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (kida, the clich'ed atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. but what i found was not as clich'ed as i was expecting. by film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. there's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, "the little mermaid" (a good thing).<br /><br />you may have grasped that this is a rather clich'ed film. correct. you have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. it doesn't take a genius to do the maths
