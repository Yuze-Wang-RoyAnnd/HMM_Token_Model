just after i saw the movie, the true magic feeling of the walt disney movies came up in me and i realized me that it was a long time ago that i saw the 'real' magic in a movie.<br /><br />the combination of the right music, speeches and magical effects brings the disney feeling again into your body. very special things i saw where the not-knowing effects in the movie, started with the disney logo transforming into the cinderella castle and ended as an old-story telling fairytale with your grandparents.<br /><br />the magic has returned in me. i rate this movie 8 out of 10.
