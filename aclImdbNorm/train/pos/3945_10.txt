the rating is only a 5 because it's a movie that could have used better acting and direction (or at least music!). however, for the achievements of walt whitman, it deserves a 10. a previous poster calls the movie cheesy, however, i think it's a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees. the film makers were apparently more interested in getting the story out there than to have a hollywood shiny feature film. and for this, i applaud them - the fact it is non-mainstream reflects the life of whitman as well. this film is more documentary than for the sake of acting. to be fascinated with a story such as this, when you rarely hear of these types of stories that shape current day mental health, is the most important thing. i found it a highly enjoyable look at history.
