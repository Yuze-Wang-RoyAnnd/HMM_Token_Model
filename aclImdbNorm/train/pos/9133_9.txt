i was to young to ever know much about prince but in the past few years i've seen a lot of purple rain novelty tee's and i thought they were cool but i didn't want to buy a shirt i knew nothing about. so one saturday it came on fuse and i decided to watch it. i didn't know what the movie was going to be about before i watched it but it was great once i found out. in the movie prince wasn't known as prince but as "the kid". all the performances where great to me but my favorite were purple rain, darling nicki, and i would die for you. all the songs tied into what was going on through out the movie when his mother and father were always fighting the song when doves cried described what he was feeling. i also like how clever prince was with the way he flirted with apallonia. i liked when prince and appallonia first met in the club and he stood behind her standing and then once she turned around he disappeared! great movie and now i cant even find one of those tee shirts :(
