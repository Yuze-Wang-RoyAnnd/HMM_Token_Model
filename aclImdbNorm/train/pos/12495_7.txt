what's good about it: some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan. doesn't rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its "gotcha" moments. even if you've seen everything, there's still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop.<br /><br />what could have been better about it: the acting was, at times, flat and unconvincing. it had a "shot-on-video" quality in some places (though,it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for), and the camera work is full of needless close-ups of meaningless actions. though the effects are genuinely creepy, i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them. the ending seemed rushed, and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments. the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves, not as a challenge by the filmmakers, but because they just missed it.<br /><br />still, a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average. well worth the rental.
