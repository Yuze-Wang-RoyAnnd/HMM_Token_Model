i read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more.this is the way a proper horror movie should be.i think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic. the spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood.i liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out.it was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated.the special effects were very good.i would love to see more horror movies like this one.this is easily one of my favorite's.a realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie.other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs.i highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches.i will be adding it to my collection.the dvd has some interesting special features.
