i picked this one up on a whim from the library, and was very pleasantly surprised. lots of tight, expressionistic camera work, an equally tight script, and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film. not for the reptilian multiplex brain, but rather the true aficionado of cinema. if hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it, i'm sure it will ruin it. a choice treat all the way around. other posters here have more than amply sung its praises, so i needn't bother duplicating their paeans; just take their advice, and mine, and don't miss this gem. call it what you like; i call it two hours of entertainment well-spent. read my lips: don't miss it.
