the material in this documentary is so powerful that it brought me to tears. yes, tears i tell you. this popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights, put forth the greater good of the community and stop making up cowardly excuses for not challenging the establishment. chavez represents the weak and misfortunate in the same way bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism ran amok. indeed, latin america is being reshaped and the marginalized majority is finally having a voice in over five centuries. though, in the case of mexico, the election was clearly stolen by calderon. chavez is not perfect, far from it. he's trying to change the constitution to allow him to rule indefinitely. that cannot be tolerated. enough with the politics and back to the movie; the pace is breath taking at moments, and deeply philosophical at others. it portrays chavez as a popular hero unafraid to challenge the us hegemony and domination of the world's resources. if you think the author is biased in favour of chavez, nothing's stopping you from doing your homework. one crucial message of the film is questioning info sources, as was clearly demonstrated by the snippers casualties being shamefully blamed on chavez's supporters. venezuela puts american alleged democracy to shame. hasta la revolucion siempre!
