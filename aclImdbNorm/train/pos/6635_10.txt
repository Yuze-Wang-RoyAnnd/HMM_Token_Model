what can i say about the first film ever?<br /><br />you can't rate this, because it's not supposed to be entertaining. but if you have to rate it, you should give it a 10. it is stunning to see moving images from the year 1895. this was one of the most important movies in history. i wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever!<br /><br />
