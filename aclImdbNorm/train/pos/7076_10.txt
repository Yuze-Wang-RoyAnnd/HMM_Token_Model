a very strong movie. bruce is good and brad also.<br /><br />as i think there are two cities missed in the receptionist list from the list bruce remembered.<br /><br />that means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job.<br /><br />well, novikov property seems to me work in this movie. however, i do believe in back to the future theory of worlds' multiplicity.<br /><br />so bruce could save the world, but not his world.<br /><br />in the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself.<br /><br />and i do believe there is no problem in that. here i disagree with dr. brown from back...<br /><br />but the story pf 12 monkeys has its own beauty. inspite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost.<br /><br />a sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future. the bullet - well it might be some mistake, some falsification.<br /><br />well i like this movie - has to buy a dvd.<br /><br />best.
