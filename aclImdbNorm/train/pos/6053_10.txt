a comedy gem. lots of laugh out loud moments, the shop and pub scenes had me belly- laughing uncontrollably. the characters are recognisable and the dialogue well-observed - i know people like this! the humour is surprisingly gentle and the film (this may sound strange) puts me in mind of an ealing comedy. it's a quirky little film with lots of detail. it certainly takes a number of viewings. i've watched it a few times (i've been showing all my friends!) and notice something new each time - a bit of dialogue,something visual that i hadn't picked up on before. i could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but i'm not going to because overall this is a great fun, feel-good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy. it is a film which will find it's friends and i hope there are a lot of them out there. oh.... and it has a great soundtrack.
