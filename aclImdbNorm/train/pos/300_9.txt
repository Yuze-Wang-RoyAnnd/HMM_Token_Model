with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew "they all laughed" is very much a family affair.if you add the fact that b.gazzara and miss a.hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.if this all smacks of smug "in - joke" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "i love n.y." paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn. make no mistake this is her picture.mr gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. the plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. mr bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from "targets" onwards.there is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.miss hepburn in particular benefits from this love. extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally "who the hell's in it?", recently remaindered in uk bookstores. the soundtrack to "they all laughed" varies from louis armstrong's 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays. mr b,s "golden boy" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be restored,and when that day comes "they all laughed" will be recognised for the fine work that it is.
