an overlong, but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader steve biko and donald woods. the first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men, and how they help each other out, but the second half isn't as strong, due to the elimination of the biko character. still, its a compelling film with great performances by kline and washington, in the film that put the latter on the map. washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time. overall, a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit. 7/10.____________________________________
