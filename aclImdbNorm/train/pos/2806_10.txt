okay, first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie. so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion.<br /><br />first off, bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century. if that's what you're looking for go somewhere else. just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy. it's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished.<br /><br />secondly, the acting though not "halle berry in monster's ball" is still good. the movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it. it's a family movie. if that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly.<br /><br />lastly, it has a really cute story. i think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch. it's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished. if you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you.<br /><br />-lyndsay
