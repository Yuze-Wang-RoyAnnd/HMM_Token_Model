lubitsch's last production but not his least interesting film. somehow largely ignored by critics as he couldn't finish it himself and as the movie wasn't co-signed by preminger who he did most of the staging... a very strange mix of musical (a remembrance of the merry widow ?)and classic lubitsch touch sentimentalism (an impossible love-story like cluny brown)yet a very clever and intelligent one yet not to be understood as some nostalgia of some lost world but rather a testament on eternal feelings prevailing on the foolishness of mankind and especially men in times of war with a "moral" lesson still true today as it was in 1948. billy wilder as an answer to preminger who grieved at lubitsch's funerals about having lost a great man replied that we still had his films and that sums it all up about that lady in ermine...
