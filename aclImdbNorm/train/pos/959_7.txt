there are many police dramas doing the rounds. i am not sure why. it's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil.<br /><br />this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne, a raw recruit, into a police squad stationed in the baltic area. no attempt is made to glamorise the police. they are truly down to earth, harsh at times and unforgiving, anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations.<br /><br />this is not a pleasant film. not one to relax you. there is not much feeling of optimism in it. the police seem to be involved in a losing battle. tomorrow there will be more bashings, more murders, more family break-ups, and more distressed children. let's face it. this is the world we live in.<br /><br />as days go by anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating. the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny, a 12 year old from a broken family. anne has her own way of patching things up. she turns a blind eye to benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can. i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce benny's father. it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs. after all, the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children.<br /><br />well cast but not my idea of an evening's entertainment,
