a great british indy movie! fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drug-fuelled set pieces that cheech and chong would be proud of. great to see phil daniels back on the big screen (even if he has swapped sides since quadrophenia!) and gary stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! loved the final fight scene with it's nod to zulu and now i know what happened to arthur brown after he set himself on fire on top of the pops!...he's not acting....he really is a bona-fide british hippie!!! you don't have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's straight into my friday night post-pub repeat viewing collection. <br /><br />give this film a go and you won't be disappointed.
