just to mention one more thing about gentleman jim. i agree with all the assessments that make this among errol flynn's greatest outings in a career of great outings. i would think this role playing boxer jim corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as. flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. the extra thing i wanted to point out is notice the great montages, transitions, and still inserts that punctuate the film. although the director was raoul walsh, a frequent collaborator with flynn, with cinematographer sid hickox, the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named don siegel. i never knew siegel went that far back but he's listed right in the credits. he would go on to a great career as action director himself.
