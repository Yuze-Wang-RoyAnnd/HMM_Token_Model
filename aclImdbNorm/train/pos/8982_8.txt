damn, was that a lot to take in. i was pretty much mesmerised throughout. it was pretty perfect, though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that. i can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them (anton especially) to get all of this footage without any serious... beef. the dandy's did come off well-together, middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). i felt bad for jonestown and especially for anton, which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt. great piece of film-making and great choice of subject(s). i recommend this to any music/film fan. you'll probably learn something about film-making.
