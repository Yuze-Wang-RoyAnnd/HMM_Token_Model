i've only ever seen this film once before, about ten years ago. i bought the dvd two days ago and after watching it i think it is even better than i remembered it to be.<br /><br />paperhouse is much more than just a horror. it had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it. i especially thought charlotte burke was really excellent here. it's such a pity that she hasn't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether. her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across, especially at the end when she realised that although marc had died, she knew he was going to be alright.<br /><br />several scenes did make me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the bathtub, the scene where anna's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust.<br /><br />all in all, an excellent and very moving film.
