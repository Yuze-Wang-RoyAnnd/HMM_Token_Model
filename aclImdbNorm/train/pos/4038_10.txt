this may be the only film that actually comes close to capturing on film the essentially uncapturable world of the american college experience of the late 60s-early 70s. go ahead, name another movie that even approaches this one: "getting straight"? "rpm"? these are caricatures. "return of the secaucus seven" has its moments, but that's a retrospective film about (self-obsessed) individuals more than a film about a time and a place depicted *in* that time and place. "drive, he said" portrays-- with subtlety and nuance where it should, and a swift kick in the shorts where that's the only appropriate way-- the anti-draft movement, the ambiguity of big-time college sports (especially when there's a war on), the sexual revolution of the period, and the general unreality of the day. believe me, it was like that.<br /><br />the whole cast deserves commendation (as does the director, of course) but particular praise should be reserved for bruce dern, as the basketball coach, and karen black, the hero's very unusual-- except for that time-- love interest. william tepper, as the lead, also rates a real round of applause both for his perfect capturing of the student-athlete of the period and for actually playing real college basketball in the film (remember anthony perkins in "tall story"? yikes!).<br /><br />all in all, a classic of a kind-- and the last film someone currently in 6th grade should be writing comments on ("boring", "repellent"-- um, right, sonny, please go back to your arnold movies). why isn't this film available from imdb?
