as someone who has seen and followed hartley's public work for several years i think much of what used to be fiction told through true stories has been elevated into obscure philosophical mind games.<br /><br />while entertaining, fay grim is another step in the henry fool line of thinking, where the movie reflects the quality of an object within the movie itself. in henry fool, the object is the memoirs... in fay grim, the object is encrypted memoirs - which are themselves stolen, forged and trans-mutated into something so obscure it can't really make any sense - i.e. the process of script writing and film-making in the modern era - where most blockbuster films are little more than a mash-up of the past. that is, in a philosophical sense, what fay grim is all about. the object, perhaps, is the tragedy that shock is now clich'e and dull (as hinted in the opening scenes at the publishers office).<br /><br />that being said, many of the movie best points are lost if you do not understand henry's character and the significance of the memoirs being looked for. henry is a thinly veiled devil, first visiting simon as a modern faust, etc. without understanding how tragic henry's character is, much of the quality of fay grim's plot and story is lost.<br /><br />and there is not enough 'detail' expressed through verbal flashbacks - knowing the plot of henry fool cannot compare to 'feeling' the quality of the characters as one did in henry fool, and so i think for someone who walks into this movie cold there is about 10 minutes of 'so what' responses to highly constructed dialog and then that's it.<br /><br />however, henry fool was also my least favorite hartley film until i realized that it was bad - putrid and infested - precisely because henry fool's confessions were bad... not just raunchy or dirty, but inescapably broken. henry can not even be a proper villain - and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him most endearing... like gollum in tolkien's works, henry is pitiable.<br /><br />that doesn't come across in fay grim, although henry's dialog is excellent. what does come across is that the entire movie is constructed as an encryption - a sort of molding of another plot around what ends up being yet another bad story to add to henry's confessions. it is an interesting twist, but one that can't really be digested without viewing the first film. perhaps showing more of henry earlier on would have been better than having the publisher describe the basic storyline of the first movie - although this plot is also not really what the first movie was about - unless perhaps one is a casual observer.<br /><br />part of the encryption? hard to say... a little disappointed at the sex gimmicks though. cheesy.
