this is a great film!!!<br /><br />i first saw this film when it came out. i just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it. a lot of films we watched when we were younger don't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life. the film is actually a great 80's example of the type of films made then. keaton is at his best, all the actors actually did a very good job and ron howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it. the pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80's is too funny. being from the 80's i loved seeing the ugly pacer again. the film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80's film lovers.
