we don't have to lose this movie, this is one of the greatest i have ever seen. jean pierre leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue. jean eustache is no more on this earth, we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors. you just have to love this masterpiece. i'll never forget it.<br /><br />p.s.: sorry for the english...
