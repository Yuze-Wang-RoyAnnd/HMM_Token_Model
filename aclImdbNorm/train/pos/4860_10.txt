a damsel in distress is a delight because of the great gershwin songs, fred astaire, joan fontaine, and a terrific supporting cast headed by gracie allen and george burns.<br /><br />typically silly plot for an astaire film has him as an american dance star in england with burns as his publicist and allen his secretary. they concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right. he runs into fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father. silly plot.<br /><br />the great songs include a foggy day, things are looking up, nice work if you can get it, and i can't be bothered now. fontaine does not sing, but does a brief (and decent) number with astaire. surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with astaire are burns and allen, including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park.<br /><br />also in the cast are reginald gardiner, constance collier, montagu love, harry watson (as albert), ray noble, and my favorite--jan duggan as the lead madrigal singer.<br /><br />jan duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings nice work if you can get it. her facial expressions are hilarious. she was also a scene stealer in the w.c. fields comedy, the old fashioned way, playing cleopatra pepperday.<br /><br />much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of ginger rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been hideously miscast. the tcm host notes that ruby keeler and jessie matthews were considered. yikes. two more would-be disasters. fontaine is fine as alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to astaire, with ample comic relief by burns and allen.<br /><br />fun film, great songs, good cast, and jan duggan in a rare spotlight!
