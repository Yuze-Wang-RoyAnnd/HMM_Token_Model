i didn't even want to watch this movie after reading maltin's review and 1 1/2 star rating. i watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than i expected. i would give it 2 1/2 stars out of a 4 star system. you have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all. if you don't know much about religion, you will miss a lot. i graduated from high school the year the movie was made, so maybe i can relate to it better. yes, there is some pretension in the movie and it's weird to some extent, but that was the 70s so what do you expect. i can see why people might not like the movie; however, i cannot understand people saying it is boring. the movie is anything but boring. you will either hate it or love it. if you find it boring, you are probably brain dead.
