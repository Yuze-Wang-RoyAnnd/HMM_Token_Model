this picks up about a year after the events in "basic instinct". catherine tramell (sharon stone) is now in london. while having sex with a soccer player while speeding about in a car going at 110 miles/hour (don't ask) she goes off the road and ends up in the thames. she survives--he doesn't. the police hire psychiatrist michael glass (david morrissey) to see if she's mentally competent to stand trial. naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murders and sex follow.<br /><br />this movie was doomed before it even opened. it took forever to get a cast and director, script problems were constant and the cast was not happy (morrissey complained about the movie often). still it's not too bad. it's a lot like the first--there's a lush music score, beautiful locations, plenty of sex and nudity (this had to be edited for an r), a nicely convoluted plot and good acting--but there's no impact. it feels like a retread of the first. people are being killed here with a choker leash (i believe)...just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first. in one cute moment stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it longingly. she's also playing mind games with a man and might be getting him implicated in murders. the similarities are too apparent.<br /><br />this is also very r rated--there's plenty of explicit sex talk, male nudity (morrissey looks a lot better nude than michael douglas), female nudity (stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. the acting is good across the board. stone is just fantastic here; morrissey looks miserable but is ok; charlotte rampling and david thewlis are good in supporting roles.<br /><br />so--this isn't at all bad but feels like a remake of the first. still i recommend it. people just attacked this because stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to "basic..." 14 years after it was made.
