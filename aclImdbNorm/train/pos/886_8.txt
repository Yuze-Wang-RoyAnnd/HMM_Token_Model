this was one of the dvd's i recently bought in a set of six called "frenchfilm" to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful provence this year. so far, as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinema.<br /><br />what a breath of fresh air to the stale, predictable, unimaginative, crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood. what a good example for screenplay writers, actors, directors and cinematographers to follow. it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures. <br /><br />the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end. is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly na"ive benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex-con would display? will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her? the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other.<br /><br />once you have seen this film, like me you may want to see it again. i still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look. the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office. you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place. but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied. four stars out of five for me.
