my goodness. this movie really really shows the talents of actors. billy connelly flexes his acting muscle. truly an amazing man, if you look at him in absolution as a rebel, boondock saints as a madman/killer, and then finally in fido as a zombie! his character in fido looks from cute to frightening, absolutely fabulous! cariie ann moss is no hack either! jumping in career from matrix and momento as a darker character, to a heart warming conservative 1950's housewife! rare these days to see actors being able to not be so type-casted.<br /><br />now onto the storyline (no spoilers, don't worry). this movie would make max brooks (author of zombie survival guide & world war z) happy with joy! finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy.<br /><br />if you like zombies, if you don't like zombies, if you are just bored, or if you are too busy, go see this movie!
