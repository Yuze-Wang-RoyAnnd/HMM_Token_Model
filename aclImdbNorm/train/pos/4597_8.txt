having first achieved fame with drunken master, jackie chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983's project a, a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re-established him as a major star. by the time police story was released two years later, the extraordinary hype surrounding jackie was reaching its zenith, and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts, brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy. it broke numerous box-office records and inspired a 50% rise in police recruits, but, viewed 20 years on - is it any good?<br /><br />as an action movie police story unquestionably stands up. there are several terrific fight scenes, some stuntwork that recalls the very best of chan's hero buster keaton, and a compelling if over-violent climactic tussle. jackie's performance is also very strong, and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film's impact just a little, his charisma carries it through. furthermore, in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger, jackie took a momentous gamble ... though in the event nobody seems to have noticed! by praising police story as a simple 'good vs. evil' battle critics belittled the film's ambiguity of tone, and whilst it's hardly the brothers karamazov, in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas.<br /><br />in short, this remains a quality "popcorn" movie* (though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film's final scene) - a potent, boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period.
