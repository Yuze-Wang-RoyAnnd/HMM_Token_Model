i first came across 'my tutor friend' accidentally one or two years ago while tv surfing. prior to that, i'd never watched any korean films before in my whole life, so mtf was really the first korean film i've ever watched. and- what a delightful surprise! i was thoroughly amused from the beginning to end, and had a great time laughing. its comic style is quite different from those of the hong kong comic films (which i've been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well), breathing fresh air into my humdrum film viewing experience. i thought there're quite a few scenes and tricks in mtf that are pretty hilarious, witty, and original too.<br /><br />i watched mtf the second time a few days ago, and having watched it once already, the surprise/comic effect on me kind of mitigated. that has, however, by no means affected negatively my opinion of the film. instead, something else came through this time- it moved me- the story about how two young, seemingly 'enemies' who're utterly incompatible get thrown together, and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves, reminds me of the long gone high school days. to me, su wan and ji hoon are actually compatible as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them, a quality that separates them from people like say, ji hoon's sassy girlfriend.<br /><br />the film is divided into two distinct parts- the 1st part deals with the 'fight' between su wan and ji hoon, and is more violent and faster in pace. after ji hoon gets a pass in his final examination and su wan dances the (in ji hoon's opinion) provocative dance, things start to change. the pace slows down and... ji hoon suddenly realizes he cares for su wan more than he could ever imagine. so the 2nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings, leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang boss.<br /><br />just one last comment. i find this to be a bit unbelievable- the fact that a 21-year-old self-proclaimed 'bad boy' would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his 'cool' is just a little... odd. i guess that shows that ji hoon is just a boy pure at heart and isn't really what his appearance seems. btw, kwong san woo (ji hoon) does have a sexy body and perfect figure! ;-) <br /><br />mtf is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite films of all time.
