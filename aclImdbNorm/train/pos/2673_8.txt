the journey of hope (1990) is about a trek that many nomadic and poor turks make so they could live the good life in switzerland. these people are so desperate to live like westerners that they'll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. so many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation. one family braves the cold, the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals only to discover that there's not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel. this problem exists world wide, not just in america. some people tend to forget that. a heart breaker of a film that'll leave you wondering why at the end.<br /><br />highly recommended.
