this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn. while flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a couple of high-falutin' european terms!), this film gives him an opportunity to stretch (albeit only slightly) as an actor, as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. the supporting cast is excellent; everyone seems well-chosen for their roles.<br /><br />the story moves briskly and, while not particularly profound (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), it certainly entertains and satisfies. from what i know of jim corbett, the story is also reasonably faithful to history. i also really liked the great depictions of 1880s san francisco. all in all, there's little not to like about this film...very well worth the time to watch it.
