kay pollack (the man behind this movie) is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways. he has written a bunch of good and well written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. the message in most of his books and this movie, is about that your thoughts in fact is what causes your problems and that the reason of your anger hardly ever is caused of what you think of. the main message is that you can choose to be happy, but hardly ever do that.<br /><br />to watch this movie and learn something very important on life, you have to keep your mind very open and l i s t e n to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines to get through life) which most of the parts in this movie contains if you listen and watch. watch it with your ears.<br /><br />you won't learn the meaning of life, but you'll learn how to live and get the most out of it...<br /><br />so, while watching, please keep in mind:<br /><br />"the mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work unless it's open!"
