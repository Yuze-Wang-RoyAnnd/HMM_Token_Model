i have to say that this was not very exciting but talk about fashion and weird ways to solve a mystery. a little too simple, nancy drew (emma roberts) uses imdb... that's fantastic! i really liked about that part of the movie...<br /><br />corky (josh flitter) is however extremely hilarious... and ned nickerson (max thieriot) seemed really hopeless... he should have been more angry with her for how she has treated him...<br /><br />alright, this movie is tour and fashion in disguise. anyhow, i recommend this movie, just for summer fun. encore nancy, just for fun. more teen spy movies by emma roberts.. spymate... remember? she's becoming good at this tricky detective work.
