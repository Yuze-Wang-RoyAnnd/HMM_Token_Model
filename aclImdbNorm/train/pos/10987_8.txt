trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn't yet seen. renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse. my son is so jaded with current "b" science fiction that he hasn't bothered seeing this yet.<br /><br />it must be noted i didn't see anything about cypher when it was released in australia. it must have been very quiet or i just missed it.<br /><br />well this was a really pleasant surprise! this is also no b movie. it's not a "blockbuster" of the epic variety and doesn't try to be - more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it's plot to be fully savoured.<br /><br />the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view, but they get it right at it's 2nd appearance, & that aside everything else is top notch. in any case the affects are secondary.<br /><br />i won't give anything away about the plot. the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct (though with very different content).<br /><br />just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke. the actor was born in cambridge england, and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect, it's a tad off key. see the final twist of the plot and you'll see why that is such a brilliant choice! and lucy liu is also just right with her "will she kiss me - will she shoot me" edge.<br /><br />i rarely watch movies several times within days - this is one of them.
