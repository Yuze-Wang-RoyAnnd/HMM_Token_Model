tom the cat, jerry the mouse, and spike the dog (here called butch, his third name, his second being 'killer') decide to sign a peace treaty to all love each other. it's weird and a bit unnatural seeing them all buddy buddy like this and their friend's seem to think so too. but by the end thanks to a disagreement over a steak, everything is back to normal and all is how it should be. this short is the second one of three on the new spotlight dvd to be edited and i have no clue why this one was. this cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of "tom & jerry" <br /><br />my grade: b
