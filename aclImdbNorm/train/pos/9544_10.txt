meatball machine is an amazing splatter film, it has an original plot with young love, buckets of blood, and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines.<br /><br />now the film isn't for everyone, people who love splatter films or the movie tetsuo: the iron man will applaud it.<br /><br />the special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film, but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously.<br /><br />yet, all in all it's a lot of fun, well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles.
