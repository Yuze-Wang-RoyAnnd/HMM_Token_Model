one of john ford's best films 'the informer' doesn't feature any grand scenery of the american west. instead the intense drama ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of british character actor victor mclaglen's face. the former prizefighter, who once faced joe louis in the ring, delivers an academy award-winning portrayal of disgraced ira soldier gypo nolan on the worst night of his life.<br /><br />the plot is gracefully simple: in 1922 dublin, a starving and humiliated man who's been thrown out of the ira for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood, himself becomes an informant. for lb20 he betrays a friend to "the tans" and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt, denial, self-pity, and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions. <br /><br />it is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple gypo that is the film's most impressive achievement. in most movies a burly lout of gypo's type would be cast as the heavy, he'd have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown. in 'the informer' gypo himself is both hero and villain, while the showdown is in his inner turmoil, every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience.<br /><br />because liam o'flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929, rko gave ford a very modest budget. the director and his associates, particularly cinematographer joseph h. august, turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. in addition to mclaglen's oscar 'the informer' also won john ford his first along with wins for best screenplay and best score.
