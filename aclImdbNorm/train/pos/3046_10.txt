all good movies "inspire" some direct to video copycat flick. i was afraid that "gladiator" wasn't really that good a film, because i hadn't seen any movie that had anything remotely resembling anything roman on the new releases shelf for months. then i spotted full moon's latest offering, demonicus. i'm a fan of full moon's puppetmaster series, and blood dolls, but had never seen one of their non-killer puppet films. anyway...<br /><br />demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the alps. one of the campers, james, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts, and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on. he becomes possessed, and, as the demonic gladiator tyrannus, is impelled to kill his friends to revive the corpse, who is the real tyrannus.<br /><br />granted, like many full moon films, this has little or no budget. at times, the editing and direction was so amateurish i'd swear i was watching the blair witch project. the attempts at chopping off of limbs and heads reminds me of a monty python skit. the weapons, although apparently real, look really plastic-y. it literally looks like this was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder on a weekend. granted, there's nothing wrong with such film-making, just don't rent this expecting a technical masterpiece. it looks like there were attempts at research for the script too, because, even though tyrannus really doesn't act much like a gladiator until the end, at least he speaks latin.<br /><br />all trashing aside, i actually enjoyed this film. not as much as a killer puppet film, perhaps, but full moon still delivers! the only thing that disappointed me was there was no full moon videozone at the end!
