good old black and white graham greene based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things. hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the glop that's being minted by hollywood today. bacall lights up the screen of course and boyer is entirely engaging. they don't make movies like this any more.
