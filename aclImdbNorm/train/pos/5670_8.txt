esther williams gets her first post mgm starring role and gets off<br /><br />to a good start. this film is a well acted entertaining suspense<br /><br />with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more<br /><br />in the future - innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater. esther<br /><br />looks great and if she wanted to, probably could have gone on to<br /><br />do more and better films but according to her autobiography, <br /><br />pretty much gave up working for marriage. either way she is so<br /><br />likable and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different role<br /><br />outside of the 'swimming musical'. universal was fabulous for<br /><br />making films with former mgm stars after that studio began<br /><br />dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill. stars<br /><br />like lana turner, june allyson and others got to make quality first<br /><br />rate films at universal as they obviously still had drawing power at<br /><br />the box office. i wish esther had made more but since she didnt, it<br /><br />makes this one all the more special.
