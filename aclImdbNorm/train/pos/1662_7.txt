the film of artemisia may be considered treason, or as true artistic license. <br /><br />which might one aver?<br /><br />in documented history, artemisia gentileschi was subjected to the thumbscrew, and still affirmed that she was r***ed, as mary garrard and gloria steinem have eloquently affirmed.<br /><br />in the movie, under a different torture, she refused to condemn her lover/violator.<br /><br />how may a movie deviate so much from received history, yet still inform the human heart?<br /><br />the answer is not so hard to find. in the movie, the director and cast had filled a gaping hole in the historical record, with the power of imagination.<br /><br />that led to a conclusion that differs from the record.<br /><br />so be it. i find _both_ the record and the movie to be compelling.<br /><br />in both the movie and (it seems) in history, artemisia was a painter, before all else.<br /><br />for that vision, framed in ravishing (sic) film composition, i am truly grateful.<br /><br />seldom have i seen a movie that so compelled my eyes.<br /><br />david broadhurst
