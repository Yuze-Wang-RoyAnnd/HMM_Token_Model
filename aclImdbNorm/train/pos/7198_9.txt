this is a really good film and one that i've enjoyed watching several times. michael caine's awesome as always. michael caine has received kind of a reputation for taking any role in any movie no matter what the quality or lack of same but he does a good turn in playing sidney. from the start it's so well written. who would have thought that ira levin who wrote such creepy stuff as the boys from brazil and rosemary's baby could write something this witty. let's face it - michael caine, chris reeve, dyan cannon, henry jones... how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good directed by sidney lumet.<br /><br />i'm really reticent to go on because if anyone were to give away anything about this film it would be a crime. just watch it and adore it.
