when i was very young,on a local tv station,they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on saturdays.i saw lots of kung fu movies on weekends.i remember lots of them.i saw great flicks like crippled masters,blind fist of bruce,kung fu zombie,shaolin drunken monk,rage of the master,tattoe dragon,and...five deadly venoms.i remember the day clearly.me and my dad had just gotten lunch at burger king.we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday.we ran in the house and jumped onto the couch,turned on the set and flicked it onto 56.the usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words kung fu saturday over it.then under that was the title of the film.it said five deadly venoms.then the movie began.i bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence.i loved this movie the minute it came on.my favorite character was the toad venom.the plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn't what lured me...it was the fighting.the fights were so...amazing.i moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended.
