i finally got myself set up on mail order dvd rental so i could find movies not available to me in the stores. i chose the souler opposite because i love christopher meloni, and also like small, often ignored films.<br /><br />this one is such a treat! meloni has such charm in this part. it's easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego elliot stabler (losvu). in this film, meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer who is hitting the skids in many ways, only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected.<br /><br />the relationship drawn between barry (meloni) and tim busfield's character is realistic and not over done. i haven't seen busfield since 30something, and he was fun to watch. but it was all chris' film. i became such a fan girl all over again.<br /><br />it is a bit slow in the beginning, i will admit. i thought some of the "flashbacks" could have been edited down. but overall, this film will delight you - male or female - as it has an honest, refreshing view of relationships today.
