ultra-grim crime drama from pou-soi cheang, the director of "home sweet home". tonally, it reminded me of billy tang's "run and kill", although it's not as polished as that. nevertheless, it's an engaging, flawed bit of mayhem about a cambodian loner, pang (edison chen), who arrives in hong kong to kill a lawyer. while fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop sam wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence. there must be something in the air lately because i've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as i have lately. this is grim, nasty stuff, which is why i'm so partial to it, and i applaud its downbeat vibe. it's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique. dramatically, everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain. a subplot involving pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery.
