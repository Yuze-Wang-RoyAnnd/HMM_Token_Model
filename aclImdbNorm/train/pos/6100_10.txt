this is a really funny (and sexy) movie - that is not just silly but has great acting. it's the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater. i saw it at the boston film festival, and i found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else, and also moved by some of the movie's more serious parts. it's a unique movie about two doctors, and i don't want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones - plus the dialogue is great. wood harris' character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend zoe saldana, and brian white and mya are also funny and sexy in their roles. if you get a chance to see it - go - you won't be disappointed. it's worth seeing again. wood harris deserves an award.
