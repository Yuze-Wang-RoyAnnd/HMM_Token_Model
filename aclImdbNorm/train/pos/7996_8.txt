mean-spirited, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect. this film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. director scott doesn't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure. scott is either not aware or doesn't care for 30 years of social advances. i really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon, so you better go and see this one while you can. despite its relentless grimness, i think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister, exploitative, and effective. scott has a tough thing to sell, but i think i'm a buyer. the extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore. scott's directorial choices are simply astonishing, and he pulls a great performance out of denzel washington. sensitive souls need to stay away from this one, but i recommended it to those viewers looking for a great, action-filled movie.
