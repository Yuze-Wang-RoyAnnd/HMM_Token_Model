miriam hopkins is "the lady with red hair" in this 1940 biopic of mrs. leslie carter which also stars claude rains as david belasco, richard ainley as lou payne, and a fine cast of supporting players, including laura hope crews and victor jory.<br /><br />miriam hopkins and claude rains give wonderful performances. hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for mrs. carter. rains is great as the flamboyant, egotistical producer/writer/actor/impresario david belasco, one of the great names in theater.<br /><br />though mrs. carter's second husband, lou payne, served as adviser on this film, it's a poor representation of the real events of mrs. carter's life. true, there was a much publicized and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly viewed as a scandalous character for that and for becoming an actress. however, she had custody of her son dudley, so there was no custody battle. once she broke with belasco, she did not go back to him and, in fact, started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her life. she did indeed marry lou, and he became her leading man in many productions.<br /><br />the driving force for mrs. carter in the beginning of this film is regaining custody of her son, but she finally realizes that in her time away from him, he is thoroughly bonded with his father. in the film also (and i'm not sure if it was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house, which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere.<br /><br />not a bad movie, probably not a depiction of the greatness of either carter or belasco. one of mrs. carter's most famous moments was in the heart of maryland, where she wore a wig with six-foot tresses. off-stage, fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing. quite a visual.
