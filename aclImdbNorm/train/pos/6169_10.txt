rohinton mistry's multi-layered novel seemed impossible to adapt for the screen but the resulting movie is filled with passion, emotion, humour and pathos. the story is somewhat slow-moving but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience. the movie perfectly catches a particular time and place with pinpoint accuracy. all of the actors are indian - few if any known to "western" audiences - but they are a joy to behold, especially the little girl who acts very convincingly. don't be put off by the title and plot summary - this is a movie to be seen on the big screen. we have much to learn from it.
