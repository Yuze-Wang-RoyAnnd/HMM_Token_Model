glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made.<br /><br />the film makes you care about each member of this fox family, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic. set against an inhospitable countryside, the audience's hearts warm to the family members.<br /><br />the music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms.<br /><br />man remains one of the biggest predators, but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living, not just surviving beyond human endeavours.
