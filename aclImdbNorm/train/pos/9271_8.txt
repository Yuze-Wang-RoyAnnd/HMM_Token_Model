that's what one of the girls said at the end.<br /><br />is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls (or more broadly, a free-thinking group) and the authority? "to germany" means to a future that's of hope? <br /><br />it's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience i've ever had -- despite the crude cinematography and plot, and mild over-acting (though i like the cast -- they're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs). the ridiculous situation is well captured. i can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game (being female and a soccer fan) and i cannot stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise. i wonder why there's no women's section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided -- defeating the flawed reasons for the deny.<br /><br />the movie is very cleverly made -- the amazing title, the filming during the actual game, the spontaneity, and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters -- the game that's so important but inaccessible (not shown), the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium, the confinement of the van, and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside. i can feel the comfort coming from the radio, the drinks and the food, and of course, the kindness and consideration from each character to others. during the end credits, i am amused that no character has a name -- he's just any "soldier" and she's just any "girl" or "sister".
