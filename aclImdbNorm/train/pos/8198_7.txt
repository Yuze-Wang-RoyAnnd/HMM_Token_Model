dirty harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting her assailants in the goolies before killing them. probably a more apt punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like she and her sister has...anyway..... an action-packed story set again in san francisco and santa cruz. the chief rapist, played by andy drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end (of course!). not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original dirty harry.
