when i first watched this, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times. we've just watched it again and i liked it more than i did the last time i'd watched it!! :) :()<br /><br />the film is mainly about two dogs called charlie and itchy (voiced by dom deluise and i love dom deluise!) . charlie is half a gangster and half a goodie, which i like. itchy is his sidekick. charlie is killed by his friend (not) and sent to heaven. when charlie comes back to life, it is the start of an amazing adventure.<br /><br />the five main reasons why i'm absolutely crazy about this film: one: i love the characters (except carface). my favourite three are charlie, itchy and a little girl called anne-marie who comes slightly later. two: i love the period of history in which this film is set. it is set during the prohibition in the united states. three: the don bluth animation (as usual) is superb. the backgrounds are good too. four: there is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat. five: the songs in this are lovely. my favourite song starts with "i need brazil, the throb, the thrill"...<br /><br />so, watch this lovely film when you can, you won't be disappointed! :) ;) :()
