i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o'sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen.<br /><br />after the original film, we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. jane's skimpy jungle wear and tarzan's protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love.<br /><br />one's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan & jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. and jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.<br /><br />the skin show in this film is off the charts. in addition to jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan. (although it is not o'sullivan, but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene) weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.<br /><br />it's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry. although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.
