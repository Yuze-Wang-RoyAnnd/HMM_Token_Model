great fun. i went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film. we came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie. in the first part you just keep asking yourself about this 'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they get funnier and funnier. in search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next. until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we sure had a good time. the house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and i think about half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the film. if you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it. apart from clooney this movie deserves a lot better than the 5.6 imdb rating it has at the time i write this, but when more ppl have seen it i am sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable i guess, i would give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers)<br /><br />
