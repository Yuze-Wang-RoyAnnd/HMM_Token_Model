this effort is based on the true story of jim morris, a high school science teacher/baseball coach, who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his life-long dream of playing in the majors. dennis quaid, no stranger to sports films, plays morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the real-world events that led to morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull tampa bay devil rays. the first half of the film, dealing with his rag tag bunch of high school baseball players (all of whom look way too old to actualy be in high school) is less effective and probably a bit too long. overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without. however, it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason. grade: b-
