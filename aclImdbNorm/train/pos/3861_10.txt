2 words: academy award. nuff said. this film had everything in it. comedy to make me laugh, drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival breakin 2: electric boogaloo. the acting was tip top of any independant film. jeremy earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on the joan cusack show. his lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young jimmy walker. i thought i saw the next emergance of a young denzel washington when the line "my bus!! it's.... gone" that was the true turning point of the movie. my grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the dvd and recommended it to her friends. it will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white tony donato and african american nathan davis bond. through thick( being held up at knife point) and thin( nathan giving tony tips on women) the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to conquer hollywood.
