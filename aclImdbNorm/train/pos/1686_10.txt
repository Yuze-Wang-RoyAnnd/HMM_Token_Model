after a long hard week behind the desk making all those dam serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax. like wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci-fi paraday. 'captain zippo died in the great charge of the buick. he was a brave man.' the jack nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket. and always remember to beware of the 'doughnut of death!' keep in mind the number one rule of this movie - suspension of disbelief - sit back and relax - and 'prepare to die earth scum!' you just have to see it for yourself.
