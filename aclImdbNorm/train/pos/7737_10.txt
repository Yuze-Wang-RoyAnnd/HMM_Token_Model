if you're as huge of a fan of an author as i am of jim thompson, it can be pretty dodgy when their works are converted to film. this is not the case with scott foley's rendition of after dark my sweet. a suspenseful, sexually charged noir classic that closely follows and does great justice to the original text. jason patrick and rachel ward give possibly the best performances of their careers. and the always phenomenal bruce dern might have even toped him self with this one. like thompson's book this movie creates a dark and surreal world where passion overcomes logic and the double cross is never far at hand. a must see for all fans of great noir film. ****!!!
