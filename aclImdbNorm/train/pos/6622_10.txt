i just went to a screening of the film during expresion en corto, a short film festival in guanajuato, mexico. one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed: one long continuous shot of a futuristic paris in glorious black and white.<br /><br />i shouldn't go on with the details 'cause i think it is a film worth seeing. the sci-fi story might be found average for many... to me was really good. the action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere and i mean everywhere. things you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully. the cast performance is good, in my opinion no one hits the wrong note.<br /><br />now, the thing that i found awesome is the animation. 3d grafics look 2d. a bw comic book brought to life. the details on the backgrounds gives more texture as if it had been done by hand (i'm sure it was but when the angles change you see the depth). <br /><br />the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! the director, she said, is brilliant, but perhaps he was quite unexperienced since he only had one short film in his cv. so, many people had true faith in them. they started their own studio from scratch and ever since they faced the challenge they brought upon them.<br /><br />don't miss it. i think you won't regret it... maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film is superior to his i think.
