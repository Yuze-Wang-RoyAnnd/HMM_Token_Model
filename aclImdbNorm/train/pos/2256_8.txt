did not know what to expect from from van damme's partner & friend /trainer/and his fight choreographer for most of his films. it was nice to see him act as "tong po" in "kickboxer and other van damme's films. now he's on his own. he and his wife make a great team. in this one qissi is the action director and lead bad guy and he's good. really meanacing. his wife was the writer, producer and directed most of the scenes which didn't require action. she also did good job editing the film. together they did a great job. the story made sense, the fight scenes were edited well, the leads were real fighters and looked good together - the story came together well, and if you can beleive it...no bad language, no sex, just action. a new one on me. check it out!!!
