all of the reviews here about how much zp lacks plot, the acting is wooden, the orgy scene makes no sense, etc., all miss the main point.<br /><br />let's be honest. this is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s los angeles. it is a movie meant to be watched while your are h-i-g-h out of your mind on some psychedelic substance.<br /><br />find some kind bud and smoke up, or get a mild hit of acid. seriously, these straight and sober reviews of zp miss the point. you can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind.<br /><br />until you've watched this movie on the big screen (which i am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when zp was quite rare) tripping out, you have no idea what this movie is all about.<br /><br />if you insist on watching it not intoxicated, you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of pink floyd's wonderful re-working of "careful with that axe, eugene," "come in number 51, your time is up."
