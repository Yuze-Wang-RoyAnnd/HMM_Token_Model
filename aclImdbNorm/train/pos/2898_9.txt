what would happened when a depressed cop works with a shrink on probation? may be a lot of fun... this movie set a benchmark in the action/comedy genre of the argentinean cinema. dearable characters, probable story and a pace that between laughs has some thrill. i recommended it for a pleasant time of entertaining. peretti and luque join their efforts to fight against a cold and daringly foe in a time when it's difficult to trust someone. this movie will surprise you, the other side of the coin of "analyze me", but not alike, with nothing to envy. and if you like to know bs.as there where few scenes of downtown and the city center.
