the premise of this anime series is about bread, of all things to base a plot on! i truly laughed. the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with, and he goes off to bread baking school. i wish it were available on dvd, and it doesn't matter if it's subtitled or dubbed - it's that good. even the theme song alone is funny. at one point in the theme song, there's an african-japanese man with an afro on horseback, wielding a french baguette as if it were a samurai sword. these images will not make sense unless you see the anime. you'll laugh until your sides hurt. it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far.
