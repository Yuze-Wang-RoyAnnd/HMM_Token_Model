otto preminger's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of laura...while that film was glitzy and features the high fa-luting clifton webb, this film is a whole lot seamier. dana andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves. preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked. andrews is quite fine (a lot less wooden than he's been in the past) and the stunningly beautiful gene tierney is stunningly beautiful! creepy craig stevens plays the unlucky victim. where the sidewalk ends is a must see and a terrific companion-piece to preminger's equally lurid whirlpool (also starring tierney).
