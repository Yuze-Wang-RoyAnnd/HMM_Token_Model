i had read an article about dan jansen's olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie. i'm always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering events, and this was no exception.<br /><br />the background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the family's closeness and how they positively affected each others' lives. i can't speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie, it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script. however, the spirit of dan and his family is what matters here.<br /><br />its a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told. i felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end.
