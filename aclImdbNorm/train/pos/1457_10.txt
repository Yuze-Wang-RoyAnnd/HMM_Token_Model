i've watched this documentary twice - and although i'm an major movie buff, most documentaries don't hold my attention. this film however was mesmerizing. almost every shot is perfect - saying so much more than an audio commentary (which this documentary does not have).<br /><br />the concept of this film is amazing, i can't praise it enough. mardi gras beads - who would have thought?? <br /><br />amazing and excellent choices of interviews - film footage of a factory in china - the film makes you feel like you are actually there.<br /><br />i'm political aware - and i've read several books on globalization so there wasn't anything in this film that was a surprise to me. however, it's made me think so much. <br /><br />i wish so much too, that this world was a better place.<br /><br />a million kudos to the filmmaker - and thanks for making this film too.<br /><br />i wish everyone could see it.
