i can agree with other comments that there wasn't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn't a documentary! it was meant to entertain and i think it did a very good job at it.<br /><br />i agree with the black family. the scenes with them seemed out of place. like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but i did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good.<br /><br />despite it wasn't a re-enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade. i found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch.
