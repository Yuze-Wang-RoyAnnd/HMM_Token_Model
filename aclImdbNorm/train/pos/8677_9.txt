this film seems to be well remembered as the time tom & jerry signed a peace treaty. things are idyllic for a time but, predictably, it goes sour. probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe, a frying pan, and a baseball bat that the two plus butch the dog engage in at the beginning and end of the short. i enjoyed one a bunch and you should try to catch it on cartoon network.
