this little film had long been on my "keeper" list. do people realize how stressed out, menopausal, emotionally abused women (as well as the mentally retarded) were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century??!! all of the pious uptight christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring true emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. can you really imagine (by today's standards) that walt whitman's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans? think about that! the sensitivity of this movie still gets me and i give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes.
