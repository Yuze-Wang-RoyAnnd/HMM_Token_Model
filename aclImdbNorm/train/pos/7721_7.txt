a flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a 'forbidden planet.' what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in.<br /><br />on the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. some compare it to shakespeare's tempest, but this is a stretch, and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. stripped of what makes it a scifi film, sure, its the tempest, but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? <br /><br />underneath, this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek.<br /><br />anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. the special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. if it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece.<br /><br />this is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi i like to call 1950s sci-fi, and, though not, in my opinion, the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effects. the clever plot, now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek, lost in space, and even farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star trek's original series aired about 12 years later, though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. while i do not mean to nitpick, the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it. <br /><br />some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles. unfortunately, nielsen's performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). walter pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. ms francis, earl holliman, and the amazing robby the robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. the problems with the featured performances, i think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. though they certainly got most of the film quite right.
