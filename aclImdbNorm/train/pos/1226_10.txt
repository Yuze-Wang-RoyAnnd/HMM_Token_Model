they filmed this movie out on long island, where i grew up. my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer, (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. it never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as i knew, was never released on video, and i'm sure wasn't released on dvd. yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. so there must be something. i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother, yet there is no way i can find it anywhere. does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased? and which format that would be?
