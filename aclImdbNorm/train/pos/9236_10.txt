let's think people , quit bad-mouthing the original , for it's time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece , even still with all the stars , story lines and art . lorne greene was great as adama and richard hatch was perfect as apollo and dirk benedict was funny as starbuck , but i dare say , not as pretty as katee as starbuck . <br /><br />i loved the episode with the pegasus and greetings from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar , war of the gods , the best was experiment in terra , i thought that was a tribute in a way to heaven can wait , then you had the women of battlestar , not to compare them to let's say tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as number six , but jane seymour's beauty could not be compared to . let alone loerrta spang as cassiopea was fantastic .she had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by . i loved the original as much as the new .<br /><br />can you imagine if john calicos had a number six ? :)<br /><br />thankyou for listening .
