full house came to me when i was about 9. i remember seeing re-runs of america's funniest home videos with bob saget, and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called full house. one day, i was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family. it didn't seem too interesting at first, but as i watched more and more, ever night at 9:00, i would just be so into it.<br /><br />this show really makes you want to be there yourself, hang out with the girls, go places with them, and maybe even join in their little family "sing-alongs".<br /><br />the thing i like most about full house is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages. there will be some parts that are more for adults, then parts that are meant for kids, so that the whole family will enjoy it. no matter how cheesy it can be, it's still a great show, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />10/10
