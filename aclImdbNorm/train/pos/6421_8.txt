"men of honor" - true story about a proud and persistent black navy diver (fabulous cuba gooding jr.) is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and it's part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable, splendid experience. charismatic robert de niro is marvelous as rough, fierce and pitiless chief billy sunday - role is practically written for him. this film alongside with fantastic "15 minutes" (2001) are two of the latest proofs that he's still one of the very finest actors of our time. on the other hand "men of honor" includes a fine performance from cuba gooding jr. who has been one of the most promising young black actors since "boyz n the hood". "men of honor" goes straight into the company of "jerry maguire", "as good as it gets" and "instinct". cuba gooding jr. is a skillful and fantastic actor and i'm prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him. "men of honor" has also quite an excellent story-line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history. this is a great, fascinating movie and i can only recommend it.
