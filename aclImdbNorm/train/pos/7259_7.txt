how can the viewer rating for this movie be just 5.4?! just the lovely young alisan porter should automatically start you at 6 when you decide your rating. james belushi is good in this too, his first good serious role, i hadn't liked him in anything but about last night until this. he was pretty good in gang related with tupac also. kelly lynch, you gotta love her. well, i do. i'm only wondering what happened to miss porter?<br /><br />i gave curly sue a 7
