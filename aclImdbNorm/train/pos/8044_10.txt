firstly, this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen. it incorporates perfectly-timed slapstick, sexual humour, and cleverly-thought-up stand-up. but it goes deeper than that. the souler opposite is an original love story (something we don't see that often) that gave me hope that there is love out there;that two people who love each other can work through their adversity; and that such a comedic take on life (something i believe we all should have) can be accepted by the people that really matter. chris meloni gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer that he should have won an oscar. the film is brilliantly written and i hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future.
