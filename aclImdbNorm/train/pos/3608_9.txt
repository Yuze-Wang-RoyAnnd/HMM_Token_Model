sports movies have never been my thing, but a small handful of them work for me. the best are the those which focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as raging bull, the wrestler and girlfight. this is a great directorial debut for karyn kusama, and an outstanding first performance for michelle rodriguez. girlfight feels is both realistic and involving, that is enough so to make it a memorable film.<br /><br />the plot is strait forward enough. diana guzman, is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her picking fights in the hallway she is close to expulsion. as a possible means of unleashing her anger, she signs up for boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training (at the wishes of there father).<br /><br />in the course of ninety minutes, we the viewers see something extraordinary. diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. we see it in her body as well as her behaviour, especially when one of the boys at the club finds himself drawn to her, and she gets into it. there is not a bad scene or a lame/contrived moment in the film. the only error that i would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note. aside from that, girlfight is a great movie.
