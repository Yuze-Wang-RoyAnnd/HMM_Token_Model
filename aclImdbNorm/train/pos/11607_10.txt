picture bride has an excellent look into hawaii's past and the people who lived there in that time. the time, money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live, takes a whole new meaning to blood, sweat and tears.<br /><br />the concept of dating/matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net. just that is more of snail mail. very slow snail mail.<br /><br />the singing of the plantation's songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers' songs of their demise and future goals.<br /><br />the movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that hawaii can bring. like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility.
