i make just one apology for this film: there are far, far, too many wide angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond endurance, fair enough. they drove me barmy for the first ten minutes or so. but after that i made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film, i had ceased to care. this is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily. it's hilarious, it's witty, the comic delivery of all of the cast is flawless, and however much usher peers at his characters through a cold, fish-eye lens - he may not care for them much - he manages to present them with warmth. `mystery men' is, in fact, not only funnier, not only more clever, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have given it credit for being. the jokes in the austin powers movies, for instance, as well as being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. the satire of `mystery men' bites when there's something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn't. it doesn't mock just any old thing. which is why, contrary to what some (i must regard them as unobservant) critics have said, it never runs out of ideas.<br /><br />the `super' heroes are an attractive bunch. sure, they're second-rate, but they're not merely second rate. the blue rajah, for instance, does nothing but throw cutlery at people, and he isn't that good at it. on the other hand, neither is he comically bad. he's better in his limited field than most people, and he does practise diligently. he's not a buffoon, which makes him a much funnier character than if he was. if superman is christ in a cape, the mystery men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of mount olympus, in capes. much funnier; also much more endearing.
