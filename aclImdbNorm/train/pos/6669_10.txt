i saw this movie the day it came out last year. hilarious i thought. well, now it's on video and i saw it again. i love this movie! the things they do are sometimes dumb but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time. the special effects are okay, but the witty dialog will have you rolling. i'm the kind of person that'll say i'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other stuff, avoid. but for all others, enjoy! the acting is superb. hank azaria is hands down the best (he's neither a commie, nor a fruit) followed by ben stiller (uh, don't correct me. it sickens me) and then william h. macy delivering his best performance (outshining fargo) everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo, but i think kel mitchell was pretty good as invisible boy. two problems: the most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between stiller and claire forlani, and the casanova parole hearing. some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way, but they're a blast. kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it's hilarity is gone, but bam they switch and you're ready for more. i swear after seeing this, you will be tired from the explosive climax (which i think was pretty cool) the camera is pretty cool also, moving at a furious pace with the actors. also, tom waits delivers an outstanding performance (he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him) and like someone else said, the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them. captain amazing is pretty funny, (especially his speech to casanova about his perfect plan-i was rolling) and rush is pretty cool as casanova. one beef: the funniest comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. so all in all, a wonderful movie. i give it twenty stars and hope that someday, everyone will see the brilliance in the film's best parody, the six million dollar man one. laughing right now as i think about it. 20/10
