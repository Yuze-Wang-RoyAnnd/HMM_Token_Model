i thought that it was a great film for kids ages 6-12. a little sappy, but the story is uplifting an fresh. it proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true. i think that it's a great story for any kid who is feelings down, or feels as if there trying to juggle too many things among them. very 'cute' film. bravo.
