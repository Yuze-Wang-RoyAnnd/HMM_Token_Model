indeed: drug use, warehouse shoot-'em-ups, 'matrix'-esque bullet dodging, a futuristic city with a mix of asian races, and a lonely vampire --all in the same movie-- seems like a story that could only be envisioned by a japanese pop/rock star. and that is exactly what 'moon child' is, and more. while all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy b-movie of the week, 'moon child' pulls it off with but a few expected bumps and hitches along the way.<br /><br />the film has a gritty, definitely independent feel to it, jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition, but rather sporadic leaps and bounds, giving glimpses into the characters' lives and barely scraping at a true plot. but the film makes no excuses, instead turning the story into one of friendship, love, trust, and betrayal all sugar-coated in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society, warring gangsters, and vampires.<br /><br />hyde as the somber vampire 'kei' is excellent, giving depth to the character and balancing-out the overly-zealous acting of gackt as 'sho,' an orphan who befriends kei. lee-hom wang also shines as the vengeful 'son' who becomes friends with a grown-up sho. the story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives, and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayal.<br /><br />while the action at times is all-too unrealistic and special effects appear just to show-off, one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular asian singers it features. the superstars as actors have their flaws, and so do their characters. the movie rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping about quite a bit. 'moon child' is rather enjoyable, humorous at times, and even very touching: it is definitely worth your time!
