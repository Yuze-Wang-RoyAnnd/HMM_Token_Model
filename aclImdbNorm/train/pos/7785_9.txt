i've just watch 2 films of pang brothers, the eye and one take only. when i watched the eye, i was kind of disappointed about this two guys, who i had heard good words about them before. that film (the eye) has a really bad script, especially the ending (childish,cliche and too coincident in my opinion) , but its still good in photography and experimental images. so i decided to see one take only and i didn't disappointed again. still great photography, stunning image, mtv-style editing, cool music and this time,the story has a lot of indie spirit,logical and beautiful, you'll see some tiny plot holes, but it doesn't cause any trouble with the storyline. the only problem about this film is i get a bad dvd.
