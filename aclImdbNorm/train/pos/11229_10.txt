with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast. nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work. anyone heard of adobe after effects 7, they should buy it get their keying better.<br /><br />stories are well thought out, plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context. but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode. im not homophobic but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining (dont mind women). anyway... for a fan series this is good stuff. with minor improvement in their green screen, brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning. anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed tng and ds9.
