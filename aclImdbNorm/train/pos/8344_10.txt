this is one of my all time favorites. it is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy. i really like a film full of good quotes and this has it... one of my favorites is when albert einstein says to ed walters "are you thinking what i'm thinking" and ed says "now what are the odds of that happening!" in my opinion, a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it, and with this one, you can!! i also really enjoyed walter m.s way of portraying einstein. i think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely. there are so many times that i find myself smiling right along with the film and quoting my favorite lines as i watch it! i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel-good romantic comedy now and then!
