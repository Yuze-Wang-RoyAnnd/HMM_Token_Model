"magic" isn't too strong a word for the spell this film weaves. you find yourself relaxing, and seeing others in a more benevolent light... any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention. seldom are we soaked in beauty like this. as if that weren't enough, it's funny. performances are, without exception, extraordinary, but special mention must be made of the miraculous miranda richardson, and the superb josie walker - both open like roses.<br /><br />why isn't this film on dvd? it deserves to live forever.
