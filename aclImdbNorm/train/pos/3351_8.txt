very good western.this was the first time writer richard wilson directed a film, also this was a first for samuel goldwyn junior as a producer. it is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty angie dickinson as a saloon girl. robert mitchum comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer, but people are worried that he will go too far, also about the harm that he will do to the town's businesses. there are some similarities in the story with "warlock" which was made in 1959. this film keeps a very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you on the edge.
