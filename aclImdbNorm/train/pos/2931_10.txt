eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life. when i saw it for the first time about 2 years ago i was in stitches for weeks after it. to date i have seen it a further 17 times and i still laugh my ass off each time. for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar. there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle. if you are not the sort of person who can't stand swearing then i wouldn't advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5-10 seconds. i gave this a 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best.
