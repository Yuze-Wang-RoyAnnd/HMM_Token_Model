being a huge fan of the japanese singers gackt and hyde, i was terribly excited when i found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it. i was not disappointed. in fact, this film greatly exceeded my expectations. knowing that both gackt and hyde are singers rather than actors, i was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances, but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on. moon child has just the right amount of humour, action, romance and serious, heart-wrenching moments. i can't say that i've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. the fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters. i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are fans of gackt and hyde.
