this has to be one of my favourite flicks, unlike the weak 'elvira's haunted hills'...anyway i love the way the movie is a goth/com 'wizard of oz' story...<br /><br />elvira is a goth dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a good witch (elviras aunt morgana)...she inherits a "ruby" ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the bad warlock (her uncle)...she befriends four characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow. there is a show down with her uncle (the wicked witch of the west) where elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him. in the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination las vegas (dorothy's home in kansas).<br /><br />there are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie...she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters. elvira: "youe must be aunt em, and you must be uncle remus....there's no place like home, there's no place like home!" bad uncle vinny: "i'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!"<br /><br />there is a sign that elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of kansas.<br /><br />but aside from this, the fact that one of the sequences she "ripped off, um...i mean was inspired by flashdance" is pure genius...and if you don't roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her "very 80's" las vegas show then you haven't got a camp bone in your body...this movie is a cult/camp classic
