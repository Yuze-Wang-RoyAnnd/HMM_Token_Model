this was one of those films i probably never would have picked off the shelf , but it came on ifc one day and i said - eric stolz, william forsythe...why not? if i'd changed the channel, i would have really missed a treasure. <br /><br />the subject is depressing - young author paralyzed in climbing accident convalesces in lower-class rehabilitation center. it would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tear-jerker. but, that doesn't happen because it was written by neal jimenez, after he himself was accidently paralyzed. no hollywood happiness here. all of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds, but they share a feeling of helplessness, of being at the mercy of others. stolz is very good as a "lone wolf" type, forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend (helen hunt); wesley snipes is fine as a former ladies' man whose family is falling apart; but william forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence.<br /><br />see this film.
