from the first scene, i was really excited. "i can tell this is going to be awesome!" i thought. the acting was so good, i felt as though i was eaves-dropping on these peoples' lives. the music too was exquisitely unsettling. the plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward (one could sense) toward some irrevocable fate. the build was slow, but i personally love that kind of thing, as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesn't get derailed before it's ready to pay off.<br /><br />so everything's going fine, and then the fireworks begin, and before you know it, the credits are rolling. "what?!!!" was all i and my movie-night companion could say. if you understand the director's intentions, the blunt ending does make sense (for those of you who have seen the movie already, check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcritic.com), but i can't help saying it was not pulled off quite right.<br /><br />this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax. in any case, it's too bad. those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world. (but for those of you who don't write or make films, you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt, and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal!)<br /><br />wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished. but hay, i'd take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over-produced piece of dog-poo over-compensated with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days).<br /><br />one other comment. some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing. i don't know how to explain it, but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent "monster" forms. although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie--i don't know, it still worked for me in some crooked way. i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again! :)
