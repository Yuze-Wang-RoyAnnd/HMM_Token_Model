i just picked up the dvd release of this movie while on holiday in norway where it has been released with english subtitles.<br /><br />the film is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted. the youngster portraying 'frits' the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him.<br /><br />early on in the film we see that the father whom frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal headmaster denies assaulting the boy and suggests it was his own father.<br /><br />the climactic scene where frits refuses to show any respect to the headmaster; simply standing his ground and repeating 'liar' as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget.<br /><br />the films only weak point is the rather clich'ed 'flower power' teacher who uses every 'friendly teacher' trick in the book. other than this i feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy.
