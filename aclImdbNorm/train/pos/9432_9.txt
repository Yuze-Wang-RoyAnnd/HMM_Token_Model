*spoilers* four men, ed (jon voight), lewis (burt reynolds), drew (ronny cox) and bobby (ned beatty), decide to go on a rafting trip on the cahulawassee river, before it is flooded.<br /><br />they wanted to have fun, to have a nice weekend in the nature.<br /><br />but when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them (bobby), everything begins to go to hell in a handbasket, and this 'nice weekend' will even cost one of the four's life...<br /><br />'deliverance', which in italian is stupidly titled 'un tranquillo weekend di paura' ('a calm weekend of fear'), is the grandad of movies like 'texas chainsaw massacre', 'the hills have eyes', 'wrong turn', 'last house on the left' and all the other 'evil nature/revenge' subgenre films, and one of the scariest, right next to 'the hills have eyes'.<br /><br />based on a book by james dickey (who appears in the movie as sheriff bullard), it's a chilling story on how someone can go into a situation thinking he knows everything, when he doesn't.<br /><br />and the image of the dead man's hand raising from under the water, or the hands holding the rifle from the one-sheet are haunting images that will never leave your mind.<br /><br />deliverance: 9/10.
