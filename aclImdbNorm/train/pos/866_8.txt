put yourself into carla's shoes. she is an overworked, unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible. you know her: she's trained three of her last three bosses, knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth. always having time for another thankless task and does it better than most despite a serious disability, she has the desk on the way to the restroom that becomes the repository of half-finished cups of coffee begging to be spilled. what? you don't want to hear it? well, she can't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place. prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired.<br /><br />carla (emmanuelle devos) needs a change in her life. work is leading nowhere; friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed. she won't take a vacation - a contract is going critical - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. carla submits requirements that convey her real needs: a 'well-groomed' man. this brings an applicant for approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes. <br /><br />paul (vincent cassell) does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates carla's interest in his non-job-related qualities. she sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds, their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co-dependence. <br /><br />paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison: one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt. his skills as a thief help carla win a political battle in the office. but paul sees a grander opportunity with carla's skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue.<br /><br />this is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens. carla grows more powerful, professionally as well as personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us. she grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man's world.<br /><br />the two main characters are meant for each other, in a strange way. without paul, carla will remain in her role of a doormat. she has our sympathy, hopes and best wishes even if she doesn't make the best decisions along the way. <br /><br />you will hear the world through carla's ears, from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid, muffled sounds, all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who's talking. with one major sense disabled, we see carla's heightened intuitive power to compensate. and we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say, but also what they really mean.
