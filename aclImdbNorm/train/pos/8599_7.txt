it's been 19 years since gordon gekko used "wall street" to let us know that greed is good. now, michael douglas takes the gg persona and morphs it into a secret service agent, pete garrison. guess what? it works! this is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. the detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the ss on behalf of the president and first lady was likewise intriguing. all the leads were pretty good but, try as i might, i could not accept eva longoria as a secret service agent. whereas jodie foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was fbi agent starling in "silence of the lambs", you do not get the same feeling with longoria. nevertheless, this is a fun film, escapist entertainment with the beltway as the backdrop.
