being the first feature film with robert de niro (although not released for years later), this is worth the watch. de niro's role isn't huge, yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it. any die hard de niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today.
