"the garden of allah" was one of the first feature length, 3-strip technicolor films. to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature (after disney's 5-year exclusivity deal) was 1935's "becky sharp" which was a costume drama that used the color for it's garish color costumes.<br /><br />"the garden of allah" looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows. it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life. unfortunately, the film does not stand up to the cinematography. that being said, the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat.
