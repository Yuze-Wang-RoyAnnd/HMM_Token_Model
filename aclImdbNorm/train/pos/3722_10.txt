first of all i saw this movie without knowing anything about it i just knew that joel schumacher did it and that was enough for me. a friend and i went to see it at a danish film festival called the night-film festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much specializes in showing movies that wouldn't otherwise be shown in danish theaters.<br /><br />anyway my friend and i went to see it and we were astonished at how real it seemed and that it really struck a cord with our feelings, we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our book.<br /><br />the film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the danish initiative "dogma 95" which was started by 4 danish directors including lars von trier (dancer in the dark).<br /><br />in conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the american g.i. joe coming out of school being expected to serve their country in battle a long way from home.<br /><br />also colin farrell is exceptional in this movie i haven't seen him before but i can't wait to see more of him.<br /><br />lars p. helvard
