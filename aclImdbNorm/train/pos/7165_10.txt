i recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today. i have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch! i am so glad i saw it, and which i could erase my memory and watch i again for the first time. this movie is so wonderful! it reminded me very much of fried green tomatoes at the whistlestop cafe. <br /><br />the story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. some people have said this is a kids movie. i disagree - it may be made by disney and many characters are children, but i am 23 and i loved it! there were moments when my spine tingled. the story is unlike any other film these days, full of adventure. i have just ordered the book from amazon, can't wait!
