fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartley's henry fool. i haven't seen the earlier film, and i don't know if that's a good thing or not. i can only regard the current film on its own merits.<br /><br />for most people, hal hartley's style of film-making is something that you either like or you don't. his combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, ironic humour really resonates with me, and fay grim is no exception. it has an air of sharply-written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud. for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness. it's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakes.<br /><br />during the second half of the film, the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage/conspiracy thriller. whether this was hartley's intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear, but i think a bit of editing or re-writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film's original momentum.<br /><br />the performances were generally good, particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum, who had the most screen time. saffron burrows, james urbaniak, carl montgomery and elina l"owensohn all played good support roles. the film's visuals were nice (set in new york, paris, berlin and istanbul) and the music (also by hartley) was good without being intrusive. the film is well-written and i enjoyed this it immensely. if you like hartley's earlier work, you'll probably like this.
