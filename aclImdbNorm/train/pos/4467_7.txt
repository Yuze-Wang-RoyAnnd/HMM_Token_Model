absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring frank sinatra and gen kelly, as well as kathryn grayson.<br /><br />the film won and oscar for george e. stoll's score, and it garnered nominations for best picture, best actor for kelly, and best cinematography, as well as a best son nomination for "i fall in love too easily" sung by sinatra.<br /><br />it was a cute story about kelly helping his pal sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself. the lovely grayson (the toast of new orleans) dazzled us with her singing, and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by kelly and sinatra, as well as the artistry of pianist-conductor jos'e iturbi.<br /><br />a classic hollywood music from an era gone by.
