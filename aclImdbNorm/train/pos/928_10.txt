i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television, but unfortunately, started a job that got me working evenings. i managed to catch some recordings of it, at least... and, of course, purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series. watching the dvd, you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first, but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done. the voices are well suited to the characters, and the writing is excellent. it's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it's roots by reintroducing adult themes. thing is, with the way society has come in the last century, you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today's standards in order to be recognised as an adult-oriented show. the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life. it's your typical sitcom in that regard, but the humor is more like what you'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live... back when snl was actually funny. good job, dreamworks. perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going... and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it's high costs. it's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though. hmm...
