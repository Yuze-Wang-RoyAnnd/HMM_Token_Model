i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old. unfortunately i could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night. now i bought it on dvd because i can remember that i liked it.<br /><br />this is really not an ordinary horror movie. it has some horror elements but i rather categorize it as fantasy. i liked it but i hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes. especially the scene when anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short.<br /><br />now to the plot. this movie is about a young girl named anna who gets ill. while she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse. when she fells a sleep, which often strangely happens just immediately, she finds herself near the house on a big green field. she realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams. one day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to. as she forgets to draw his legs (because he is sitting behind a window) the boy cannot walk. later she is being told by the doctor, that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn, she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams. she also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams. as she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house. she makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting. she tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn. and next time she falls asleep the horror begins. her father is mad and blind (because she draw s*** on his head to mark him as 'invalid') and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill anna and his friend. her dreams became a horrendous nightmare. they manage to escape and to kill her father and anna can finally wake up. than anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed. the doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so. they tell anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings. anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to. she runs to the watchtower and meets the boy (i am just not mentioning his name because i cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page) and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever.<br /><br />there were a few thing i did not understand in the movie. first of all it was the ending which i absolutely dislike. i think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short. how does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to anna as he is supposed to be dead? why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall? i hated that scene it was so dumb to me. it almost ruined the main horror scene.<br /><br />things i liked were the scene with the photograph of anna's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene. i liked the boy. the actor was awesome. he was even better than anna. i also liked how anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage.<br /><br />overall a good movie. i give it a 8 out of 10.
