this slick and gritty film consistently delivers. it's one of frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking "but i loved get shorty" you need to be punched in the face). in my opinion, no one captures the "feel" for leonard's characters better then john glover in 52 pick-up. the relocation of the story from detroit (novel) to hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights. be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are: swag, rum punch, cat chaser, city primeval, and 52 pick-up. my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate. i also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for dead bang and black sunday.
