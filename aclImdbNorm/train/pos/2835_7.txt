thanks should be given to the hong kong vcd/dvd distributors that i only paid us$1.4 and i could have such a surprisingly delightful enjoyment.<br /><br />adultery? how common in our modern days. eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped nick to chase after luis and charlotte to italy. she wants her revenge done but at the end, she also commits the same crime of luis: she had sex with nick.<br /><br />in this small indie production, vivian naefe dealt with the teething problems in modern marriage with a light heart. how can one dare treat marriage seriously in this fast-food time where people are now of higher mobility in physical, mental and technology areas? conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to circumstances. nick once trusted charlotte but he fell for eva after that kidnap journey which forced him to experience much growth.<br /><br />most viewers may feel happy about the ending because eva and nick come together, well, this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their spouses. however, i want a sequel, i want to see how the four would develop after this exchange. perhaps they may exchange back, how can one be so sure about the shaky love relationship.<br /><br />good acting and good scenery. the two little child-actors should not be neglected especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in venezia. and of course, how can we forget the "bella, bella" scenery of the city.
