i've also been looking to find this movie for quite some time, and how great it would be to find it on dvd...<br /><br />i saw this movie when i was about 6 years old, in the netherlands. and i was very impressed by it. it was shown before walt disney's jungle book! <br /><br />what i remember of this movie is fragmented. i remember that an indian boy was friends with an eagle. this impressed me very much. for some reason he was thrown out of his village (did not grasp the reason for this). when other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped off. at that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend. as an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace. <br /><br />cb
