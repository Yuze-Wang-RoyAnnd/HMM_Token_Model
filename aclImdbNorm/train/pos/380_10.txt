taking a break from his escapist run in the early '80s, steven spielberg directed whoopi goldberg in an adaptation of alice walker's "the color purple", about about the desperate existence of an african-american woman in the 1930s. watching goldberg play celie, it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like "sister act". this is the sort of movie that could easily be - no, make that should be - part of the curriculum in black studies and women's studies. there's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that's ever been on screen (you'll know it when you see it). i can't believe that this didn't win a single oscar; it may be spielberg's second best movie behind "schindler's list" (maybe even tied with it). also starring danny glover, adolph caesar, margaret avery, oprah winfrey, willard e. pugh, akosua busia, and laurence fishburne.
