this movie was a fantastic comedy. it had a lot of comedians star in it like akshay kumar,rajpal yadav,paresh raval and john abraham.<br /><br />rimi sen was good at playing akshay kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses. mr hot as mac (akshay kumar) and mr cool as sam (john abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl maggie (neha dupia). when john abraham cheats on his work he becomes akshay kumars senior and akshay kumar gets really jealous because his flat has to be given to john abraham and neha dupia starts liking john more. akshay kumar wants to be better than john abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls (nitu chandra,nargis bagheri,daisy boppana).
