at the time i am writing this i see out of over 15,000 votes it has a 5.8 rating. something is wrong with that picture. personally i give it a 10. i can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is. it is a movie based on a comic book hero. this movie won more than it's share of awards. won 3 oscars. another 5 wins & 26 nominations .... right there tells me it's better than a 5.8. some great acting from some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come. if you're looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out dick tracy. definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times. al pacino is great as big boy caprice.
