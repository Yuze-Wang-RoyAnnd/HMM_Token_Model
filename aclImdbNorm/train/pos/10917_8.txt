i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region 3 dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it. a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan.<br /><br />the story is pretty straight forward, and has been mentioned already so i won't go into it again. needless to say it's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for, and they do not disappoint. only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed. bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time! all kicks and punches come with the all important "type writer" clicks and air "whooshes", which is a cool effect though quite amusing!<br /><br />i give this movie a b+. good but not great. in a way i feel it could have been that bit better. golden swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had as good a story and better action.
