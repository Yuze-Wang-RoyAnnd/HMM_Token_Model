i saw this movie a few months ago on cable, and it was fantastic. william h macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was just amazing. he makes you care for his character, even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing, and neve campbell gives a performance that is with out a doubt the best performance i have seen by an actress this year. she is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years.<br /><br />donald sutherland is just plain creepy as macy's father, and john ritter is fine as a shrink stuck in the middle of everything that is happening.<br /><br />i wish that this was in the theater because i feel that it's a movie that should be view by a wider audience. that's a shame, because it's a hell of allot better that most of the new movies coming into the theater now.<br /><br />
