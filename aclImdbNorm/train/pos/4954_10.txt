a great, funny, sweet movie with morgan freeman (who plays himself) and who meets a spanish girl named scarlet (paz vega) at a small store whilst researching a potential independent film. i was a bit dubious about the film for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store i really started to enjoy the film. it shows how a positive attitude can change anything. it does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow but will lift the saddest of moods and make you smile all the way through without the need for petty clich'e romance. it includes several scenes all the way through which make you clutch your sides with laughter. a very rare masterpiece!
