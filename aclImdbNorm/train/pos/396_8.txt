legend of zu<br /><br />i remember well tsui hark's original zu warriors made 18 years earlier. over one christmas, on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies, zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable, that it's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog...<br /><br />in fact, i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from. and the memories of seeing yuen biao, sammo hung and others in their classic prime.<br /><br />so when i saw this remake of zu warriors, there was a feeling of apprehension. could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original, or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies?<br /><br />well the answer is i can't say. but that was because this isn't really a remake. the stories (and styles) are almost completely different.<br /><br />the legend of zu tells of the story of king sky, a lone warrior, whose master, dawn, declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia. two hundred years later, insomnia returns, dawn is reincarnated as enigma, and insomnia has returned to destroy zu. meanwhile white eyebrows and red try, with the help of king sky, to stop insomnia.<br /><br />the plot isn't one full of twists and turns, but had enough detail in it to keep me interested. but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate. the film is very much about the special effects, with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments, much like the storm riders and a man called hero. but unlike the other two, this film was one which didn't overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful. nothing appears rushed - unlike hero. the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenes.<br /><br />the story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing. it was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks', but generally each character had its part in the story. but some of the roles appear to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion, and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this.<br /><br />ekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film, but i couldn't say this film showed their best performances. cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting, but it is still quite raw. kelly lin was the new revelation for me. despite her very short role, i have apologise and admit to ogling!<br /><br />overall, i have to say, did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the 'original'. given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark, the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades. and one beauty of that is the fact that you can't really compare the two films at all, as much as apples are apples and pears are pears.<br /><br />ultimately, both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right. and i'm going back to reminisce by watching the original again.<br /><br />two to watch, but not compare.
