sitting on the front porch of his burbank home, ted mapes told me that he and reed hadley wore the exact same size in every item of clothing except hat.<br /><br />ted, one of the greatest of the stunt men, said that every time zorro put on his mask, he was the one on the screen.<br /><br />that was a little bit of an exaggeration: there were times that zorro was obviously reed hadley, but in the stunts we can be satisfied it was ted at work.<br /><br />and what stunts! "zorro's fighting legion" is, as witness the comments here, one of the greatest of serials. it is exciting and generally very well made.<br /><br />reed hadley was a fine actor, and, as someone else commented, he made a very good fop.<br /><br />but, admittedly, it is the action that makes this movie so great.<br /><br />and what else could we expect, with direction by that excellent team, witney and english, with great music from the amazingly prolific william lava (the listing here says he was uncredited, but that is incorrect; those other composers listed here were indeed uncredited, and i don't know if they did write any of the music -- it sounds like lava), and with villainy from, among others, the great charles king, and with dozens of bit parts?<br /><br />also noteworthy was a villain played by the radio tarzan, jim pierce, who was edgar rice burroughs' son-in-law. (i urge you to read his mini-bio.) <br /><br />there is one chapter that slows things down depressingly, but, heck, it's only a few minutes long (maybe 20) and when you wade through it, well, you're back to the excitement.<br /><br />turner classic movies deserves a great big thank you for presenting this excellent serial, and we should ask tcm to bring us more.<br /><br />and we should thank everyone involved that we get to see it as a chapter-play, or serial, and not as a re-cut feature.
