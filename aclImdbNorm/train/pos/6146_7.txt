perhaps disney was hoping for another mary poppins but this is a very different story and while angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great julie andrews. having said that lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance. there is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by david tomlinson. tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer. it does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice. there are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like roddy mcdowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved tessie oshea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again. its also lovely to see sam jaffe and the king of english television bruce forsythe in small roles. the score has a couple of beautiful songs especially the briny sea and the age of not believing. the big number portabello road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality. the effects look a bit clich'e today but the scene with the german invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive. the kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying. i loved the marching song of the home army. the home guard were very important to britain and this is a warm tribute. the animation is delightful, much better than pixar which i find grotesque. a warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage.
