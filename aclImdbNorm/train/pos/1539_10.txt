i saw this at the mill valley film festival. hard to believe this is ms. blom's directorial debut, it is beautifully paced and performed. large cast of characters could be out of an anne tyler novel, i.e. they are layered with back story and potential futures, there are no false notes, surprising bursts of humor amidst self-inflicted anxiety and very real if not earth-shattering dilemmas. if you saw "the best of youth," you will recognize how well drawn the characters are through small moments, even as the story moves briskly along. i really hope this gets distribution in the usa. i live in a fairly sophisticated film market, yet we rarely get swedish films of any kind.
