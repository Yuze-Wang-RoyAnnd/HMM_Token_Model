i sense out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film. yes, there are vampire stereotypes. yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here. even martial arts stereotypes. all well and good, and sure, not all perfectly done. however, i sense one crucial point about this film is being overlooked...the cultural significance of its location. the film is set in pensacola, florida, and does not try to avoid saying so. that's a bold move in the film world today, and a rare treat for fans of indy films. and indeed, it may not be the last. pensacola is world renowned as a navy town, an aviation town, a lumber town, and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy. rarely is it seen as a growing film town. but that's all changing now. more film companies are coming in to shoot. and more native pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves. this film is part of a growing trend of pensacola-based indy films, and more are on the way. pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community, and by and by, the world is taking more notice. watch and listen, world. the pensacolians are coming. like a virus.
