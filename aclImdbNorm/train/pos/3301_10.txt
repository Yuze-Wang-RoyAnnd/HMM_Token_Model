besides the fact that it was one of the few movies that i ever shed a tear over (bye-bye manhood), this is one of the most beautifully crafted indian films that has ever been made. from the finely crafted sets, to those haunting looks meena kumari gives, no one can ever forget it. the music of pakeezah is amazing, all the more if you can understand the sublime poetry, and is definitely one of those "omg, 5 minutes another song" movies. you get the feeling of how trapped sahibjaan is in among all the amazing jewelery she wears and fountained court yard she casually walks past.<br /><br />a parody of all the dreams you've ever had..........
