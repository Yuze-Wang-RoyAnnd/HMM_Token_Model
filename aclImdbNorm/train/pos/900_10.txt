this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now. family and friends feel the same way about it. this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive. shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this, also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies. this is a must see movie, it's a family and romantic movie. this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon. this movie is their best right now... the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction. this movie is must see... recommended to everyone!!
