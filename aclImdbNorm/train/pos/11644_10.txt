this show is awesome! i have been a fan since it premiered, and it only keeps me watching... i've seen some terrible things here, that i wish i hadn't, but, it really shows you how addiction affects all involved, not just the addict. you can see all kinds of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict, or the eating disorder addict. and actually, it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also. we've seen accomplished musicians, an nba player, and even young people, who really need the help. and since they have started showing a few follow-ups, that's been awesome too. now, you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired. if you haven't checked this one out, please do. it's on a&e, and it's awesome! the new eps are sunday nights at 10pm est, if i remember correctly... so set your tivo!
