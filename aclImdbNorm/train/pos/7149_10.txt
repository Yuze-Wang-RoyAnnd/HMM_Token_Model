holes is a wonderful film to see. it has good messages in in, such as: be a good friend, never give up, etc. i highly recommend it to anyone. i still say the book is better than the movie, but the movie gives the book a run for its money. also, khleo thomas plays zero. that really adds to it!!!! lol!!!
