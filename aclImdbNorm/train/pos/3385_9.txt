soylent green i found to be an excellent movie.<br /><br />if you like logan's run you'll like this.<br /><br />yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can somewhat be best described as "cheesy" but the story is excellent.<br /><br />the story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant.<br /><br />at the end the mystery wasn't a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy at the right pace.<br /><br />it's nearest modern day equivalent would be "dark angel" in terms of how the us is shown to be third-world country.
