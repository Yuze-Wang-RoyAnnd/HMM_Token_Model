there were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life (not only in japan, but everywhere). it shows how stifling ones culture can be, and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you.<br /><br />the dancing was just a vehicle for saying "do what you love even if its against the norm". rather billy elliot like i would say. i enjoyed that film as well. <br /><br />the humour was well timed, and the touching moments felt so real, you could feel the awkwardness between sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall. i loved aoki - him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl!<br /><br />the actors all did a wonderful job, the story was well written. i watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that i missed on the first viewing. good entertainment!
