** possible spoilers **<br /><br />i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it. it reminds me of me at 20, except this is even better. like veronica says, two chicks at one time. it brings out the horniness in me, the casual conversation, these two real life chicks, rather than hookers, teasing us every step of the way. i get into the conversations too. even if they are utterly b.s. at times, so what? every chick, just about, that i've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b.s. philosophy. it's just a bunch of nonsense, and about as sensible as that other b.s. philosophy chicks are often into: astrological charts. the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women, he's into the same b.s. and moodiness. the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there.<br /><br />i think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica. she'd love to pull the little blonde away from alexander, but veronica plays her all the way. she's brilliant. she gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them, and then she steals the boy-child/man, which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group. the brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in paris tonight, but i only have this refrain.<br /><br />but do they get married in the end, alex and veronica? mmmm? i can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage breakup. they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones.<br /><br />i like the film though. it kept me entertained, it's got a nice look, and it's sexy.
