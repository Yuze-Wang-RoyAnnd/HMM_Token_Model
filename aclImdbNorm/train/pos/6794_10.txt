i read thru most of the comments posted here & all i can say it that most of these posters have major problems in life. this show, unlike most game show, was fun. mr. shatner, whose brill in all that he does, was again the hit of the show. he's genuinely bubbly personality shines like a beacon where ever he goes. he's fun & makes you smile & that's exactly what the show does also. the dancers & questions, the round-about fashion they're presented only add to the shows appeal. and even though there's a great deal of money at stake it's fun. the pressure (stress) that exists in most game shows does not exist here. several people who posted messages complained how much time is waisted with the dancers & choosing questions, &c, like millionaire doesn't have similar time wasters. all i can say is most of you have missed the whole concept. the idea here is to have fun & enjoy yourself. there's something for everyone. qustions to test your knowledge, eye candy (the dancers), suspense, mr. shatner's wonderful fun-filled personality... well if that doesn't perk-up guys up then i feel bad for you; and if that's not enough, you can get rich! i really miss the show. out of all the games shows that have ever been on, & to be quite frank, i hate game shows, this is the one i really liked & truly miss. the only other game show i ever liked was match game.
