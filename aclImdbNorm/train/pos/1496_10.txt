enjoyed catching this film on very late late late tv and it kept my interest through out the entire picture. this wonderful creepy, yet mysterious looking english home, with evil looking decorations and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder just why anyone would want to rent this home or even own it. there are four(4)tales concerning this house, and each resident of the home meets with all kinds of problems. you will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet singing of birds, but don't let that fool you, there is horror all over the place. peter cushing,"black jack",'80 gives a great performance as one of the person's living in the home and even christopher lee,"curse of the crimson altar",68 and his little daughter, chloe franks,(jane reid) make a wonderful exciting story together, his daughter for some reason loves to read witchcraft books! if you love creepy, horrible and mysterious films, with lots of surprises, this is the film for you!!!!
