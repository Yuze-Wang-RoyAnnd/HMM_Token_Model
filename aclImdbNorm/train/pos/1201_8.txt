the arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the native american residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo... <br /><br />the commercial killers, however, weren't the only ones shooting bison... train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches... there were even buffalo killing contests... "buffalo" bill cody killed thousands of buffalo... some u. s. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds... the buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting... few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once-great bison herds... <br /><br />"the last hunt" holds one of robert taylor's most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept taylor as a heavy guy...<br /><br />his characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter, who kills only for pleasure, had its potential: the will to do harm to another... <br /><br />when he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker (stewart granger) it is evident that these two contrasted characters, with opposite ideas, will clash violently very soon...<br /><br />taylor's shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts... he also enjoy killing indians who steal his horses... he even tries to romance a beautiful squaw (debra paget) who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort...<br /><br />among others buffalo hunters are lloyd nolan, outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner; russ tamblyn as a half-breed; and constance ford as the dance-hall girl... but taylor steals the show... richard brooks captures (in cinemascope and technicolor) distant view of buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animals...<br /><br />the film is a terse, brutish outdoor western with something to say about old western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero...
