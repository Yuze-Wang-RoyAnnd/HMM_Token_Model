i loved that this film recognizes the intelligence of the viewer, allowing the layers to peel from the characters through their interactions with each other about the unspoken loss that has so affected each of them. <br /><br />the cinematography is a beautiful, and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone i believe is an extremely talented new filmmaker with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to accomplish. i see a bright future for this writer/producer/director who had the ability to focus on a goal and accomplish it with integrity.<br /><br />kudos for this achievement.
