methinks the best screen version of quo vadis? ever made. well, yeah, the plot is not so strong and evident as in the book, sometimes meandering and loosing its suspense among aesthetic subtleties. but the film is really and beautifully "strange", has an enigma and style, that other versions - with r.taylor and the new one from poland - definitely lack. it has the air of roman decadence, the beauty of declining paganism and infant christianity. at least i believe it has). brandauer, forrest and syudov did excellent job in portraying their characters. forrest's petronius seems to be the biggest success of the cast (let alone brandauer who is the one of the greatest actors ever) and accumulates the very essence of this dying world (imho). that's it. that is the way it happened, guys... ))) imho
