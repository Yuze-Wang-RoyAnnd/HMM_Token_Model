"dick tracy" is one of our family's favorites -- the actors are great -- the art direction is exceptional -- the music is magic. it's not supposed to be "to kill a mockingbird" -- it's a fun experience.<br /><br />stephen sondhemim's songs are stellar: "back in business" is energetic, "sooner or later" is just right, "what can you lose" is haunting -- even tunes like "live alone and like it" add to the story<br /><br />got to love the giddily over-the-top performances of al pacino, dustin hoffman, glenn headly, charlie korsmo, mandy patinkin, james caan, dick van dyke, supporting villains... the list is far too long. and, yes -- even madonna and warren beatty are awesome. written with a smile a minute (how many times have we looked at each other and said, "wait a minute -- i'm having a thought -- it's gone!"?).<br /><br />however, one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time -- and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer. so, if you haven't already, why not give "dick tracy" a chance -- accept it for what it is -- a sunday comic strip brought to life -- and in a wonderful way!!
