on rare occasions a film comes along that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the very soul. "lou" is such a film. i got "lou" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business. she watched it for a second time with me. we were both enthralled. her as if for the first time again.<br /><br />"lou" is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment at which all of your dramas started taking place. it does this while being relentlessly entertaining. bret carr's acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen. he crafts a character which disarms with a bugs bunny like, stuttering innocence, but warmly carried with such underplayed sincerity that you forget you're watching a movie. when the epiphany hits during the brilliant climax, i saw my wife in tears for the second time.<br /><br />as a life coach, i facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this film is a "must see" for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation. it is a brilliant, creative masterpiece with the power to change lives!
