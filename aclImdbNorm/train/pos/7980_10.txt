man on fire tells a story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom. at first he's not to friendly, but then they befriend with each other, he decides to stop drinking etc., etc... then one day she gets kidnapped... and killed...<br /><br />and he, won't stop at anything to get the revenge.<br /><br />that's basically the story of man on fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry.<br /><br />that's also because of the great music harry-gregson williams with lisa gerrard (gladiator) composed.<br /><br />but the strongest part of the movie... wait... the thing is, everything here is perfect.<br /><br />first - acting. denzel washington is at his best, mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always, great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning. and that's not the end of the list...<br /><br />then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing, should have won an oscar for sure.<br /><br />the story is... not just a revenge movie. the story is intelligent, the story makes you think... and is pure beautiful. really.<br /><br />this is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime, at least once!
