worry not, disney fans--this special edition dvd of the beloved cinderella won't turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight. one of the most enduring animated films of all time, the disney-fide adaptation of the gory brothers grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right, thanks to some memorable tunes (including "a dream is a wish your heart makes," "bibbidi-bobbidi-boo," and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. the famous slipper (click for larger image) we all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. there are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. it's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named lucifer. there's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the king and the grand duke. it's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying.
