i have seen dirty work several times and is probably my favourite stan and ollie short.<br /><br />in this one, stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of professor noodle (lucien littlefield). while noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab, stan and ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room. the end is where ollie falls into a tank of special formula that noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp! the best part is where ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head, but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this.<br /><br />dirty work is stan and ollie at their funniest. great fun.<br /><br />rating: 5 stars out of 5.
