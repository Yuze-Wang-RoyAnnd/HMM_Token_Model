the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension. ripstein's lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who, like the colonel, suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose. unlike the absurdity of waiting for godot, the colonel's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life. two things in the film drive the colonel who is masterfully played by fernando lujan; the hope that his military pension will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son, agustin, died for a noble cause, a reason other than a drunken fracas at a rigged cockfight. unable to realize the former, and forced to prove to the world the latter, the colonel does the only thing he can do, set about training his son's fighting cock. the cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the colonel and his asthmatic wife, but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner, agustin. in a tense scene of confrontation between the colonel and nogales, his son's killer, the colonel is offered by nogales, a paid government agent, money enough to equal the colonel's full pension. but, this is blood money; hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals, and to conceal to the world that the warrior colonel's son was assassinated because he wrote for an underground paper that favored the rights of labor unions and the common man. with maximum dignity, the colonel rejects nogales' offer, picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him. once he is at home, dona lola, his scolding wife, wants to know why the colonel refused the money when both of them are starving. in response to her continued question, "what are we going to eat until november (when the cockfighting season begins)", the colonel responds, "shit." excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives, and excrement is a meal that the colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity, knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him. the colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles.
