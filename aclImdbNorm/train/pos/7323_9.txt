brutal, emotionless michael myers stabs his sister to death at age six on halloween night in 1963; on october 30, 1978, he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of haddonfield, illinois. he is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist (donald pleasence) who knows just how evil this young man is.<br /><br />it opens with a bang, and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire. it's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were; subtle, and scary. it retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings. how many movies are there, really, that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before? not very many.<br /><br />pleasence is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; jamie lee curtis, in her motion picture debut, became a bona fide scream queen after acting in "halloween" as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures, and she is an intended victim worth rooting for.<br /><br />co-writer / director john carpenter knows what works in this movie, making excellent use of shadows and dark skies; notice how most of the movie is set after nightfall. with this picture, he and his former collaborator debra hill created a franchise that has spawned seven sequels, many imitators, and an upcoming "re-imagining".<br /><br />it's very quotable - who could ever forget dr. loomis' (pleasence) speech in which he describes michael myers to the sheriff (charles cyphers, a reliable repertory player in several of carpenter's earlier works)?<br /><br />it's fantastic, and worth seeking out. this is my favorite john carpenter movie of all time.<br /><br />it's not totally infallible - there are script holes, after all - but overall it makes a solid impact.<br /><br />9/10
