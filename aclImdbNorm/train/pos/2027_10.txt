what can be said of the compelling performance of tara fitzgerald? she is utterly believable as the injured mrs graham, hardened by experience, sharp and strong-willed, yet not immune to the passionate attentions of mr markham. through every mischievous glance and every flare of temper, every flicker of discernment in his eyes and telling facial expression, toby stephens is a master of his character. he is the force of passion and hope that will restore helen's injured spirit. graves' huntingdon is a perfect performance of the unreformable rogue. yet despite all he has done, there is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite at the end; he is at least aware of his own failings and how they have brought his ruin. helen's attempt to save his soul-- after leaving him and taking their child at a time when this was unheard of--is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the worth of every human life and soul, however misguided, however sinful that person may be. markham's constancy may then be seen as her reward for her faith and unyielding moral character. though the opinionated ideas of morality so strongly presented in tenant seem outdated by today's standards, the story is imbued with integrity, passion, and conviction which still make an impact. tenant is far more believable than wuthering heights or even jane eyre; here is an adaptation that does the novel justice. i highly recommend viewing it!
