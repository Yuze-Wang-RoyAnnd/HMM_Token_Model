this is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders. the storyline centres on a deranged man who lives in texas, us who suddenly goes on a killing spree with his two young sons after being instructed by god to redeem the world of bad people.<br /><br />bill paxton who directs this movie plays the deranged father who is known as the hand of god killer while matthew mcconaughey plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son, fenton meiks. the film revolves around fenton who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hauntingly tell the story to fbi agent wesley doyle (played by powers boothe).<br /><br />i cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them. even if you want to stop watching, you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie.<br /><br />the directors have filmed this movie very well, and they help to set the plot through the good scenery. the acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people.<br /><br />whilst the concept of this film is very dark, the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting. this really is a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout. i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror, disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different.<br /><br />8/10
