a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors, such as misa shimizu and nagiko tono. after 15 minutes of watching, your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the destiny will bring to the characters. this film makes you leave your position as a standard audience, it takes you in, it makes you a part of the story... costumes and settings are brilliant; especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built. it is definitely not very akira kurosawa, however it still gets a lot from the master, especially the stylistic story telling tells us we're in a distinguished land of cinema which is quite far from hollywoodish flamboyance.
