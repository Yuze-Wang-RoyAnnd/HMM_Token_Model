i think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial africa in the 50's and 60's rather than as a story. because there is no real story here. just one vignette on top of another like little points of light that don't mean much until you have enough to paint a picture. the first time i saw chocolat i didn't really "get it" until having thought about it for a few days. then i realized there were lots of things to "get", including the end of colonialism which was but around the corner, just no plot. anyway, it's one of my all-time favorite movies. the scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry. if you like "exciting" movies, don't watch this--you'll be bored to tears. but, for some of you..., you can thank me later for recommending it to you.
