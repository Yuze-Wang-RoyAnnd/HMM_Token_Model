i like the movie. twisted desire had jeremy jordan,one of my favorite and one of the cutest actors ever. melissa joan hart is a good actress. i've seen most of her movies but all of jeremy jordan's. the thing i dislike about twisted desire is when "nick" gets arrested and "jennifer" rats him out. twisted desire is my second favorite movie. my first is the goonies. but i still love jeremy jordan.
