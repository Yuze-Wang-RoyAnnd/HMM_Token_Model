maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i've been feeling down in the dumps and it's such a lovely little fairytale. whatever the reason, i thought it was pitch perfect. great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially de niro, who is awesome). this movie made me happier than i've been for a while.<br /><br />it is a very funny and clever movie. the running joke of the kingdom's history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled. that's much of what makes it so good; it's an elaborate, special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies, yet there is an incredible attention to small things.<br /><br />i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again.
