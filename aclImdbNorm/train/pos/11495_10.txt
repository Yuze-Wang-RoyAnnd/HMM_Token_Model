we saw this at one of the local art movie theaters in the montrose area of houston, tx. it was a total surprise compared to the write-up in the theater's newsletter but we were both blown away by the artistry. it was beautifully done and (apparently) photographed in a schloss (german name for ch^ateau) somewhere in the munich area. it is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twentyish men and women isolated from the day-to-day constraints. it is fantastic on more levels than i can remember. we came home after the movie and talked and talked until about 4 am the next morning.<br /><br />the version we saw was in english (mostly) so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the movie in (probably its original) german version. i searched and searched for a video tape version but never came up with anything. would absolutely love to have a vhs or dvd version of this. it explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner. if anyone knows the writer/director, please convince him to release again, preferably on dvd these days. i cannot even imagine getting tired of watching the candid performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties. please, please bring it back.
