i saw this on a cantonese vcd with the english subtitles. i thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting. this took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie. if the musical score was improved i could overlook the few overacted scenes. then the film would be much, much better.
