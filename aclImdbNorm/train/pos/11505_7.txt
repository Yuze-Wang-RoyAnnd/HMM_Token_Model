a couple of years back i had purchased (and enjoyed) the mgm double-feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies, the night stalker (1971) and the night strangler (1972). when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out, i had intended to buy it immediately - but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd-18s kept me from adding it to my collection; recently, i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak 3-discer as well.<br /><br />having watched it now, i can safely say that i didn't regret acquiring this beloved (if short-lived) crime/horror series one bit: it may follow a standardized formula - dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak, marvelously played by darren mcgavin, gets into everybody's hair with his attitude (flustered editor simon oakland, long-suffering colleagues, assorted authoritarian figures, a plethora of monsters and villains), faces up to the inevitable (and usually supernatural) threat alone but, finally, is pressured into keeping his story under wraps - but a winning one (further boosted by an impressive line-up of guest stars and notable behind-the-scenes credits), making the show a great deal of fun.<br /><br />that said, quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make-up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired (for instance, the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment) - not to mention the fact that these were restricted to 50-minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes (in the case of the werewolf, again, he's never seen biting anyone but, somewhat foolishly, is made to merely throw people around)! <br /><br />while the hero's cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots, there's a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode (often, but not exclusively, revolving around mcgavin's relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage) - to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere (the setting, for the most part, is chicago) and suspense. to make the ride even more pleasant, there's a bouncy score by gil melle' and jerry fielding.<br /><br />for the record, the monsters encountered (but not always defeated) by kolchak throughout the series are: a revived jack the ripper, a variety of cults (voodoo, native american, aztec), aliens, vampire, werewolf (going round its over-familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise-liner!), doppelganger, satanist, swamp creature, mass of electricity, robot, apeman, witch, headless motorcyclist, succubus, a knight's armor taking a murderous life of its own (the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast - featuring john dehner as a morose police captain, hans conried and robert emhardt), helen of troy(!) and crocodile. some of the actors (other than those playing kolchak's co-workers) return in the same roles - keenan wynn and ramon bieri (both as officers of the law), john fiedler (as a shrewd morgue attendant) and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero. if i were pressed to choose the finest (or most entertaining) episodes, i'd lean towards horror in the heights (co-starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer) and the afore-mentioned the knightly murders - while, as the weakest, i'd go for the werewolf (due to reasons i've already explained) and chopper (based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale!).<br /><br />unfortunately, the set contains no extras: it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak: the night stalker, as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing, or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci-fi series popular today. in fact, kolchak himself - in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise - returned in a 2005 revival; this version is available at my local dvd rental outlet...but, for various reasons, i'm not sure i'd want to check it out so soon after the 1974-5 classic!
