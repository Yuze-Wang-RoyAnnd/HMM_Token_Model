this game is one of the best rpg. fist, it is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system (you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack, you can transform into dragoon, the special attack, the magic...). the script is very good. characters are all lovely and you have no long dialogs to support, as happened in several games of final fintasy series. i got bored of that dialogs about past, when you just want to go on with the game's story. ambientation is a jewel on this game, it combines middle-age fantasy with futuristic science fiction. it's remarkable that animation effects are just incredible, i like them more than other in other modern games (we can't remember that legend of the dragoon is 8 years now). then, map is huge, there are all kinds of places an enemies. finally, music is not the best game muse i have heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
