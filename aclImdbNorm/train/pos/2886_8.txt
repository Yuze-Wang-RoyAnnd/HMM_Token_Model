cinderella is a beautiful film, with beautiful songs of course. in fact, it's one of the best films of the 1950's.<br /><br />i think all the characters are portrayed amazingly. you can see the cruelness of cinderella's stepsisters and her stepmother, the sweetness of cinderella. the mice are funny and sweet too.<br /><br />i think they changed the tale a bit, but i think it's for the best. it's such a nice film, and i don't think anyone could resist it deep down.<br /><br />i give it a 8/10. i don't think it's the best disney film. but it sure is a true classic.
