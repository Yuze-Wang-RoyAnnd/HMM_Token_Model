it's hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does. she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. that notwithstanding, yes, the plot was predictable. i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was, which would have added more to the suspense. it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richard's little problem with his ex-wife, maybe a bit more back story. i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie. i would have liked to have seen more closure with zack's death and possibly closure with her husband. i do have to say though, i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there. it was a very fitting end for richard. of course, mitzi rocked! i am so looking forward to her future projects.
