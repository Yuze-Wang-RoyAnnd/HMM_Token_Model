a family (mother-patricia clarkson, father-jake weber, son-erik per sullivan) go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter. they accidentally hit a deer while driving there. this angers some of the locals--especially otis (john speredakos) and things slowly (very slowly) go wrong.<br /><br />i was expecting the worst when i started watching this. the bulk of the reviews for this, on this site, are extremely negative. well...i disagree. first off it's not a horror film. the horror doesn't even begin until the closing 30 minutes. it plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in. on that level, it's pretty damn good.<br /><br />first--the bad stuff: the pace is way too slow; jake weber is a horrible actor; way too many false dream sequence scares; the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view we get of the wendigo at the end is laughable.<br /><br />the good stuff: pretty good dramatic script; clarkson is excellent as the mother; some great direction with eerie sound effects which are a little scary; a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between clarkson and weber (which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot!); pretty good acting by sullivan (only 10 at the time!) and speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending.<br /><br />i think many people are annoyed with this film because it's being pushed as a horror film--which it isn't. so, if you can ignore that, i think you might like it. i'm giving it a 7.
