time for a rant, eh: i thought spirit was a great movie to watch. however, there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 (i'm being a little bit generous with the 7).<br /><br />point #1: matt damon aggravates me. i was thinking, 'what a dicky voice they got for the main character,' when i first heard him narrate - and then i realized it is matt damon. the man bugs me so very bad - his performance in "the departed" was terrible and ruined the movie for me (before the movie got a chance to ruin itself, but that's another story for some other time), as it almost did "spirit". i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was... thankfully.<br /><br />point #2: brian adams sucks... the whole score was terrible... the songs were unoriginal, generic, and poorly executed; not once did i find the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible. every time one of the lame songs came on, i was turned off. i almost thought i'd start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-american freedom style lyrics (i couldn't help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9/11). in light of the native american aspects of the film, they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments, not petty radio-hit, teen-bop, 14-year-old-girl crap. i thought i was back in junior high school. i can't believe no better could have been done--i refuse to. had it not have been for this, i'd rank the film up more with disney, which knows a thing or two about originality (ok, don't bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking ;). too bad, it's a shame they couldn't have hired better musicians.<br /><br />i liked the art and animation, except for some things here and there... like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick/dark lines mainly near the end). there were often times when i thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion. but there were also times when the emotion ran thick. anyhow, many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent.<br /><br />ok, i'm falling asleep here so i'll sum it up before i start making less sense...<br /><br />nice try on an epic film... it turned out mediocre though. matt damon, you suck!
