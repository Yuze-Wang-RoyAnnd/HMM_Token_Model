i've watched almost all of the gundam/mech anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story. the way its plot twists and turns has u riveted. gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war. the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as gundams. the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as oz. as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots, new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate. old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting. but, how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal. i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot.
