a serious comedy. ross hunter-produced movie version of the french play "les joies de la famille" (later americanized as "a very rich woman") is plush, well cast, occasionally funny...and unfortunately timeless. a wealthy california widow, who appears to be frittering away her money, is railroaded by her two grown, greedy daughters, both of whom are afraid mama rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance. the whole issue of a vital--but aged--woman sent to a rest home against her will, and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing, is touchy material for a comedy (and to his credit, director david lowell rich doesn't overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment). some of the humor is a little broad and doesn't work, yet rosalind russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note. sandra dee is also good as rosalind's granddaughter, and james farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly, and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time, that the seriousness of "rosie!"'s theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending. the picture leaves you smiling--and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky. *** from ****
