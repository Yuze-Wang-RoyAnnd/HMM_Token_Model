i remember that the trailer for legend of zu was quite impressive and being a fan of a man called hero (my all time favourite), storm riders i decided that i must watch this one too. i know that there is way to much critcism on ekin cheng's acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite hong kong moviestar so far (way better than nicolas tse nevertheless)and he is one of the factors that i enjoyed this movie. without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. i even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film. they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that. the storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in (i guess ekin cheng pulls the girls easily).the story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie. i wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities, but well that's life and it never goes the way you want it to. and why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end ? that's way too funny. legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all. if a company decides to publish games on this movie i will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements. good work. please make more fantasy movies like this
