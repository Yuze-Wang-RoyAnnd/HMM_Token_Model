how does an usual day start in point place, wisconsin...<br /><br />first of all, red, the tyrannical father of the forman family and a wwii veteran, sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife kitty serves breakfast. then comes their skinny son, eric, he sits at the table as well, and his father starts his daily yelling, usually involving placing his foot in eric's behind if (insert reason here). if his promiscuous angel-faced sister laurie is at home, she comes along, then red stops yelling and kindly talks to her, making eric feel left out of the family.<br /><br />once this daily (painful) ritual is over, eric rushes down to his basement, where all his friends are already hanging out. and when we get to see them, it becomes obvious eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend, next-door neighbor and childhood friend donna pinciotti are the sanest people around. meet steven hyde, the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesn't really care about what's around as long as it's not funny to watch; michael kelso, the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees; jackie burkhardt, the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around, spoiled kid of a rich father, and, of course, cheerleader; and fez, a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and can't keep a secret. at first they simply hang out, gossiping and making fun of kelso, but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin... before going out doing something they'll regret later.<br /><br />meanwhile red goes out and meets donna's weirdo parents, bob and midge. he's rude, but they don't mind, as they think he's joking. somewhere around is leo, an aging hippie, who's constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing.<br /><br />did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters? of course, most seem "clich'ed", but the show takes the clich'e to a new level. now throw in some of the most wicked story lines a sitcom can offer, sit down and enjoy one of the best tv shows ever. the one that never does two times the same thing and which is, compared to most sitcoms that are "cute funny", purely hysterical. if you get hooked, don't let this show let you go. bite on the hook over and over and, man, you will see the sitcom genre from a whole new prospective.
