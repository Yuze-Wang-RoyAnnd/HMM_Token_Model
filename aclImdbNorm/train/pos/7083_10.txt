a great addition to anyone's collection.<br /><br />12 monkeys is a movie you don't see every day. it has excellent actors to go with a excellent story. this is not a normal role for bruce willis but he holds the role like he holds john mcclane.<br /><br />the virus-kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it.<br /><br />a man(bruce)is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind.<br /><br />the actors in this were awesome. i must give a mention to brad pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient james cole(bruce) meets in a mental hospital.<br /><br />the director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus.<br /><br />the animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities.<br /><br />this movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own.<br /><br />i very much highly recommend it.<br /><br />10/10
