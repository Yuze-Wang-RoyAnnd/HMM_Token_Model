from the opening shots of the lead actor, we are given a early view on how so many mens lives are run by the women in them, and the humour that comes thru with all that goes on in the day to day of 'normal' life.<br /><br />eric lartigau, the director picks up on how so many european men feel that they are in complete control of their lives, yet without the help/support of the women around them cannot seem to make things work. the use of facial image throughout the film is superb, and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family (mother) is spot on.<br /><br />while there are more than enough laughs in the movie, it still deals with single parents/adoption and the strength of family in society. truly rewarding to watch, and again one that only the french seam capable to make.<br /><br />so far one of the best 50 or so films i have seen this year, and well worth a five start rating. i look forward to adding this one to the dvd collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages.
