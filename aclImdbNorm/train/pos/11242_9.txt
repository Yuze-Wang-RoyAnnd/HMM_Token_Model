anyone interested in pop music, and not familiar with british music trends of the late-seventies, should be sure to watch breaking glass at least once. the movie, about a young woman's quest to make her mark in the music world, captures the times perfectly, from the overt sexism, rough economic times, social upheaval, to the shift in pop culture from rough-and-tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious futurism/new romanticism. the music and fashion styles created daily in britain in the late-seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled (there really has been nothing new since 1980). this was a dazzling time, and breaking glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape, and does both extremely well.
