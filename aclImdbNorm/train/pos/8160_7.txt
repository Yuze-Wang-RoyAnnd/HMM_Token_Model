brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore-fests, but the truth is that his films actually aren't bad at all. the re-animator sequels aren't as great as the original, but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned. return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series; and society isn't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece. this thriller certainly isn't a masterpiece; but it shows yuzna's eye for horror excellently, and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging. i'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn't turn up until 1996, as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it's running away from a tiger for the modern world. dentistry doesn't frighten me, but surprisingly; i would appear to be in the minority. the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone. he has a nice house, a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want. however, his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool cleaner. and his life isn't the only one; as it's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger...<br /><br />when it comes to scaring the audience, this movie really makes itself. however, credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme. the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that i'm not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline, only with the dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we're seeing. it isn't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this won't be winning any awards, the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot. the acting, while b-class, is actually quite impressive; with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge. i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie. the dawn of the dead star doesn't get enough work, and i really love seeing him in films. the rest of the cast doesn't massively impress, but all do their jobs well enough. overall, the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies. the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans, and i don't hesitate to recommend this film.
