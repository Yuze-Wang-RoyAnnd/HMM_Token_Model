can i be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say "i liked it"? it's reasonably funny by bits, it got great stars and it's gorgeous to look at. the songs (there are about two which are then repeated) are forgettable, but they get a healthy ironic treatment (such as the terribly handsome mr fairbanks exploding into frenzied wagnerian version of the tender ballad miss grable has just rendered); there isn't much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around miss grable, and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed, but the result still is very uplifting. the photography (including real outdoor shots which are a thrill) is amazing, playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold. miss grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental "olde worlde" comedy. it's pretty much along the line of "down to earth" with rita hayworth, and that one tends to be rather disliked by many. so i suppose several people would deem "that lady in ermine" to be outdated and stuffy. but it's a fairy tale, and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow. my suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, the costumes, the witty script and everything else this film has to offer, and stop complaining. the film has been released on dvd in germany, with both german and english soundtrack.
