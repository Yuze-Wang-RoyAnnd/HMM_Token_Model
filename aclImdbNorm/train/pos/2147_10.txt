i lived in tokyo for 7 months. knowing the reality of long train commutes, bike rides from the train station, soup stands, and other typical scenes depicted so well, certainly added to my own appreciation for this film which i really, really liked. there are aspects of japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you don't have to speak japanese to enjoy this movie. director suo's tricks were subtle for the most part; i found his highlighting the character called tamako tamura with a soft filter, making her sublime, a tiny bit contrived but most of the directors tricks were so gentle that i was fully pulled in and just danced with his characters. or cried. or laughed aloud. wonderful. a+.
