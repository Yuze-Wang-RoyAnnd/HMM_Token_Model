gung ho is one of those movies that i never get tired of watching. michael keaton has always been a favorite of mine, & he is absolutely hilarious in this movie. matching him step for step is gedde watanabe. the two of them work wonderfully together. although this movie is a comedy, i also like how it shows hunt (keaton) & kazihiro (watanabe) struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups. they both try so hard to keep the peace, & then they finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to watch). first, they're both on the floor. then hunt jumps on a chair. kazihiro jumps on the desk. hunt jumps on the desk with him. the fight then spills out from the office into the factory. i love that after they are separated by the workers, you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand. also, there is a scene where you can see the influence that hunt has had on kazihiro. he is at his house & his boss from japan arrives & says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /><br />kazihiro: tomorrow not good day. sakamoto: why not? kazihiro: factory is locked & we can't find key.<br /><br />tell me you can't picture michael keaton saying something like that!<br /><br />i guess i really like this movie because it is genuinely funny, & also shows how people that are radically different can not only learn from each other, but become good friends as well.
