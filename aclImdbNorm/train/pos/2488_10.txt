to me, the final scene, in which harris responds to the press corp, is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics(especially the campaign phase). if only the "real-life" pols would respond in the intelligent, articulate manner as did mr harris,then the arrogant, self-serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant, confrontational "garbage" that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he/she is pursuing.
