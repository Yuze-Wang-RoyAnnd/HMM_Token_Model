the stories in this video are very entertaining, and it definately is worth a look! the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks, with a great, but unexplained twist at the end.<br /><br />the seond is the best of the lot, and it alone, makes this worth watching - a man is attacked by a dog, which he fears to be rabid - he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital, but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be...... great twist at the end, and this episode alone scores 10/10! if the others were up to par with this one, this would get 10/10!<br /><br />the third is the weakest of the bunch - a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex! there appears to be no point to the story until the end, with a good little twist, but it is spoiled by the awful first part!<br /><br />never the less, this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all! well worth a rental!
