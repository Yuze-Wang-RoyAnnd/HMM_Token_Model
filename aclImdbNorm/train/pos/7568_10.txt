saw this my last day at the festival, and was glad i stuck around that extra couple of days. poetic, moving, and most surprisingly, funny, in it's own strange way. it's so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world, without seeming precious, or upsetting the balance. manages to seem both improvised, yet completely controlled. it i hesitate to make comparisons, because these filmmakers have really digested their influences (cassavetes, malick, loach, altman...the usual suspects) and found their own unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (lynne ramsay, david gordon greene), you're in for a real treat. this is a wonderful film, and i hope more people get to see it. if this film plays in a festival in your city, go! go! go!
