i went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night. i didn't really hear much about it. so i wasn't expecting anything. but after i saw it, i really liked it. nicolas cage and the rest of the cast were very good. but i do have to say giovanni ribisi's acting performace did need a little perking up. but such a small flaw, it could be overrided. <br /><br />gone in 60 seconds is about a retired car thief who must boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. the movie is in no way predictable. so the ending should be a suprise. think it's just another, fast car driving movie? well you are partially right. there is much more to it. everyone should take a look at this movie.
