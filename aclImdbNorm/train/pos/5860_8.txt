an enjoyable game, which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay ability. staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action cartridges today. also, the narration and animated scenes used (though lengthy animations are replaced by slide shows on the nintendo 64 version) use full advantage of the platforms' capabilities.
