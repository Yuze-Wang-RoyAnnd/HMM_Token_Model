i thought it was a very funny movie. i love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good. k-9, k-911, and k-9 pi are my favorite movies. jim belushi is hysterical and jerry lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team. the only downside is that i really didn't understand how dooley's wife died. she died before this movie but how? if they said it i must have missed it. other than that i give it two thumbs/tails up! those dogs (jerry lee and zeus) must have had a lot of training. they were so funny and all the noises jerry lee would make when dooley was talking to him was so funny. my favorite was when jerry lee sang and when he would bite peoples privates to get information very very funny lol
