made only ten years after the actual events, and set in the bunker under the reichstag, pabst's film is wholly gripping. it reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war. haven't seen this in over three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. the characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave. searing bit of dialog between two generals: "does god exist?" "if he did, we wouldn't." shame this is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about traudl junge, "im toten winkel" {aka "blind spot: hitler's secretary") and "downfall" with bruno ganz.
