i'm disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film. jordi moll`a, probably best known for his role as diego in ted demme's "blow" writes, directs, and stars.<br /><br />i won't give away any plot points, as the movie (at least for me) was very exciting having not known anything about it.. if you have a netflix account, or have access to a video store that would carry it...i highly recommend it. it's a crazy, fun, and sometimes very thought provoking creation.<br /><br />moll`a's direction is *quite* impressive and shows a lot of promise.<br /><br />unpredictable, with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful spanish "no somos nadie" (god is on air) is an amazing film you can show off to your friends.<br /><br />see it.
