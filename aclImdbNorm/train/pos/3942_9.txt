1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in hollywood history, with more classic films released than in any other, and john ford directed three of the best, "stagecoach", "drums along the mohawk", and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the union, "young mr. lincoln".<br /><br />with the world plunging into a war that america dreaded, but knew it would be drawn into, abraham lincoln was much on people's minds, in 1939, as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life, and had triumphed. on broadway, robert e. sherwood's award-winning "abe lincoln in illinois", with raymond massey's physically dead-on portrayal, was playing to packed houses (it would be filmed in 1940). carl sandburg's continuation of his epic biography, "abraham lincoln: the war years", was published, and quickly became a best seller. president roosevelt frequently referred to lincoln in speeches, and the lincoln memorial, in washington, d.c., became the most popular landmark in town (a fact that frank capra made good use of, in "mr. smith goes to washington").<br /><br />all this was not lost on darryl f. zanuck, at 20th century fox; as soon as he read lamar trotti's screenplay of lincoln's early days as a lawyer, he designated it a 'prestige' production, and assigned john ford to direct, and henry fonda, to star.<br /><br />fonda did not want to play lincoln; he felt he couldn't do justice to the 'great emancipator', and feared a bad performance would damage his career. even a filmed make-up test, in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble lincoln, wouldn't change his mind. according to fonda, john ford, whom he'd never worked with, cussed him out royally, at their first meeting, and explained he wasn't portraying the lincoln of legend, but a young "jackanape" country lawyer facing his first murder trial. humbled, fonda took the role. (john ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the outcome was the same!) obviously, they found a chemistry together that worked, as nearly all of their pairings would produce 'classics'.<br /><br />unlike the introverted, melancholia-racked lincoln of "abe lincoln in illinois", ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney, who made friends easily, and misses the mother he lost, too young (resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story). injustice riles him, and he speaks 'common sense' to quell violence, interlaced with doses of humor. both productions play on lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with ann rutledge; in ford's version, the pair are truly in love, and committed to each other. after her death, lincoln would frequently visit her grave, to share his life with her 'spirit' (a theme ford would continue in "she wore a yellow ribbon").<br /><br />a murder trial is the centerpiece of the film, and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director. fonda deftly portrays lincoln's inexperience, yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy, and ford emphasizes the gulf between the big-city 'intellectuals' (represented by pompous d.a. donald meek, and his slick 'advisor', stephen douglas, played by a young milburn stone), and the informal, rule-bending country sense of lincoln. with ford 'regular' ward bond as a key witness, the trial is both unconventional, and riveting.<br /><br />with the film closing as lincoln strides away into the stormy distance, and his destiny (dissolving into a view of the statue at the lincoln memorial), audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just, good would ultimately triumph.<br /><br />"young mr. lincoln" is a truly remarkable film, from an amazing year!
