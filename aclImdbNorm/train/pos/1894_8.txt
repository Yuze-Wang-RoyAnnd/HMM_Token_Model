i remember trying a few minutes of this film, i'm very surprised i didn't watch all of it, from director steve gordon, his only film directed before dying of heart failure. basically arthur bach (golden globe winning, and oscar nominated dudley moore) is the happy drunk millionaire with everything he could want, a mansion, a butler hobson (oscar and golden globe winning, and bafta nominated sir john gielgud), and plenty of booze. he is to inherit $750,000,000 if he marries the daughter of fellow millionaire burt johnson (stephen elliott), they woman he and the family have chosen, susan (jill eikenberry). but instead, arthur finds himself falling for queens waitress linda marolla (golden globe nominated liza minnelli), which of course is threatening the inheritance, and 3/4 of his family's fortune from father stanford (thomas barbour) and aunt martha (geraldine fitzgerald). after the death of hobson, arthur, on the day of the wedding, disobeys the family's wishes, but aunt martha still gives arthur the inheritance to live happily ever after with true love linda. also starring ted ross as bitterman, barney martin as ralph marolla, anne de salvo as gloria - hooker, maurice copeland as uncle peter bach, justine johnston as aunt pearl bach, florence tarlow as mrs. nesbitt, marcella lowery as harriet - martha's maid, john bentley as perry and peter evans as preston langley - party guest. moore is wonderfully funny and a little cringing as the almost always drunk millionaire, minnelli is likable as the woman he loves, and gielgud of course makes a great oscar winning impression as moore's humorous humble sarcastic servant, a terrific screwball comedy. it won the oscar for best song for "arthur's theme (best that you can do)" (it also won the golden globe) (it was number 79 on 100 years, 100 songs), and it was nominated best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen, it was nominated the bafta anthony asquith award for film music for burt bacharach, and it won the golden globe for best motion picture - comedy/musical. sir john gielgud was number 35 on the 50 greatest british actors, and the film was number 53 on 100 years, 100 laughs. very good!
