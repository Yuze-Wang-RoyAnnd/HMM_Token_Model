ang lee clearly likes to ease into a film, to catch action, characters and setting on the hoof, as they emerge. covering the haphazard endgame of the american civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia, unformed in mind or manhood, this is an ideal approach. the film turns out to be about the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the mid-south as a silent character, enduring the strife like a hardy parent.<br /><br />james schamus' script is probably the standard bearer for this film; close behind it are a number of well-appointed performances that carry it admirably. jeffrey wright's name alone could carry this film for me. he's brilliant here but in a slow burning role: instead we are treated to very good (if not revelatory) performances from a large, often recognisable ensemble.<br /><br />a noble, optimistic film. one to watch if you don't fancy the harder, more bittersweet cold mountain or the claim, for example. 7/10
