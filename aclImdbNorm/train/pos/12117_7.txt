although this film put davis on the map due to her brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate guttersnipe waitress/prostitute mildred rogers, this film is strangely unsatisfying to me as a whole. the acting is indeed fine in most every respect. what i cannot fathom for the life of me is just how or why phillip, a sensitive, well-bred young man would take the constant abuse this tramp constantly dishes out towards him: i find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in certain respects. yes, i know he is a sensitive club-footed, introverted intellectual. but davis is such a venomous witch that nobody that cultured would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it believable. davis is astounding in her role: yes, she may go overboard in her histrionics now and then, but it's a vividly creative portrayal any which way you look at it. too bad she wasn't playing a gangster's moll. her character would have been completely believable as a tramp among low-lifes!
