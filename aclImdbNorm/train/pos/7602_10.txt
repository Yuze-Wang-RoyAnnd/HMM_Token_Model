the 1st season was amazing, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (and seen) was just phenomenal; filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers, and an amazing plot. i mean, i love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. and then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. from then on, i was hooked the second season was right on par with the 1st season, only a little better. i absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the dharma initiative. the whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious, creepy, and exciting. i loved all the suspense surround others on the island, but the dharma story really made season 2 amazing.<br /><br />season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but nonetheless, great. i loved seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. ("tricia tanak is dead" is one of my favorite episodes). this season, while not as good, was still breathtaking and fun, but most of all exciting! now, the 4th season. i had hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes we're good, but then it really started to get boring and monotonous. i mean, i really despise the new "rescuers" such as miles and daniel. the plot got old after the first couple episodes ... and most of all .... season 4 was stripped away of something which made lost a perfect series: the mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (charlie gone) and overall excitement. also, some of my favorite characters have left.
