if you fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a classic fairy tale underneath. christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role. his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots. the other actors are well for their parts. i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward. the king in particular appears a real dunce though, and i wonder if he is supposed to be. i can not remember the original tale. the special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today. overall, i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart.
