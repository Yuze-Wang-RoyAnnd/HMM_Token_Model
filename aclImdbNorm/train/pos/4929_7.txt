i can't really condemn the movie because it does work. there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie, but i think it's only just in the category.<br /><br />there's nothing sinister in this piece, and that's where the noir elements fail. sure, the disease might be considered sinister, but i have a hard time seeing that. the movie hints at a darker side: blackie may be trafficking human beings, the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter, the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie... but those are really only hints.<br /><br />there's no attempt made to question reed's motivations, as one with do with marlowe or spade, nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie, which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out.<br /><br />that lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end.<br /><br />the story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and direction are well done... but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over. worth watching once, maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago, and then putting away.
