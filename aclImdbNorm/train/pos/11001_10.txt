canadian director vincenzo natali took the art-house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube, which is my personal favourite sf film of the 90s. it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube, shot entirely on one set, and took this idea in fascinating directions. <br /><br />i've been eagerly awaiting natali's follow-up, and although its taken five years for him to mount another project, i'm delighted to say it was worth the wait. cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world, and how through a completely logical chain of events, finds himself in a situation beyond his control.<br /><br />i don't want to reveal too much about the plot, because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down. it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it's head. cypher is such a film.<br /><br />morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet, is hired by the company digicorp. they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars. to his bewilderment, they are unbelievably boring. covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese.<br /><br />while morgan is waiting for one seminar, he runs into rita foster (an impeccably cast lucy liu), the definition of an ice maiden. she gives him the brush-off, but there is something to her he finds irresistible. that's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in. <br /><br />when rita turns up at another one of morgan's seminars, she tells him his life is not what it appears. and i'm not saying anything more about the plot. to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us, as well as the tortuous path that's so much fun to follow.<br /><br />as with cube, natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of the familiar, and basically seeing what will happen when they're thrust into the unknown. and cypher follows similar patterns. but it's not a carbon copy of cube. it has it's own inspiration.<br /><br />cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories. one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge. when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle, it's as much of a shock to us as it is to him.<br /><br />one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is. where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns, cypher is also on a low budget, but natali economises it as much as he can, allowing him to broaden the horizon, and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity.<br /><br />natali's direction is exceptional, with a deft hand on the reins. there are some amazing camera angles from above, such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast, robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside. all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture, which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film-noir.<br /><br />the acting is uniformly excellent throughout. jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity. his performance is excellent because it's so modulated. he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes. from a clinical, spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity.<br /><br />david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube. he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black. his scene is one of the best because it's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia. he is a supposed expert in identifying double-agents, and it's a fantastic piece of writing, brilliantly acted by hewlett. all he has to do is look at morgan, and we're drawn into his complex mind game.<br /><br />but it's lucy liu who's the scene stealer here. too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect. but in cypher, she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove. rita is an aloof, guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish. i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control, and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone.<br /><br />things come to a very gratifying end, that doesn't conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did. but morgan deserves his happy ending. after he's been put through the ringer like this, i cheered for him in the final scene. it's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes.<br /><br />cypher succeeds on all counts. engaging, shocking, always entertaining, it's everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn't. and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix.<br /><br />a fine follow-up from natali. and now i'm a committed fan of the man. superb stuff!
