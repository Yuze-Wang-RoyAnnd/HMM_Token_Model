just re-saw this movie after thirty seven years. i was eleven years old and caught this flick on south beach at the long gone cinema theater on washington avenue. in 1969, i thought where it's at! was a very good movie. now, however, after almost forty years, it's not as good as it was. times have changed, and this movie is now a tired old re-hash of the war between the generations. it did however, catch a place in time which is just a memory. it's really interesting to see the mod fashions, the old vegas, a slim don rickles, chain smoking, and a hip opening song. the acting was decent, the script somewhat out-dated, but the memories were still fresh. where it's at, may not be where it's at for you, but for me, it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane.
