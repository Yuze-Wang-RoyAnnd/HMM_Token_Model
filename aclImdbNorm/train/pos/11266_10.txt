i recently watched this, but when it started i had no idea what the concept was about, what the topic was.....in short - i had no idea what it was. was it a documentary, was it a comedy routine.....well, it was both.<br /><br />it started a little slow, but i think that's because i had absolutely no idea what type of program i was viewing. but it quickly sucked me in. the episode i watched had robert wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history. mainly how we (american's) learn history that isn't really true - and how we got to learn what we did. he did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained, and interested. i actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be.<br /><br />i would love to see this picked up as a series for hbo. i believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are "taught" in the same type of manner as this episode.
