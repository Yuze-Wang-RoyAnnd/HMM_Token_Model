i just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if i am repeating something that has already been posted, but i feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin' genius of damon runyon. without the wonderfully street, hilarious writings of damon runyon this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960. damon runyon worked as a newspaper man, and he was from colorado, but he sure did _get_ the street scene of the east coast. if you are not a dedicated fan of old hollywood comedies, i would recommend a few other flicks from damon runyon's writings; "the lemondrop kid," and "little miss marker," both feature bob hope, who, aside from his politics, has always been a funny man. (as a west coast liberal, i find his politics fairly funny, too!) damon runyon lives!!!!
