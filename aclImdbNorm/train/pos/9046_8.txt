i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, i've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. like clive owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. i feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, he'll crack an oscar one day...<br /><br />that's not to denigrate this film at all.<br /><br />it's a fine story, with very believable people (well, it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry), a great cast
