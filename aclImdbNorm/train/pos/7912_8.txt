these things have been floating around in my head for damn near 10 years now. some pieces of this work were really memorable. - id love to see another more current example of cg showy offy stuff. actually i'd love to be part of it.<br /><br />if i'd would of had the chance to just say what i wanted and thats it, i wouldn't have to write all this extra in order to make "10 lines if text" as this website requires. i mean really? this almost discourages me, i mean luckily for the guys that made the movie i really liked the minds eye - and it took me 3 times to have enough lines, i hope you don't get me on the misspelling. - yup you did.
