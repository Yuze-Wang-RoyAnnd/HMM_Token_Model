a good film with--for its time--an intense, sprawling, rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john ford's "the searchers" though not so brutal. the story starts fast and doesn't let up, with several scenes of really good dialog between (stewart's) jeff webster, ronda castle and sheriff gannon. this film is in some ways reminiscent of "bend of the river" (1952), also a mann-stewart work, but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting. there are a few caveats: a too-quickly wrapped up (and rather sentimental) ending; 24-year-old corrine calvert is not very convincing as a naive french teenager, and of course the film takes place in the mythic west, a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics don't apply. but these are trivial concerns. james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself, and the mountain scenery can't be beat. a fine western costume drama.
