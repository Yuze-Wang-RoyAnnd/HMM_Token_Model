six degrees is a wonderful show! i watched the entire season online since i just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season 2 :'( and to top it all off, abc has now taken it off-line, so it is unable to be viewed online anymore. why would abc create such a wonderful show, with a great story line and with great characters just to pull it off the air without ever completing the tale. it seems it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to all of our connected characters. honestly though i feel that abc could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoied it while they continue to air overrated reality tv shows. six degrees we will miss you.
