i've never been huge on imax films. they're cool, but once you get over that initial rush of "whoa, it feels like flying!" the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary. <br /><br />the exceptions have been the powerful "everest", the exhilarating "wild california" and now the bbc's "the human body", a super-sized look at the insides of our bodies. <br /><br />our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable. this 50 minute film could be 10 hours long, and still wouldn't get to all of the systems working in tandem just as i type this review and listen to my radio, and most of us take it all for granted. <br /><br />here you can see the inside of a pumping heart (looks like an alien spaceship), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound, the development of a baby inside a mother's womb, and surprisingly, a few of the...um, less attractive functions that i thought it would shy away from (pimples, the churning of acids in the stomach...)<br /><br />this film also has a rather funky style to it, which sets it apart from other imax documentaries. for instance, we've all seen sperm finding its way to the egg, but have you ever seen it set to the tune of marvin gaye's "let's get it on"? it's creative moments like that that make "the human body" not just a health lesson, but fun as well.
