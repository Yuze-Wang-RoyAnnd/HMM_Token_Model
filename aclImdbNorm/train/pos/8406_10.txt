in 1979, i was a boy of 12 years old, my parents had just got the home box office which was pretty new to our neighborhood. as a 12 year old boy, this was the first time i saw boobs on television. i will never forget the joy of those times. racing vans, the total ass-wipe with the baddest van, the water bed, the smoking of herbs, the hot 70's chicks, the 'makin love in my chevy van song, it was all so new to me. a complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for. i own it and enjoy it about once a year. when i watch this movie, it makes me want to get my skates, with 4 wheels, not in a strait line, go to the park and hunt down some babes with feathered hair. truly great memories of young adolescence!
