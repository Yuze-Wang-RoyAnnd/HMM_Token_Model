most people who have seen this movie thinks that it is the best movie ever made. i disagree but this movie is very very good. tony is a bad ass guy and knows that he's intimidating and uses it to get ahead. it's about him and how he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and a office with cocaine all over the desk. if you want a family movie then this isn't the way to go but if you want mobsters and vengeance and stuff like that then you'll like it.
