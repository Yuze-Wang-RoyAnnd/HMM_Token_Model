as with a bunch of guys at school we must give this a thumbs up. even the grim ripper made us smile. those two alien things made me laugh, bill and ted were the stupidest yet the funnest in the entire movie. this is a lot better than the first one. and yet for some reason i feel that it misses something. something big. something important. made a better house and girlfriends. no, i'd say better villains. use clones instead of robots.i gave this a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic doinks.<br /><br />the grim ripper, don't be scared he's not the deathy kind, is funny. when he fell from the sky i split a gut. splat, i'm not sure about those aliens. what where they? scientists? no way.
