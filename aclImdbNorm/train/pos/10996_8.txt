who can watch a movie, look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed. that woman is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress. that's a tough combination to find now a days. and jeremy northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really noticed him. my advice to hollywood is : "use him more".<br /><br />now about the movie: i watched it in one of my graveyard shift. i don't recommend that to anyone. it's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that. i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming. i'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie. although saying this is spoilment enough.<br /><br />now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie. i love the dark mystic story, the actors did a good job & i love the directors (natali) work in the past. there's not a big audience for this kind of thing, that's also pretty risky. you know what, i'm just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this. then again, 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement.
