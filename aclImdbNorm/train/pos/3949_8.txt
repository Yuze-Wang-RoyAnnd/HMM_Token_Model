like many people on this site, i saw this movie only once, when it was first televised in 1971. certain scenes linger in my memory and an overall feeling of disquiet is how i remember being affected by it. i would be fascinated to see it again, if it was ever made available for home video.<br /><br />possible spoiler: i wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setup and characters might have been derived from a 1960 british movie, originally titled city of the dead, retitled horror hotel for the american release? there are some similarities also to a later british film the wicker man.<br /><br />one detail remains with me years after seeing the film. it's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film. as i recall, a minister and his wife have stopped to aid some people by the side of the road, circa 1870, somewhere out west. the friendly seeming ray milland introduces himself and his ( daughter?), yvette mimieux, a beautiful young mute woman. while the preacher is helping ray milland with the wagon, a rattlesnake slithers into view and coils menacingly, unobserved by any of the characters except yvette mimieux. she doesn't look scared at all, but stares at the snake with silent concentration, until it goes away. with this strange little moment, we already realize there's something highly unusual about these seemingly normal folks, though the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time.<br /><br />that one little scene stays with me vividly after all these years, along with many others. the film has a haunting quality about it that won't let go, and it's not surprising that people remember it so vividly. someone ought to make this available for home video!
