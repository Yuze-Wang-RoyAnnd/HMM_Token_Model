in the colonies we're not all that familiar with arthur askey, so i nearly skipped this film (which had its tcm preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in "ghost train" -- which i expected to be thoroughly annoying. instead i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. the physical aspects of askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if charlie chaplin and woody allen had a baby. there is no comparing him to bud abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. one can feel, moreover, the thread connecting askey to british comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an american point of view that he has more in common with the monty python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. as for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the ending, but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance.
