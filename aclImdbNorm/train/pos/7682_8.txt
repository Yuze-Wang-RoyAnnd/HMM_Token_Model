holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world (some 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation--a tall order that the team at priority films does with great success. american actor ron livington stars in the film alongside newcomer thuy nguyen, a vietnamese actress who plays holly, and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in cambodia. although it tackles a heavy topic, the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close, keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch. i am glad a film like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem. child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step. it's great and a film everyone must see.
