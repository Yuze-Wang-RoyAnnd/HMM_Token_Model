goodnight mister tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised. it isn't completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be? no, not at all. john thaw is mesmerising as tom oakley. his transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised, making it more believable than scrooge in christmas carol. after inspector morse, this is thaw's finest hour. he was matched earnestly by a young nick robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with his mother. the script and music made it worth the buy, and you also see thaw playing the organ. amazing! the most moving scene, was willie finding out about zak's death, and then tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina. buy this, you'll love it! 10/10 bethany cox
