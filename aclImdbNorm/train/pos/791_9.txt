having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on rialto channel i found it to be a pleasant, poignant and enriching film. <br /><br />the casting was excellent. i loved all the characters, they were a little exaggerated in places, (but this is a film). the way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly, as real life can and does. yes, i thought andy macdowell was great. i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities (i find this quite wierd because she's always a solid actress in my opinion).<br /><br />i loved the bit at the end where andy's character said "sometimes i feel he was never here" etc., it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that (which i can personally identify with), then there was that gorgeous classical piece "nocturne" i think by chopin, which was a beautiful way to end (bar the light comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary).<br /><br />i say "well done" to the film makers - i have seen 1,000s of worse films!
