'cry freedom' is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth.<br /><br />the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods (played fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein). while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on biko's death.<br /><br />although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods'. i found the second half about don woods struggle to have biko's story be heard around the world much more interesting.
