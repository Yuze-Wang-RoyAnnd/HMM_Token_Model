to all the haters out there: condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages. that being said, i was a huge fan of bsg, thought it was some of the best tv drama (not just sci-fi) on the air. but it was time for it to end and the story to move on. i liked the bsg epilogue "the plan", but it raised as many new questions as it answered, so i eagerly anticipated "caprica" and i was not disappointed.<br /><br />i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg, and i was pleased that "caprica" is something different, and i personally found the story exciting, in a different way than blazing space battles, explosions and sci-fi special effects (don't get me wrong, i like that stuff too). eric stolz and esai morales give solid performances, and alessandra was just wonderful. i can't wait until next week.
