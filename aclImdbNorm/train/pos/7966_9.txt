as a kid i thought this movie was great. it had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favorite actor: michael j. fox. now, i still love this movie, for different reasons. it has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. it has beautiful, well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly, with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme, that still makes me cry. even when people hum it. and it has my favorite actor, michael j. fox. <br /><br />based on a book, this is the story of three house pets, an intelligent, overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, chance. the three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. dismayed and worried, the pets break out and plan a trip across the sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. a truly incredible journey. so what, maybe home is just over that mountain. but what if it isn't? <br /><br />i suggest homeward bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters, and for anyone else that ... yeah, everyone go watch it.
