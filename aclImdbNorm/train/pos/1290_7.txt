yeah, i remember this one! many years since i actually watched it. the story was entirely surreal, but nonetheless great! what anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at. it's the same with "first kid", which follows a similar pattern. certain movies - like this one here - just aim at plain and comical nonsense. such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. of course these movies lack quality, lack a sophisticated storyline, very often lack first-class acting, but if they do fulfil their primary premise - that's okay. i don't have this movie here on my list of all-time favorites, but i still thought it was funny, had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story. brian bonsall is a smart actor anyway.
