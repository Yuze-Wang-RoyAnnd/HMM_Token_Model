i sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope. i didn't think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter. but it absolutely did, and then some. first, i must say that jared harris did an extraordinary job as john lennon. at times it seemed that harris was channeling lennon. the resemblance was often uncanny, and he clearly studied lennon's mannerisms and vocal inflections. aiden quinn was quite good as mccartney, also bearing a striking resemblance to macca, although he did occasionally trip over his scouse accent.<br /><br />this work of fiction was well-written and well-directed. it was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes i felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion. the rooftop scene was especially moving, as mccartney told lennon what he had never heard as a child--that he was worthy and important, and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents. i also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them danced with absolute abandon to the reggae band!<br /><br />my one complaint would be this: i am not so sure that john was as caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life. he had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely, and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans. only a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murdered.<br /><br />mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had john lived a bit longer. i am quite sure the beatles would have come back together at some stage. and i am quite certain that lennon and mccartney would still be friends today.<br /><br />well done, vh1. i will watch it again and again.<br /><br />
