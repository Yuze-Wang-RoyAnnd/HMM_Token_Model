i must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time, and i was not disappointed. the acting of dominic monaghan is simply fantastic. as a part insomniac myself, i can relate with how the story develops. i have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary. it was a great film, worth every penny. i hope that one day i can work with tess myself, it would be an honor and beyond. i can recommend it for everybody. maybe not small children as they may get scared. but if you are an insomniac like me, you'll understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. you'll love it. <br /><br />f.
