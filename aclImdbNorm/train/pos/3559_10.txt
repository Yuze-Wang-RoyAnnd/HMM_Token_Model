i love this movie. my only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed.<br /><br />it's true that frank sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another frank sinatra movie where it's mostly him doing the singing.<br /><br />i actually thought it was better to use marlon brando's own voice as he has the voice that fits and i could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice.<br /><br />stubby kaye's "sit down, you're rockin' the boat" is a foot-tappin', sing-a-long that i just love. he is a hard act to follow with his version and i still like his the best.<br /><br />vivian blaine is just excellent in this part and "adelaide's lament" is my favorite of her songs.<br /><br />i really thought jean simmons was perfect for this part. maybe i would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part, it made sense.<br /><br />michael kidd's choreography is timeless. if it were being re staged in the year 2008, i would not change a thing.<br /><br />i find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage, even though it was on film.<br /><br />i thought the movie was well cast. i performed in regional versions of this and it's one of my favorites of that period.
