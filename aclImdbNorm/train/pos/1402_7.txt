contains spoilers<br /><br />"hollow man" is probably the weakest movie that paul verhoeven, director of great movies like "total recall", "starship troopers" and "robocop" has ever made. <br /><br />that's probably not his fault. for some reason, verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script, and he made the best of it. <br /><br />the first part of this movie is rather good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even skunk anansie on the soundtrack. unfortunately, the movie falls flat in the second part, were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad "alien" clone. the ending is especially ridiculous <spoiler>, as kevin bacon keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) have killed him. </spoiler>. and the entire thing is quite shallow, indeed: the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated.<br /><br />but all in all, verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie. <br /><br />**1/2 out of **** stars
