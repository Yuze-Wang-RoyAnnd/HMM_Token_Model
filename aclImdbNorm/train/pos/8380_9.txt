now i've always been a fan of full moon's puppet work. but i have to say that robot jox is one of there better projects. yes, you heard me. the story works wonderful, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job. gary graham who really makes his mark on tv in shows like alien nation the series and star trek enterprise shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name. the stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better. the color was wrong, they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be. but that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the robot jox, if you like gary graham or other full moon movies, then you will like this movie. 9 stars out of 10.
