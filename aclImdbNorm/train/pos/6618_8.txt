picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper-stylized black and white visuals of frank miller's sin city. then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as steven spielberg's minority report or richard linklater's a scanner darkly. an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckman's bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut. but although volckman's work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them, such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance, volckman's end result, justice - the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that.<br /><br />genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair, especially in a contemporary context, with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted. as such, renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least, with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo-noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci-fi drama, which serve to compliment each other's storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion. the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one (although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation - the film's title also becomes far more poignant) managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through. though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers, the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes, making for a truly compelling work.<br /><br />volckman's film truly excels in its visual component, and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film's highlight - superbly moody and stylish, it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have. with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot, and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene, the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic, but with a twist, the end result being consistently visually sumptuous. <br /><br />the film's english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting. the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim, stoic policeman karas, and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister's disappearance he is investigating. despite a wavering english accent, romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question, and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega-corporation avalon. ian holm's reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist, and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes.<br /><br />all together, renaissance boasts a visually stunning, unique and compelling futuristic thriller, just as intelligent as it is entertaining. though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be, the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms. for fans of either of the film's intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller, or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted, slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller, the film is without question worth a watch.<br /><br />-8/10
