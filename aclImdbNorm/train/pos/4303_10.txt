this is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting. i never tire of watching it. i especially love the scene where danny glover's character and kevin kline's character namely simon and mack have brunch together. kevin kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often. so its a very 'real' movie. <br /><br />one of the most powerful scenes in the movie however, is at the beginning of the movie when simon arrives at the scene where mack's car has broken down. the movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there's one person preaching his guts out to an audience. instead the actors' emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does best without the use of words. and lastly, mary mcdonell is brilliant as always.
