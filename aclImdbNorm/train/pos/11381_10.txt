the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end, where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters. kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris, so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy, gershwin tunes, and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant. kelly was at his best here - it's a little different to singin' in the rain, and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor. no wonder the sequence ended 'that's entertainment' after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by!
