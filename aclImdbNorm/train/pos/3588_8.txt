when i saw this movie, i was amazed that it was only a tv movie. i think this movie should have been in theaters. i have seen many movies that are about rape, but this one stands out. this movie has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in movies today, let alone tv movies. it tells a story that i'm sure is very realistic to many rape victims in small towns today, and i found it to be very believable(which is something hard to find in other rape centered movies). i also thought that tiffani theissen and brian austin green were awesome in the parts that they played. i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a harsh reality to them. i enjoyed it very much.
