this, "prodigal son" and "eastern condors" are my favourite sammo hung films. the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in "condors", but he's no less sure-footed as director or actor. he is, in fact, at the top of his form and delivers a devastating, brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story also. love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action, and insure that viewers don't hit the fast-forward button between the physical clashes.<br /><br />the opening scene, which features a funny light sabre duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone. a sequence in which sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone. the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, superb direction, and easily one of the best ever of its type. the film's violence escalates slowly until, finally, when the climactic showdown comes, we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production. the director/actor's assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry, menacing opponents is a bone-cracking, physically punishing delight.<br /><br />terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made.<br /><br />great score, too.
