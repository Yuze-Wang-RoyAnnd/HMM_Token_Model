presenting lily mars (mgm, 1943) is a cute film, but in my opinion it could have been better. judy garland is great as always, but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van heflin develops all too quickly.<br /><br />i mean, one minute he's ready to beat her butt, but the next minute he falls in love with her. i believe that this production, the film editing, and the script ( even though the photography was great, the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well) could have been a little better. it feels as though the production was too rushed. <br /><br />the supporting cast was good as well, especially little janet chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter rosie. she at the age of 11, looks really cute and it's a shame that she didn't develop into a teenage comic actress. she's much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late 1930's (except for broadway musketeers 1938, she's really good in that), when they tried to make her into a shirley temple/sybil jason hybrid. overall, this film could better, but in the end, judy gave it her all.
