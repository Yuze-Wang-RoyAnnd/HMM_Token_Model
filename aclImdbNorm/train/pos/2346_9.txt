very sweet pilot. the show reeks of tim burton's better films...edward sissorhands, big fish, charlie & the chocolate factory. the cinematography, the narration, the music, the external sets all scream tim burton. there has to be a connection, or a strong influence, i just haven't researched enough to know where it is.<br /><br />as i've seen in the forums, yes anna friel is playing a poor man's zooey deschanel. every time i see her on the screen i see zooey. don't get me wrong, anna friel does a great job. her character is very sweet and lovable and you easily get attached to her. it's more of a distraction that i keep thinking "why didn't they get zooey deschanel".<br /><br />lee pace does a great job too. i kept trying to remember where i knew him from and just looked it up. wonderfalls!!! great, short lived series from 2004. if you enjoy pushing daisies you must go rent wonderfalls, which is another brian fuller creation
