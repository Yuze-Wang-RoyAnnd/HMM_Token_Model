okay, so i have come a long way from houston by now, but whenever i see this movie, i am taken back to a little cowgirl's dream to one day ride the bull at gilley's. (it burned down before i was of drinking age.)<br /><br />if you grew up in in east texas, then you know this movie is an accurate depiction of contemporary life at that time. if you didn't then trust me and watch the movie. either you will join the many who love it (and at the same time strangely repulsed), or at the very least, you can make fun of the red-necks. (there is plenty material for poking fun.) this movie doesn't try to be p.c. (what was that in the 80's) or hide the white trash element and it is honest to the time and place.<br /><br />gotta be a 10 for me!
