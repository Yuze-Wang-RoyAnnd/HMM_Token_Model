(warning: minor spoilers)<br /><br />i ran into this one partway through and watched from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was. it certainly held my attention; i didn't know until the ending that it was based on a true story! the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl; i have to question how true to life that portrayal is. anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can't be entirely nice. still, i did have some sympathy for him, as he had been set up and taken advantage of; that much was made clear.<br /><br />my main complaint is with the ending (here comes the biggest spoiler! skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn it). a few minutes before it ended, there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered. the way it got discovered was in a "sting" operation, but my question is: how did the police get convinced to go along with it? the movie didn't show us that, and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it.<br /><br />i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes, as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn't have been there (we would already have known what the scene was about, and what was going on with brad in it).<br /><br />otherwise, this is a pretty good film; i give it 7/10. it made me think. now i'm interested to find out the facts of the real case.<br /><br />one more thing: the movie was done in 1996. some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie.<br /><br />p.s. meadow sisto is lovely. i hadn't seen her before. she can act a little, too (always a plus in her line of work, lol).
