wwe was in need of a saviour as wrestlemania 14 rolled around. the departure of bret hart and subsequent evaporation of the hart foundation had left the vile d-generation x stable unchallenged in the wwe. their despicable leader shawn michaels had stolen the title from hart thanks to the interference of vince mcmahon and, with help from his cohorts triple h and chyna had systematically taken out anyone who challenged his supremacy. but at the royal rumble a new contender had emerged. stone cold steve austin. hated by mcmahonagement, austin had dx worried. so worried in fact that they'd enlisted the help of "the baddest man on the planet" mike tyson as a special enforcer. austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with shawn michaels.<br /><br />but first, there was an undercard to get through which kicked off with the legion of doom winning a forgettable 15 team battle royal to become no.1 contenders for the tag titles. i'd actually forgotten this match existed until i rewatched the ppv. no very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in time.<br /><br />next match saw the light heavyweight title defended by champion taka michonoku against aguila. the wwe had established the light heavyweight title to compete with the strong cruiserweight division in wcw. it was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever defended at wrestlemania. short match, going about five minutes, and in fact too short for much to be achieved. what little they did was exciting and this was a nice little match which saw taka retaining his title.<br /><br />ok, our next match saw dx member triple h defending the wwe european title, which he'd won in farcical fashion from shawn michaels on raw in december and hadn't defended on ppv, against owen hart, the sole survivor. triple h got a big entrance with the dx band there to perform his theme song. chyna accompanied triple h to ringside, but was then handcuffed to wwe commissioner sgt slaughter. triple h and owen have a nice little match, before chyna interfered causing a low blow on hart which leads to triple h retaining the title. good match, could have been great had it gone slightly longer.<br /><br />but of course we wouldn't want to take time away from our next match which saw real life husband and wife marc mero and sable defeat goldust and luna vachon in the first mixed tag match at wrestlemania in 8 years. and, in all honesty, it wasn't worth the wait. while not terrible, the match was in no way memorable either. this was the nearing the end of mero's only run in the wwe and the main purpose was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with sable.<br /><br />next up we saw ken shamrock flip out and cost himself the intercontinental championship as he destroyed ic champion the rock, but then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold, resulting in the referee reversing his decision. this was a short match, but decent for what it was.<br /><br />next saw the first good match of the night as wwe tag team champions the new age outlaws lost their titles to cactus jack and chainsaw charlie in a fun dumpster match. the decision was overturned the following night as cactus and chainsaw had thrown the outlaws into a dumpster backstage, rather than the one being used in the match, but this was still a fun match.<br /><br />now it was time for the highly anticipated first ever meeting between kane and his brother the undertaker. kane had cost undertaker the wwe championship at the royal rumble and then "killed" him when he helped shawn michaels lock undertaker in a casket and set him on fire as revenge for the undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly disfigured years before. this was a decent match and told a nice story as the underataker absorbed everything kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three tombstones to end the match.<br /><br />this left only the main event which saw wwe champion face steve austin with mike tyson as the guest enforcer. michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the undertaker at the royal rumble and was remarkable in this match despite his physical limitations. triple h and chyna were banished to the back in the early going after interfering from the outside. the match ended with austin ducking an attempt at sweet chin music and hitting the stone cold stunner with the ref down. tyson then came into the ring to count the three, celebrating the win with austin and then knocking out michaels after the match. it turned out tyson and austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all along.<br /><br />that was the final ppv match for shawn michaels for four and a half years. it helped establish austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity garnered by tyson's appearance proved a crucial turning point in the wwe's battle with wcw. austin would go on to become the biggest star in wwe history, and along with the rock, mick foley, the undertaker and triple h lead the wwe through the period where they would gain their highest level of cultural relevance. and it all started here at wrestlemania 14.
