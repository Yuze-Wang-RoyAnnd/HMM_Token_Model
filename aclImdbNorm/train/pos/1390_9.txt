if you love cult 70's sci-fi the way i do, or if you like movies such as "repo man" or "buckaroo bonzai" than you're going to love this one. it's a stream of consciousness 70's sci-fi spectacular, including a 22nd century junkyard and the earth a million years from now. this movie is pure 70's. put on steve miller's "fly like an eagle" or pink floyd's "dark side of the moon" and you're ready to go!
