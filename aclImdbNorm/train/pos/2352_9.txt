i have to say, when "pushing daisies" came out i was immediately won out by the fairy-tale like setting of such grimness. the narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal by making death seem as routine as, well, ned (lee pace) baking pies. and that bringing them back to life was just as routine.<br /><br />the trio of ned, emerson cod (chi mcbride) and charlotte "chuck" charles (anna friel), plus sometimes-sidekick olive snook (kristin chenoweth, who made the musical wicked such a delight) made for some fantastic dialogue and silliness. it definitely deserves the title of a (romantic) comedy/drama.<br /><br />ned and chuck made for a shy and not-quite-ready-for-love couple who are still exploring their feelings even though they cannot touch - an obstacle that seems to be truly no obstacle with aids such as gloves, cellophane, and quirky schedules around the apartment. but despite the awkwardness presented as they work their feelings around a strange secret which only a few know, they still manage to show their on screen chemistry in touching scenes like when ned gives chuck the beehives. the presence of olive, though, makes for some break-out-in-song moments in the pie shop and unforeseen complications for the couple.<br /><br />second season sharply declined, putting a damper on a show that had real potential. on some of the episodes, the plot line was rushed and awkward, making you ask "what just happened?" in both the overall dead-person-of-the-week plot and in the overriding plot line. the addition of chuck's father plus two half-brothers for ned didn't help, and at least one of the plot lines felt almost recycled (didn't the episode "comfort food" feel like the episode "bitter sweets" in the fact that the dead-person-of-the-week died in food?). a few touching moments (the beehives) happened to help advance the relationship between chuck and ned, but every time they got close, the writers decided to throw in another monkey wrench rather than let the relation develop (oliver comes back from the monastery, chuck's dead father comes back to life and doesn't go back, you get the picture).<br /><br />shame it didn't work out, but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way, just enough pleasantvillesque color/happy-smiley going on and implausible scenarios to remind you that it's not "dead like me." then again, it's in "pushing daisies time," according to creator bryan fuller, so it makes it plausible again.<br /><br />it should have lasted longer, but it's merely wistful thinking at this point. kudos to whatever new show attempts to replace this short-lived gem.
