** warning - contains spoilers! **<br /><br />first of all, i would like to say that i really liked this game. i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents. i am glad that i did that.<br /><br />first off, i would like to say that the single player was very good. the first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you are at a party in london, and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter. of course you have to rescue her, and it is quite a big level, but should probably take you at least five minutes. the best part, and i think also the funniest part, is when you are in the jet-pack, and people are rappelling down big ben. just equip the jet-pack's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down. pure fun!<br /><br />the rest of the levels are very good, but pretty short. there are four mini-levels you can unlock, and that is one of the let downs, because only the first two of them are actually fun, and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' objectives, i mean, c'mon! we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad!<br /><br />the multi player, me and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenging, even if there are no bots. halo didn't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games! you can be a load of bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character.<br /><br />gameplay - 8.5/10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved). graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd bad graphic, but that isn't extremely often). multiplayer - 10/10 (needs no comment, just great, you get to drive in jet-packs and vehicles). sound - 8/10 replay value - 7/10 (the only levels i go back on are the loondon level and istanbul part 1).<br /><br />i give this game: 8.5/10<br /><br />could have a bit of improvement, but it's still good.
