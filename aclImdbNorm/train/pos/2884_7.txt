out of all the princess stories disney has put out there, cinderella probably has the most enduring appeal. i can't really say why, but for some reason, generation after generation thrusts her to the top of their lists. as a little girl, i wanted nothing more than to be cinderella with her glass slipper- it was my absolute favorite costume.<br /><br />honestly, i don't think there is any story that more realizes the longings of the human heart than cinderella. who has never wanted to run away from the drudgeries of daily life and find someone who sees you as no one else ever had? the story is older than the english language and somehow it still rings true.<br /><br />as for the characters, if nothing else, disney can make a wonderful villain. lady tremaine is evil to the t, in a wonderfully calculating, not overtly physical way. her cutting tongue and eyes do the work for her- she doesn't need staffs of lightening to strike fear into your heart. the animal friends tend to grate, especially that idiotic gus. i would have cheered had he met his fate in lucifer's jaws. cinderella herself was no pushover- making some justly catty remarks at times. however, she just lacked the drive to make her entirely sympathetic. sure, she was nice and fed animals, but what was keeping her at that place? we never know. even if she only became a maid in another house, at least she's be getting paid and have a shot at respect. it seems the only reason things work out in the end for cindy is that everything sort of falls to place in her lap. she never works for her dreams that she sings so fondly of.<br /><br />which brings me to the music, which is lovely, as ever. ilene woods has a lovely, rich voice, probably my favorite of any disney heroine. some big standards originated here- a dream is a wish your heart makes, so this is love, bibbidi bobbidi boo...<br /><br />cinderella is a wonderful heartfelt story with a ton of musical highlights. while it is lacking in some character development, it does provide some classic villains and excellent voice work. if you are feeling sick at heart, pop it in- it'll warm you up and make you hum mmm mmm good!<br /><br />quote of the film:<br /><br />-surprise! surprise! -duh duh duh- happy birthday!
