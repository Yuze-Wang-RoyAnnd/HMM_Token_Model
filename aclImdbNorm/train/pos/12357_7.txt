i really liked this movie, and went back to see it two times more within a week.<br /><br />ms. detmers nailed the performance - she was like a hungry cat on the prowl, toying with her prey. she lashes out in rage and lust, taking a "too young" lover, and crashing hundreds of her terrorist fianc'e's mother's pieces of fine china to the floor. <br /><br />the film was full of beautiful touches. the maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the rooftops. i particularly enjoyed the ancient greek class and the recitation of 'antigone'.<br /><br />it had a feeling of 'story of o' - that is, where people of means indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure. as she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff, she is at ease - and why not, what is to restrain a "devil in the flesh"?<br /><br />the whole movie is a real treat!
