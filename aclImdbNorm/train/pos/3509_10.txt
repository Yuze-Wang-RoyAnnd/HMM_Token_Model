i saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list. it is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits (such as the 'cafe bustelo' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair) that people aren't seeing because you will not understand this movie unless you are hispanic. this is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular. please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon. i completely see what the writer/director was going for, and he hit the target perfectly! this film is highly deserving of a better rating.
