one of the best movie-dramas i have ever seen. we do a lot of acting in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work. i highly recommend this one, especially for those who have an interest in acting, as a "must see." there are several scenes of note. for one, the graveyard scene when hamlet encounters yorick (everyone knows about that scene by just going to elementary school), and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done. the logic used in this scene was tremendous--i suppose a testament to shakespeare more than anything else. for a second, i very much enjoyed the scene where hamlet, horatio and the character played by robin williams discussed the upcoming duel.
