bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in "diva las vegas". i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to. she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity. her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you. the highlight of the show was her singing "stay with me" from her 1979 movie "the rose". you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps. the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette midler's albums.
