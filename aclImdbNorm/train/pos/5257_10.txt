i must say, this movie has given me a dual personality. i've been told again and again to shut up and start speaking like a normal person. but, it's very hard... no not the wang. did you find that disgusting and disrespectful? well, get in the mood for a lot more. this movie is just filthy! it's not a film to show your grand-parents, but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your workplace. anyway, back to the voice mannerisms. fortunately this site has some ladies man (did anyone at the studio notice that there's supposed to be a apostrophe(?) between the e and s?) so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops. i have a sheet in my wallet.
