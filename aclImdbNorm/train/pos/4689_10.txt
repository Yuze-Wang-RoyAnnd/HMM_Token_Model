i agree whole-heartedly with the comments so far. i remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative i've ever seen. as stated before, i recall that i began watching, thinking it was just another nature study - interesting, not necessarily special, but i was so wrong. not only was the story of the colony incredible, but i remember the music as being so much a part of it's appeal. if i remember correctly, it was native americn pipes (akin to the music at the end of one flew over the cookoo's nest). i, too have been looking for a copy. this should be required watching for anybody, but especially the schools. it should be re-released.
