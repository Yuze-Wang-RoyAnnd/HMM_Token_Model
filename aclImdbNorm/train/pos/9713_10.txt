this series premiered on the cable tv station "comedy central" in the united states. it was chopped to death, and shown out of sequence. this was sad for the audience it should have attracted, it didn't and fell by the wayside. luckily, at the same time my cable company went digital and i got the bbc. thank goodness because i got to see "the league of gentlemen" in order, complete and uncut. <br /><br />"the league of gentlemen" troupe is right up there with england's "monty python's flying circus" and canada's "the kids in the hall". but..a warning.<br /><br />"the league of gentlemen" though are one step beyond. it's not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills, it goes deeper and much, much, darker. i can tell many of you now -- it will offend certain groups of people, it will enrage others. but remember, its only comedy..dark, dark comedy. if that is not your thing, don't watch. if you think you know dark comedy, watch this -- if you get angry and upset, then you don't quite know dark comedy. <br /><br />these guys got it right, and right on the button. they are brilliant, they are excellent and i enjoyed each and every character creation. there's a complete story that is told here from episode one to the end. you cannot watch this one episode at a time, willy nilly, that is one of the charms of this series. watch it in order. see how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are. no one and nothing is out of bounds. that, my dears, is "dark humor". bravo!
