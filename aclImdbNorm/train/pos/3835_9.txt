this film is amazing - it's just like a nightmare. the bizarre story, the dark decors, the swarming insects everywhere, the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams... really great! people who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. it seems a little to the films of david lynch: the strange story, the bizarre dreams, the red curtains. nuit noire contains almost no plot. it's rather a succession of surrealistic happenings, nightmares and meetings. that's a drawback. if the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement, i would give it a 10 out of 10. but that's missing, and that's why i gave the movie an 8. nuit noire is a film worth watching. search that dvd and you'll be rewarded!
