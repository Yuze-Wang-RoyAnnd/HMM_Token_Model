im really addicted to caprica, because it's a really good prequel series to battlestar galactica. it really has a slow pace start, but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air.<br /><br />i have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season.<br /><br />this sci fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres.<br /><br />eric stoltz does an amazing job, as well as polly walker as clarice willow!!<br /><br />totally worth checking out!!<br /><br />catch caprica on fridays at 9pm/8pm central on syfy
