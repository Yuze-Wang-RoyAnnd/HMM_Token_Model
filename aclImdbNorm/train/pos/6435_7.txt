i think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie don't understand how to watch a movie and/or have little sense of elegance. first, to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together. modern sensibilities demand great drama. no, i don't mean great setting of characters and plots, but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic. this is a subtle movie. its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. it is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness, politics, human weakness, venality...you name it. the world it's set in would be alien and not understood today...a world where if you have it you have to flaunt it now and loudly, even if you only think you have it.<br /><br />many people today don't understand that victorian society wasn't really victorian as people understand that term today.<br /><br />this movie helps set the record straight.
