nifty little episode played mainly for laughs, but with clever dollop of suspense. somehow a martian has snuck aboard a broken-down bus on its way to nowhere, but which passenger is it, (talk about your illegal immigrants!). all-star supporting cast, from wild-eyed jack elam (hamming it up shamelessly), to sexy jean willes (if she's the martian, then i say let's open the borders!), to cruel-faced john hoyt (the most obvious suspect), along with familiar faces john archer and barney phillips (and a nice turn from bill kendis as the bus driver). makes for a very entertaining half-hour even if the action is confined to a single set.
