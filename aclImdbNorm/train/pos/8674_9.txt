tis is a farly typical tom and jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. the characters behave in appropriate ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos. the best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. a word of warning-it is most unwise to allow tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! highly recommended.
