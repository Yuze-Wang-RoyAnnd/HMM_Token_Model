the final season of roseanne was a roller coaster ride of crazy. this final episode does just what a previous comment says, it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not. roseanne reaches back to season one, and tells us that this show has been her rendition of her life. she says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit. scott was not really with leon, but he existed. mark and david married opposite wives in real life, and dan died when she made him live. as events happened in her life, she changed them in her writing. don't we all wish we could do that. don't we all have a moment in time that we wish we could just use an eraser and change to our liking. this is what she did with the entire episode. and to another comment i would say that i don't feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, she just changed the way that events happened in their lives. an a+ ending to an a+ show!!!!
