this was by far the best war documentary ever made. from the very beginning of the first episode when sir laurence olivier described the horrific events in oradour-sur-glane 'the day the soldiers came'. to the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over japan, i never missed a second of this classic series and i remember it well even though it was screened way back in 1974. each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. this whole series should be compulsory viewing for as many of the world's children as possible so that the tragedy of world war two is not repeated and that bigotry, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
