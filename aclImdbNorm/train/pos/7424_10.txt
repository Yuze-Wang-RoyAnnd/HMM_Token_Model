i was 16 when i first saw the movie, and it has always been a huge favorite of mine. of course, you can't deny the appeal of kristofferson in the movie - how fine is that man???????????? sheesh. he still is. he's the bad boy every woman secretly wants. his acting is flawless. he played a drunk/druggie only the way someone who really had gone through it could - and he had - in '76 he finally got on the wagon, so it was all very real.<br /><br />the music is great and even though in later years i thought streisand was somewhat not the right person for him in a physical beauty sense, i think it's more a problem for male viewers than female. us gals are just looking at kris - and naturally the guys are looking at the female interest - my husband cannot watch the movie b/c of her - he doesn't like her looks. but i did make him sit through just the red ferrari scene on the road towards the end just so he could see how well done it was - the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with the music blasting - you should have seen it on my 50" plasma - wow!!!! and lastly, the transfer quality was great - anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great color and very low noise except for dark areas which is normal for all film.<br /><br />brought back some great memories of my mom and i loving this movie together, i bought a copy for her for christmas. would have loved to watch it together with her last night.<br /><br />i have tried to sit through the original with judy garland, but i guess seeing this one first, i just can't get into the earlier era. watching all the concert footage in the '76 version was so much like what i was living at the time.<br /><br />i am working my way through the commentary by streisand, but she seems to only talk about herself and the songs, so far she has barely even mentioned kris or details about scenes in the movie. her voice sounds exactly the same now as then.<br /><br />check it out, if you grew up in the same era as me (born in 1960) you will love it.<br /><br />wendy
