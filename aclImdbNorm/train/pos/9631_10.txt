a laurel & hardy comedy short. the boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of professor noodle, a mad scientist who's just perfected his rejuvenation serum. stan & ollie proceed with their dirty work, spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof. then the professor wants to try out his new potion...<br /><br />a very funny little film. the ending is a bit abrupt, but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific. especially good is stan & ollie's contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney. that's lucien littlefield as the professor.
