it has been so many years since i saw this but i do feel compelled to defend this gem against those who lambast it.<br /><br />it is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinion here. that is what humour does i suppose. it is subjective. it either charges through your funny bone at 60,000 volts or it leaves you cold and wondering why you gave it the time.<br /><br />this show has some of britain's best comic actors put together in a story that is silly and irreverent and the outcome is hilarious. the dialogue and visual comedy is beautifully delivered and the two leads (cleese and lowe) are superb together. this was made for them.<br /><br />i can't really say anymore other than to implore you to find this and watch it. you won't be disappointed and in a world devoid of genteel humour, this is a classic inane and harmless piece of comedic brilliance.
