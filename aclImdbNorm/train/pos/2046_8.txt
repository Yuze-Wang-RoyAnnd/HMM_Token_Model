while the soundtrack is a bit dated, this story is more relevant in the u.s. now more than ever. with not only blue collar jobs but everyone's jobs being outsourced by u.s. corporations while the government profits and american suffer.<br /><br />peter strauss is emory, a steel worker who works the same job his father did for 35 years. his wife is well-portrayed by pamela reed, who is very realistic, trying to support the family with two children when emory loses his job. the mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement, but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steelworker in one month (outsourcing) what they would have to pay strauss/emory in a day. never mind that these men are all good loyal workers who have values and try the best for their family.<br /><br />john goodman, gary cole (as strauss' brother) and a few other co-workers are also affected. it is very disturbing and realistic. some scenes between emory and his father are moving. emory hopes his local union will be able to re-open the mill, as they promise to do so.<br /><br />emory's brother, lee already sees the writing on the wall. there are no jobs left in the rust-belt (ohio) and they must move on. however where in the u.s. can they move to?. where will it be better for a blue-collar steel worker?.<br /><br />there is a triumphant scene at the end where emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products. the guard allows them to do this as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and he has empathy.<br /><br />overall, a good message film about hard times right here in america. something that few care to face until personally affected. 8/10.
