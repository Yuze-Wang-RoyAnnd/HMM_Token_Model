slaughter high starts like any other day at doddsville county high school where little minx carol manning (caroline munro) has tricked resident nerd marty rantzen (simon scuddamore) into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get undressed in the shower, while doing so carol's gang of friends come in & give the now naked marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an april fool's day joke. the school's sports coach (marc smith) saves marty & punishes the gang who rather harshly blame marty, they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand & marty is caught in an explosion & has nitric acid splashed over his face. years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school, they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there. they all venture inside where they quickly learn they aren't the only ones there as marty is back & has revenge on his mind...<br /><br />originally shot under the title april fool's day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named april fool's day (1986) made the same year this american english co-production is unusual in that it has three credited writers & directors, george dugdale, mark ezra & peter litten (after never seeing a film with three credited director's i've now seen two in a week the other being the jean-claude van damme flick kickboxer (1989)) & i have to say i really rather liked slaughter high even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation. one of the things i like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick, it doesn't try to be anything else & it just accepts the genres rules, short comings & trappings & plays up to them. basically it delivers what it promises, a homicidal killer, blood, boobs & babes. i thought the character's were alright, the story was ok even though it's just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can bump them off one at a time & i actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which slaughter high gets a lot of flak for. the first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another. some of the situations & character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who's complaining?<br /><br />despite three credited director's slaughter high turned out pretty good, i liked the look of the film a lot. the isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location & looked good, the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well & there's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots which follow carol through various corridors of the rundown school. while not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough & is professionally made. there is some good gore here including burnt bodies, people melted with acid, impalings, stomach explosions, axes in faces & death by lawnmower as well as someone who gets drowned in fecal matter down a drain! the special effects are also better than one would expect & i was both impressed & pleased with the higher than expected body count.<br /><br />technically the film is better than i had expected & beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today, i would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though. supposedly set in america this was very obviously shot in england. harry manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores & is basically the same as the theme from friday the 13th (1980) & it's sequels. anyone living here in the uk will probably recognise billy hartman who played frank as a regular in emmerdale farm (one of our nations top rated soap operas) in which he plays terry woods! while most horror fans will recognise the sexy caroline munro in a rare staring role. legendary exploitation producer dick randall did the deed on slaughter high & actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer... talk about typecasting! you can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was pieces (1982) which he also produced behind him in his office.<br /><br />slaughter high is a slasher film that i liked a lot, did you see that? i didn't say it was great i actually said i liked it on a personal level & i'm sure the predictable plot & lack of story will probably put many off so i can't recommend it but i can say i liked it, make of that what you want. make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out. if your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then slaughter high won't change your mind but if your looking for a simple & effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this.
