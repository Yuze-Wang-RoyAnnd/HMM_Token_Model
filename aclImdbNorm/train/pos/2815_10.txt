cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews. as if it were a mediocre movie of some run-of-the-mill dudes.<br /><br />the movie is great, funny, crazy, over-the-top violent though with minimum gore, and all the way energetic to the core. loved every single bit of it. can't remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial art showing off. and now the most important thing (at least to me): it is computer effects free. when i watch some hollywood actors duking it out on screen in modern high-resolution and damn high-budgeted action "fuflo" (a russian word that means "bull*beep*"), i understand that any *beep* child can do it - you can adjust the wires to the body, add some cute pc effects, and stuff it into the action film. here it is different. i don't think that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide, who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the end of the film or the "chinese football" play. and it is just a little hong kong cinema made for fun, not pretending to be "star wars".<br /><br />having a dvd with english soundtrack is not a problem with this movie. it does not spoil the atmosphere to me.<br /><br />can't help mentioning a very neat theatrical play. some of you, suppose, won't like it. as to me - it's amazing. have a look at the dragon's friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in his left side of the head. his face expression changes into something whimsical and he comes up to dragon with a baby expression. and take a look at the menacing size of his mouth - it's nearly from one ear to the other long when he makes grimaces.<br /><br />this movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world. very thankful to our russian industry for the releases of classic jackie chan movies. his modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype.<br /><br />total 10 out of 10 - a legendary movie in its genre. thank you for attention.
