this show probably won't appeal to everyone. sarah does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize. this is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. the star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. if you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers, the show probably isn't for you. everyone should at least give this show a chance. it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman, brian posehn (the comedians of comedy), jay johnston (mr. show), steve agee (bobcat goldthwait's 'stay') and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon (heat vision & jack, monster house). it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community, channel101.com. (if you're into this show, keep an eye out for "the department of acceptable media" on vh1 this march, it'll be drawing from the same talent pool.)<br /><br />watch sarah silverman's show. this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment.
