the plot of goodnight mr tom on paper makes it seem we are in for a large dose of maudlin,sickly sentiment.but,talented director jack gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right manner,and it emerges instead as a compelling,deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances.one of the best,if not the best tv movies of the 1990's which possibly would've had even greater success if it had been released in the cinemas.<br /><br />the evacuation of children to countryside towns and villages in world war ii was of course a common practice,but in the case of the young boy here was doubly important because of a wretched home life in the uk's capital.the horrors of war on the home front are not drifted over though,and the construction of the film until it's throat-lumping,misty-eyed ending leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before.it is almost(but not quite)worthy of comparison with the finale to it's a wonderful life(1946).all in all,a modern classic.
