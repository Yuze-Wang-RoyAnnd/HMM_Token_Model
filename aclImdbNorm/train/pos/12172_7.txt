this movie starts out brisk, has some slow moments in the middle, but generally moves along well, has a few very good moments, then peters out at the end of act 3. i was able to get to see this in la premieres 2 times (with 2 different endings). jason lee is a star, but he is not tomorrows leading man. he is humorous and holds his own, but he is better served as a supporting actor. julia stiles does 'ok' in a comedy role, new for her, but she doesn't 'steal' this movie, the way a star of her caliber should. for an actress who has so much potential(10 things, save the last dance, o), it is hard to watch her continue to do roles that are so 'average', and then not have her take the role and run away with the movie (like daniel day-lewis did in 'gangs'). selma blair is a good young actress as well, and does an 'ok' job. i didn't expect an academy award performance from her, and she didn't deliver one, but, her performance was adequate. chris koch delivers another film that is 'above average'. perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else. i 'did' like this movie! but, it is not a movie where you walk away and say...'that was great!'...this 'story' has been done so many times before and there was just not much new here. the rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the movie, and larry miller gives an incredible performance in a supporting role (he could be the best surprise of the film). if you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times, and have an enjoyable evening, i can still recommend this film, but unless they have changed the ending...again...leave during the church scene, or you will surely be disappointed.
