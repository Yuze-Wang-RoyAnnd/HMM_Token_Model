better than the typical made-for-tv movie, invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting (urich, lucci, cassidy, mccarthy, pre-murphy brown joe regalbuto, soleil moon-frye) and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot. urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles. kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live, the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy, maudlin denoument. 7/10
