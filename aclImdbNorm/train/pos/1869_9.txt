antwone fisher's story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children. abandoned by a troubled mother, antwone has never met his father. growing up with "church going" abusers who use the "n-word" not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment, as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold-up, enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the navy, antwone's anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a navy psychiatrist, and a love enters his life.<br /><br />the scene where antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film. stunned by the unexpected confrontation, the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime, addictions to drugs, fathering children left and right, all despite his utterly adverse circumstances.<br /><br />if that scene wasn't powerful enough, the very next one drives it home (and opens the flood gates): a reception to welcome home antwone; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that he is part of this great family.<br /><br />one of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well-meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children. even if some of the homes and administrators don't seem to care and appear self-serving, many do give it their all. the character who found antwone's "file" once he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of those "bright lights" in the darkness of the system.<br /><br />the dvd includes a french language track, various subtitle choices, as well as additional features and information about foster parenting.<br /><br />as a clevelander i appreciated the location footage. no matter where you are from, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem.
