sam kleinman (peter falk) comes to his son's place unexpectedly.his son ben kleinman (paul reiser) is quite surprised to hear that his mother, muriel kleinman (olympia dukakis) has left his father.ben's wife, rachel (elizabeth perkins) and his three sisters try to find muriel while ben and his father go see a farmhouse that's for sale.but that's not the end of their journey.their road trip turns into a long therapy session between ben and his father.raymond de felitta is the director of the thing about my folks (2005).paul reiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a remarkable job.the dialogue between ben and sam is just amazing.and he did work with the script for twenty years so no wonder it's this good.who would be better man to play the father than peter falk? nobody, i can tell you that.and i really love the story on why paul wanted peter falk for the part.peter was an actor who made his own father laugh.and peter certainly made me laugh in this movie.it's just hilarious when they go fishing.and how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick.the movie is often very funny and i found myself laughing several times.but it can also be touching from time to time.you couldn't tell a story any better than it is told here.
