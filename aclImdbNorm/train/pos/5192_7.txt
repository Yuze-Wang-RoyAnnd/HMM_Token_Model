i am a kung fu fan, but not a woo fan. i have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. now, martial arts; *that's* beautiful! and john woo surprised me here by producing a highly entertaining kung fu movie, which almost has *too much* fighting, if such a thing is possible! this is good stuff.<br /><br />many of the fight scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are amusing and likable. the bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less. you gotta see the sleeping wizard!! he can only fight when he's asleep - it's hysterical!<br /><br />upon repeated viewings, however, last hurrah for chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. hence, i rate it "only" a 7 out of 10. but it really is almost an "8".<br /><br />all in all one of the better kung fu movies, made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. all the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies, to be fair).
