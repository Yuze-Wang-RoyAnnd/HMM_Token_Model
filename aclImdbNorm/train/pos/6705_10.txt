and it's not because since her days on "clarissa explains it all" that i've had a bit of a crush on melissa joan hart, who at the time this show was popular was already well into her 20s, but was still able to get teenage roles. "sabrina, the teenage witch" was hart's next big leap after her "clarissa" days. based on the comic strip, sabrina spellman is - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who attempts to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life. she is aided in her endeavors by her two aunts and a wise-cracking black cat as she goes from high school, to college, and finally to her career in journalism.<br /><br />as usual, hart is the show's heart & soul. "sabrina, the teenage witch" is quite moving and very funny, and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was. i only wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy.<br /><br />10/10
