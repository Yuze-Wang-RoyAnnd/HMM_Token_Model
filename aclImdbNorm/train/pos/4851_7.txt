ghost train is a fine and entertaining film, typical of the better british comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s. the antics of comedian arthur askey are not as funny as they once apparently were, but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or a curiosity.<br /><br />for a low-budget wartime production, ghost train is atmospheric, effective, and it provides some genuine suspense. great fun for a dark (and, yes, stormy) night. lighten up, take off the critic's hat, and enjoy.
