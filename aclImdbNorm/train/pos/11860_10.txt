this movie has it all. it is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of cuban refugees. antonio montana(played by al pacino), is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in america. this cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of miamis' drug empire is astonishing. brian depalma does an amazing job directing this picture, so much that, the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline, as well as every character in the cast. with tony's characters' pressence being so believable and strong, brian depalma brang out the raw talent exposed by steven bauer(manny, tony's best friend), mary elizabeth mastantonio(gina, tony's sister), robert loggia(frank, tony's boss)and michelle pfeiffer(elvira, frank's wife). i enjoyed every minute watching this movie, and still watch it on a weekly basis. on this year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime movie, i for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers. with other crime movies being so dramatic i find, this movie is a shock to the system.
