i waited and waited for this film to come out,the trailers seemed to be on for years, it was worth it. i'm not a big fan of watching films over and over again but i cant wait for this to come out for all to buy! not a big fan of jim but this suited him perfectly, there was so much to see and the 'feel good factor' is off the scale, perfect for christmas. i think ron did a fab job turning this into a film, if you haven't seen it then do so, if you have, watch it again, i know you want to!
