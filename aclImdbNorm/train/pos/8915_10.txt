the blob is a great horror movie, not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable, flesh-dissolving title character, but because it features a real societal message. it is, in many ways, a "feel-good horror film." the clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast. the two romantic leads, steve mcqueen and aneta corsaut, bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings. they are misunderstood but very well-meaning young people, and it's very easy to root for them.<br /><br />this is a pro-society movie, and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom, not out of some malevolent character flaw. steve mcqueen's drag-racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings, but quickly joins in mcqueen's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees mcqueen's seriousness. in this way, a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism.<br /><br />the authorities' initial skepticism of the kids' wild claims is proved wrong--and once the threat is acknowledged by all, all conflict within the society disappears. this unification of purpose, and the validation of the "troublemaking" teens, becomes official when aneta corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the blob. on any other day, breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent--on this particular day, it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure. at this turning point, it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old.<br /><br />this is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a "generation gap" but suggests that it is more imaginary than real, and that given a real crisis, people will naturally band together to restore order. "the blob" is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of "night of the living dead" (1968).<br /><br />much has been made of the film's cheap but innovative (and effective!) visual effects. they are undeniably clever. a lot of the gravity-defying tricks we see the blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated. the camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly "locked down" position (the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that). these scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned--the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up. in a way, this was similar to stop motion photography, but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet. even today, the effects are startling and bizarre.<br /><br />a very good film with an exploitative-sounding title, the blob is a must-see.
