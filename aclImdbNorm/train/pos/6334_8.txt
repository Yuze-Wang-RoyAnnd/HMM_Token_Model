this movie has some things that are pretty amazing. first, it is supposed to be based on a true story. that, in itself, is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall-in nebraska. i wonder if the real town's name was close to "blainsworth" (which is the town's name in the movie). there is an ainsworth, nebraska, but there is also a town that starts with blains-something.<br /><br />it does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house. on the other hand, the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact. before doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel (not on cable) and tuned the brightness just right, you could tell if there was a tornado coming. the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it. <br /><br />since i know something about midwest tornadoes, it made this movie fun for me. i enjoy it more than twister. i mean, give me a break-there is no way you could make it through and f5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house.
