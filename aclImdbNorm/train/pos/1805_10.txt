i just saw this film, i first saw it when i was 7 and could just about remember the end. so i watched it like, 10 minutes ago, and (i may seem like a baby as i am 12 ha-ha) i started to cry at the ending, i forgotten how sad it was. i think i was mainly sad for anne-marie because she said: 'i love you charlie' and also: 'i'll miss you charlie', just made me really cry ha-ha. it has to be one of me favourite movies of all time, it is just a film well worth watching. watch it ha-ha, thats all i can say xd<br /><br />but, i love this film, its a true classic.<br /><br />xx maverick xx 10/10
