pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. if the murderer wanted to whack the dame, why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit? involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths you'd have to worry about staying shut. why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word? are there really cops out there who are wise cracking, gum popping, grinning apes who approach a suspect in such a glib manner? this probably played well back before the wheel was invented, but it is so corny and unbelievable today. catch the manic drum break by elisha cook; his frenetic hammering never once matched the recording. his mad facial expressions made up for the off kilter stick sync.
