when i took my seat in the cinema i was in a cool mood and didn't plan on changing it. but this movie is a dramatic powerhouse. i was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward. so what have we? theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage turkish girl living in copenhagen, denmark. it came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from "bend it like beckham", where we had an indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister. here we have it transferred to a turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding by doing kung fu. and we have a love story and a competition of course, too. after i accepted this, this really turned out to be a gripping, emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful kung fu (i'm not an expert, though). the lead actress semra turan is not only denmark's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance, so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress. rest of the supporting cast is okay, camera good, kung fu intense. sidenotes: - the male turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right. - the audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge. - xian gao, a chinese cinematic kung fu instructor/actor (hidden tiger, crouching dragon) played the lead role's master<br /><br />if you get the chance to see this in cinema do it, you'll probably have a good and intense experience and i don't know if this works on small screen as well
