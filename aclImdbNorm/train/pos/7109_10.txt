first off, let's start with the negative points: 1) there are huge, gaping wholes in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered; 2) the movie is not for all people, so impolite viewers will get restless and start yapping during the movie.<br /><br />point two above is important because the movie is very quiet. in an older type theater (like the one i went to), you can hear the reel going through the projector at times. i loved that. the movie does not keep you busy with music, nor effects: it lets you reflect upon what is happening.<br /><br />there is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable. the same kind of atmosphere generated by stanley kubrick in eyes wide shut. not for all people.<br /><br />i would highly recommend it to fans of cinema, as the cinematographic work is amazing. those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed. it's the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards. (my version of it is pretty darn cool, but probably quite off-track!) if you do go catch the movie, there is one very cool part: when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones. an ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. hats off to the person that thought of doing this.
