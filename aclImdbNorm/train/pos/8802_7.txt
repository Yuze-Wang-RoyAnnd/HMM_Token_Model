this is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant. gathering 11 prominent international directors and allotting each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; each short exploring the global reverberations of 9/11. without using any spoilers, i would say that ken loach's piece is the jewel in the crown, and mira nair's short (segment "india"), based on a true story, deserves to be made into a full feature film. one also realizes, while watching his short, why alejandro gonz'alez i~n'arritu is one of the best directors in the world today
