a chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist, warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war japan, is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life. his loving wife, who supports totally her husband and his ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. this movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. sayuri yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn't get an asian oscar for the best female role in 2009. it went to a young girl with very limited acting potential.<br /><br />this deeply moving and most 'human' feature is a must see for all 'true children' on earth.
