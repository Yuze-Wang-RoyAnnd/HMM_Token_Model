this highly underrated film is (to me) what good writing in a movie should be all about. kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at. the movie is about the divides people create to insulate themselves from the violence and hatred and bigotry of everyday life. <br /><br /> along the way we are asked question after question about life. davis (steve martin with a great beard) asks himself 'is my making a violent movie (and by extension our enjoyment of it) causing the violence in society?' claire asks "what kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life?' mack is not immune as he asks 'is it possible to pass beyond the bounds of race and (an even harder step) finance? these are of course not quoted from the film, but generalities. others ask their questions too, and to be honest it raises more than it answers.<br /><br /> but that is the nature of life. we strive all our lives to find answers to questions we will never totally answer, and in certain cases have to make answers fit to our own needs and desires. as humans we thrive on questions we cannot answer. some answers are real. claire and mack come to realize that even though they could take the easy road and let the state take the baby, their finding it placed the responsibility for her life in their hands. some answers are not. davis `sees the light' and decides not to make violent films, but the next day turns around and dismisses his epiphany as subordinate to his art.<br /><br /> we all seek answers. this movie does not answer them for; it simply reminds you to keep looking for the answers.<br /><br />
