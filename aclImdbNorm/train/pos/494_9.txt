this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series. it has a "down to earth"-kind of feel with darker and less "plaggy" scenography.<br /><br />the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential. one thing that is fairly disappointing (with all star trek series really) is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else. (earth has stopped war, famine etc)<br /><br /> the female characters here are two, subcommander t'pol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human. hoshi is quite wimpy and t'pol is made to be a "vulcan babe".<br /><br /> some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american (as opposed to the more international feel of the tng-crew) but creates interesting dynamics.<br /><br /> a very good pilot though for a very good series.
