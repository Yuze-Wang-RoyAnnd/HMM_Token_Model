robert stack never really got over losing a best supporting actor oscar for his role as kyle in "written on the wind" to anthony quinn's 12-minute performance in "lust for life." stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. he has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, mitch, played by rock hudson. they both love the same woman, lucy, (lauren bacall), who becomes kyle's wife. kyle's sister, marylee (dorothy malone), is a drunken slut who's in love with mitch. their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of douglas sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including "imitation of life," "all that heaven allows," "magnificent obsession," and many others.<br /><br />make no mistake - this is a potboiler, and stack and dorothy malone make the most of their roles, malone winning a best supporting actress oscar. there's one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase. we're led to believe that marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy that pumps the gas, because she's in love with mitch. mitch wants nothing to do with her. he's so in love with lucy that, out of loyalty to kyle, he wants to go to work in iran to avoid temptation. i doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was.<br /><br />hudson and bacall have the less exciting roles here - hudson's mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up kyle's messes for his entire life, and bacall is mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players.<br /><br />in sirk's hands, "written on the wind" is an effective film, and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting. the director had a gift for this type of movie, and though he had many imitators, he never had an equal.
