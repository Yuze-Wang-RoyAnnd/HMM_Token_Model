i loved the story. somewhere, a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film. well maybe there ought to be. i thought everybody seemed really human and believable. what a top notch cast. what great music on the soundtrack. what a nice this, and what a nice that, but most of all, i will say two words to recommend this film.<br /><br />steve carell.<br /><br />he really showed a nice, subtle depth that touched me. he was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first, at the cost of denying his own needs.<br /><br />did he act like a petulant ass? why, yes he did.<br /><br />and you see, that's what was perfect about this film. the actor who played this character made me believe he was feeling something, and not simply acting like he was feeling something, and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling, and what he was feeling was denied.<br /><br />denied happiness.<br /><br />denied fulfillment.<br /><br />denied love.<br /><br />losing your love is painful beyond belief, and many who do so will never feel something like that again.<br /><br />beautiful film.<br /><br />i gave it an eight out of ten.
