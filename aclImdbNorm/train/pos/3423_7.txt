do not expect a depiction of the "truth". however, the accounts of these veterans of the iraqi & afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration. <br /><br />the major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post-war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives. <br /><br />my major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military's and veterans affairs' programs for helping those who've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war. these are not fatal flaws of the film.<br /><br />as a veteran myself, i know that the horrible aftermath of war is real, and these young men and women articulate it very well. these vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
