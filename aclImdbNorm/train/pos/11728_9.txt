there are two things that i like about elvira, and they're both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up: her wit and her talent. a movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention. looking like a combined clone of morticia adams and anna nicole smith, she inherits a distant relative's estate only to discover that she is really the heiress of the occult. the comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling. it's mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the rioting mob or the fleeing heroine who trips and stumbles on her heels. my favorite part is when she uses her marvelous endowments to break the chains keeping her locked in the cemetary. the ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the bradys, but the las vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie.
