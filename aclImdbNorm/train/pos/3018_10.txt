this movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is worser than the original. its comedy at its best. this movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second. at more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a joke.<br /><br />its a big advantage to have seen the first movie but its not a requirement.<br /><br />g"ota kanal 2 also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production tv series such as survivor (expediton: robinson in swedish) this is a swedish movie for the swedish audience. thus don't see it if you aren't familiar with sweden and its language. otherwise: have fun! johan
