i recently bought this movie with a bunch of other laserdiscs from ebay. usually, i am into war and action movies but occasionally i enjoy romantic comedies.<br /><br />if you are bored by today's special fx films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out shop around the corner on a quiet evening. what i like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. there is nothing fake or pretentious about them. take mr. matuschek for example: when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself. not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of stewart. (ok, weired example.) <br /><br />yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable. yet still, i liked it a lot. if you likes notting hill then you will like shop around the corner. in fact, hugh grant reminds me a lot of jimmy stewart.
