arguebly al pacino's best role. he plays tony montana, a small time hood from cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in miami, and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesn't break'em for nobody. starts as doing jobs for a big time cuban dealer, frank lopez (robert loggia) and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend manny (steven bauer). soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife elvira (michelle pfeiffer). after frank sees a threat from tony to his position, he attempts to assassin tony but with no luck. tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is f. murray abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiar face is harris yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down tony, marry elizabeth mastrantonio as tony's young sister. credits to the ecxellent screenplay by oliver stone. this film is one of brian depalma's brightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see this guy is very talented. the movie has a magnificent look to it. also pay attention for two memorable scenes: the one at the fancy restaurant ("say goodnight to the bad guy"). the other is the final shootout where tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie i have ever seen. for fans of al pacino and crime movies it's a must-see. for the rest of you it's highly recommended. 10/10
