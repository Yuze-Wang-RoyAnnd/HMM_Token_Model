every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human. lawrence kasden done this again. i always felt thebg cill was the anthem of it's age and he has managed to do it again in grand canyon. every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it. this is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice. the juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius. i have watched this film a number of times and am constanly surprised at how deep the emotions run through this film. danny glover and kevin kline do their roles with great tenderness and stever martins portrayal of a movie exec is priceless. thank you again mr. kasden
