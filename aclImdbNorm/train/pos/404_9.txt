this is like "crouching tiger, hidden dragon" in a more surreal, fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame. the plot may be hard to follow, but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen; certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience. however, an intelligent person should be able to keep up; moreover, the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi.
