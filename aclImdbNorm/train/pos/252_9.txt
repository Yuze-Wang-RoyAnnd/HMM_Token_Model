the performances were superb, the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian, i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail.<br /><br />i wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge. do not expect, as some rather silly people do, any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during infancy.<br /><br />ok, the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film. gregor jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here.<br /><br />see it and you will not be sorry
