i thought the movie "i do they don't" was fantastic. in the past i've watched rob estes on "suddenly susan" & "melrose place" and also josie bissett on "melrose place" and loved seeing them together again in "i do they don't". they have great chemistry together (i guess being married in real life helps that!) - in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball. of course they stumble, but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about. so many people have been talking about this movie - all good! - and the movie left us wanting more. this would make a great series - appealing to many ages! - it would be so nice to see a real life, down to earth, family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so called "reality tv" that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days. someone tell the people at abc family they have the start of a new series here!
