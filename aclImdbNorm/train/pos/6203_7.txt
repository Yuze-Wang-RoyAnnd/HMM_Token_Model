a wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels. parker posey plays fay grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she seems. the story is very tongue in cheek, and the dialog skillfully understated. hints of humor and intrigue, neither of which overpower the characterization posey pulls off so well. the supporting cast is stellar. the downside? this film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes. posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body. she's worth your time, even if you don't understand the denouement.
