this film is one of those nostalgia things with me and i never really expect anyone else to "get it" but am pleased when i recommend it and somebody does enjoy it. my late father hated arthur askey but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for "the ghost train" and "old ted 'olmes" transferred to me as a child. years later, i watch it every now and again, enjoying the familiarity. i always wonder if it will not be quite the same but i am never disappointed in it. there is much to enjoy. the sequence on the train is truly inspired when askey and murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger. then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up. yes, it is dated and full of wartime britishness in accents and plot (based on the original play by arnold ridley of dad's army fame!) but full of wonderful character performances - including kathleen harrison as a dotty spinster. the atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an arthur askey vehicle could get. this is available cheap as chips in the uk on dvd so treat yourself. it is a perfect saturday/sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of entertainment. i thank you....<br /><br />old movies can be good movies!
