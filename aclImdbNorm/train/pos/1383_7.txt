the original title means "the birth of the octopuses". i must confess that i do not quite understand this title. the english title is "water lilies". but after having written this, i read the comment by another user: "the title in french is also suggestive: "prieuve", or octopus, suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously." thanks for your explanation.<br /><br />the basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex. it is no different for boys. i think that both floriane and marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures.<br /><br />much of the movie is water ballet. sometimes the girls will have their heads downwards, and nothing above the water except their feet and lowers legs, with which they will wave and kick in the air. to people like me who had never seen such things before, it was fascinating. - floriane is the leader of one team of "water lilies". <br /><br />marie tells her that she would like to see when floriane is training. this seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary. soon they will walk together. floriane takes marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her, and then goes away with him for an hour, while marie is waiting for her to return. i took for granted that the couple slept with each other. but we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that. <br /><br />i can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere. there is a scene in which marie secretly steals floriane's garbage bag. in it she finds an apple, mostly eaten. and marie proceeds to eat the rest.
