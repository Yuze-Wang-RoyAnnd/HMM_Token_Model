i agree that capital city should be on dvd. i watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with rolf saxon as hudson talbot. it was nice to see americans who work abroad in london in the financial industry for a change. i loved rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. i can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. i liked william armstrong as hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. when they aired this show in the new york city area, it was always late at night or at off times. the show is less than an hour long. i felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. i didn't care for sylvia but missed the actress, julia phillips-lane in the previous season. i felt this show took chances and often it worked. it showed americans who loved and chose to live in london. the american characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their british counterparts. i also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all british. i liked watching julia ormond in an early role. i felt this show should have lasted longer. i felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. they could have transferred the cast to new york city and it would have been a hit in america.
