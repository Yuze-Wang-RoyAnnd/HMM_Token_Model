"the ladies man" suffers a common problem among movies based on "saturday night live" skits. and that is, a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes. although this movie does have its laughs, like tim meadows as leon phelps, a sex-maniac straight out of the '70s, and will ferrell as a wrestling-obsessed husband cuckolded by leon. so this movie is funny enough, but it's no "wayne's world"!
