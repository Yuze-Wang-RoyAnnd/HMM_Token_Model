believe it or not, at 12 minutes, this film (for 1912) is a full-length film. very, very few films were longer than that back then, but that is definitely not what sets this odd little film apart from the rest! no, what's different is that all the actors (with the exception of one frog) are bugs...yes, bugs! this simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of chaplin, laurel and hardy or max linder but instead this russian production uses bugs (or, i think, models that looked just like bugs). chaplin and laurel and hardy were yet to be discovered and i assume linder was busy, so perhaps that's why they used bugs! using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well--and a heck of a lot more realistically than king kong 21 years later! <br /><br />the film starts with mr. beetle sneaking off for a good time. he goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home. but, unfortunately for mr. beetle, he is caught on camera by a local film buff. plus, he doesn't know it but mrs. beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter. of course, there's a lot more to this domestic comedy than this, but the plot is age-old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike.<br /><br />weird but also very amazing and watchable.
