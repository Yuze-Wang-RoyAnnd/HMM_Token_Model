this is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word 'horror' in order for it to be appreciated. the main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and, as with most younger children, he gets frightened easily. mainly because he simply doesn't understand things, like why his father is hardly ever there for him. from watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it, but the little boy doesn't. also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods, as it is established early on in the film, that the family is from the city. also, in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer, then get held up, then they argue with the locals about it, and the little boy surely didn't find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all.<br /><br />the "wendigo" is ultimately what his young, innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this. there is the american indian legend, but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it, it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically. not because that's what the wendigo actually is, but because that is how he understands it. when you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it. obviously it was low-budget and shot cheaply, but the jumping montages, use of light, and general eeriness more than make up for it. and the final question the film asks is: is it all in your head, or is it really out there? 8/10<br /><br />rated r: profanity, violence, and a sex scene
