where the sidewalk ends is quite a good film-noir crime drama and is shot well in black and white and on location as well.<br /><br />a copper accidentally kills a bloke who is suspected of murder and to protect himself, he covers this up and blames it on another person he doesn't like who has committed a lot of crimes in the past. but towards the end, he owns up but not before falling in love with a woman he meets who is the lover of the person he killed...<br /><br />the cast includes dana andrews (while the city sleeps, curse of the demon), gene tierney (laura, the ghost and mrs muir), gary merrill (mysterious island), karl malden (the streets of san francisco, beyond the posidon adventure) and craig stevens (the deadly mantis). good parts from all.<br /><br />where the sidewalk ends is worth checking out if you get the chance. excellent.<br /><br />rating: 3 stars out of 5.
