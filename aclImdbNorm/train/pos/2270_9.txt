the movie is a bit "thin" after reading the book, but it's still one of the greatest movies ever made. sheryl lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really "vonneguty". he makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film. not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does.
