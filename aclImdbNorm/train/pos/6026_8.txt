this film has a powerful philosophical ending. but that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning.<br /><br />youth alienation in the late 1960's, from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of "zabriskie point". neither mark frechette nor daria halprin had much acting experience, a fact that actually enhances the film's message. having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism, as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them.<br /><br />this is not a script-driven film. except for the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with stunning cinematography. the beautiful naturalistic images seem other-worldly, and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of mark and daria.<br /><br />i would have replaced the thematically weak pink floyd music with the more cogent music of the doors. many scenes cry out for "riders on the storm".<br /><br />even so, i like this film. it's different; it's unique; it is artistic and imaginative. and the desert badlands are beautiful.<br /><br />as the years go by, "zabriskie point" seems more and more attractive. it conveys the mood of the late 1960's in america. it is amazingly artistic, in a bohemian sort of way. and the film's last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing.
