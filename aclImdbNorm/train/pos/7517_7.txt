although the notorious bettie page is well acted and shot, is is, at best, a cliffs notes version of bettie's biography. the film mainly centers on her work with irving and paula klaw, the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos. it does not detail her life after posing, aside from her religious rebirth. it cites "the real bettie page", by richard foster as a source, but it ignores bettie's later years of mental illness and incarceration in a mental hospital. the narrow focus of the biography can be debated, but the majority of bettie's fans and the "civilians" would probably be more interested in her modeling career, which is what they get.<br /><br />the film is well acted, with gretchen mol faithfully reproducing the look of bettie, as well as conveying the sweetness that her photos exuded. the character is played as rather naive, a probable byproduct of interviews given by bettie in recent years. it is more likely that bettie was aware of the nature of her photos but rationalized it as acting and costumes.<br /><br />the supporting cast is also outstanding, with chris bauer and lili taylor playing irving and paula klaw, and david strathairn as estes kefauver. the film errs with the character of john willie, played by jared harris. john willie never met bettie page and was not involved in photo shoots with the klaws. harris plays willie a bit like peter o'toole, in his more debauched state.<br /><br />despite the quality of acting, the film is a bit of a disappointment in terms of depth. the story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know bettie. much like her photos, it's just an image. it does tend to exaggerate bettie's notoriety. her photos were mainly seen in and around new york, in a very narrow market of underground and cultish publications. her real fame came after her photos were reprinted in the late 70's and 80's, and the cult of betty page (as her name was usually spelled) grew. bettie's greatest exposure (pardon the pun) was in playboy, appearing in the january 1955 issue (the christmas photo, which is staged in reverse in the film).<br /><br />the film is well done, if rather shallow. it is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances. it hits the high points of bettie's life, but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth. the ending is rather a let down. it feels rather abrupt. still, the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in bettie, or even the time period. the soundtrack is great, really pulling the viewer into the 1950's. if nothing else, the film stands as a showcase for america's burgeoning sexuality and the clash with its puritan past. it's also a peek at an icon for both men and women.
