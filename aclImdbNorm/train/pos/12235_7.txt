"the incredible melting man" is a fantastically gross, trashy and energetic z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself! the ideal way to describe this low-budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of hammer's "the quatermass xperiment" ...only a thousand times filthier! astronaust steve west is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! in shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. doctor ted nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. the premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of rick baker. the melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like darth vader! another big advantage is that william sachs' screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. the repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film. just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, you'll miss out on all the campy fun!
