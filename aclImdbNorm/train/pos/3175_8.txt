it's great how this movie pulls you along. i had honest laughs. don't care that it's low budget cause the thing works for me. to be honest my wife didn't really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film. she did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string. these characters who's lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world. just keep going and be who you are. dreams are what you make of them. in watching this movie a second and third time i realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through. what can i say, i like my fun with some complexity. anyway liked it. hope to see more.
