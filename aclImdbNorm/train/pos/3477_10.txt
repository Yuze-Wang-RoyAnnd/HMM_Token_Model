some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined..i disagree totally.the shows quality did not go up or down and scrappy ,win my opinion,as a very good chrecter.i looked at a poll on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said scrappys second series was scoobys downfall.ok so loads said yes but 28%still cant be wrong.i do like the way most of the episodes focused on comedy.i believe the show would have gone rubbish if it was the same 5 people/dog solving mystery in same formula.scrappy was a breath of fresh air to the show.sure,some people tuned out but when scrappy was introduced viewing figures doubled.back to the show.all the episodes and segments were very funny.i was intriguded by the yabba shorts and .but at the end of the day its a matter of opinion if you like scrappy or not is a matter of opinion,there is certainly no fact involved.but in my opinion this was a superb series that gave a beginning to tire show a new formula and lease of life.nuff said.
