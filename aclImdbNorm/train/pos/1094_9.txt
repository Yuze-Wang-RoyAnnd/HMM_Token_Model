this is one of the few comedies i can watch again and again and still laugh out loud. in other places, i have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct prigs. there is neither here, unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid.<br /><br />the lines are hilarious, and all the leads have never been better. melvin douglas is especially brilliant.<br /><br />if you've ever thought of or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process, no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel, you are not alone!
