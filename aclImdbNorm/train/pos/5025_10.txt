man, some of you people have got to chill. this movie was artistic genius. instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality, why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction? a story. entertainment, for god's sake (no pun intended). it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics--and they're not doing to well. i'm so impressed by the movie and bill paxton's job at directing, that i'm going to contact him personally to tell him. ya know, if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line, you might just enjoy the film. me and all of my friends did!
