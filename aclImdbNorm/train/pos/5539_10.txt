when i watched this film the first time, it was a taped copy and the title was/is caged terror. i still own the tape, and i confess, i've watched it more than once from beginning to end! the film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing! i have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we've had some great laughs from the terrible script. the film concerns a couple, (remember this is like early 70's so they are just too hip man!) who go on a week-end camping trip in what i believe was supposed to be upstate ny. they have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it! the guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them, and he goes; "and that's beautiful man!" heavy man, really heavy! lol! anyway, along come a couple of vietnam vets, one of who plays the flute, i believe. (at any rate they are musical fellows!) the guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly, they end up terrorizing them during the night. the guy ends up caged in a chicken coop, and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys. actually, by the end of the night, she seems to be pretty into it, and when morning comes, the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave. supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) anyway, i would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh! it never fails to amuse me anyway! if i could find this on dvd and replace my old tape copy, i'd actually buy it again, it's classic camp! you gotta love this stuff!
