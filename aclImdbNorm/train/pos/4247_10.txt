the girl from missouri arrives in new york city knowing exactly what she wants: to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. with her knockout good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a tycoon, but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love?<br /><br />jean harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy. with her platinum hair & gorgeous accouterments, she is a dazzler. but her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress. she has rightfully earned her spot at the very top of the hollywood pantheon.<br /><br />an excellent cast gives harlow fine support: lionel barrymore as the wily old tycoon, wise to harlow's ways; handsome franchot tone as his son, smitten with love; raucous patsy kelly, stealing her scenes as harlow's sidekick; debonair alan mowbray, as a well-mannered english lord; elderly clara blandick as barrymore's feisty secretary; hearty hale hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies; muscular nat pendleton as a lifeguard who catches kelly's flirtatious eye; and lewis stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupted businessman.<br /><br />it should be noted that this film was produced soon after hollywood's production code was instituted. a comparison with red-headed woman, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which harlow's character goes after the same ends, but uses very different means.
