********spoilers--careful*********<br /><br />what can i say? i'm biased when it comes to urban cowboy. i love it and have watched it countless times--and usually find out something new about it with each viewing.<br /><br />i think one of the things i like about it is that urban cowboy is about working class people, not rich people who live in either l.a. or new york. well, it is true except for pam.<br /><br />travolta plays bud, a small town texas boy who moves to houston to work in the oil fields. and this is when travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like saturday night fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys/good guys in big budget movies. this is a really good movie--the mechanical bull riding contest and two-step dancing may be silly, but you have to enjoy this for what it is.<br /><br />bud meets sissy (played by debra winger with slutty brilliance)--and soon after, they are married and living in their dream trailer. but their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes. bud wants to be a real cowboy. sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. but in modern times, men's roles are not as clear. where can bud prove he's a real man? he can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by night--he can be a "urban cowboy." but sissy wants to drive his pick-up truck, and she wants to ride the mechanical bull, too. so where does this leave bud? as sissy asserts her independence, she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex-con and prison rodeo star--a real bull rider--, wes (played wonderfully greasy by scott glenn). bud is threatened, and bud and sissy break up.<br /><br />sissy shacks up with wes, who abuses her. emasculating himself further, bud becomes the boy toy of pam, a rich girl whose daddy is in oil and all that implies. sissy comes by the trailer to clean it up--pam doesn't do that kind of thing. she writes a make up letter to bud, but evil pam tears it up and takes the credit for sissy's housework.<br /><br />bud's uncle bob dies tragically at work when lightening strikes and causes an explosion. bud and sissy have a chance at reconciliation, but are too stubborn. later the mechanical bull riding competition is at gilley's, and you know bud is going to win. pam realizes that bud doesn't love her, but sissy--he did it for her. wes tries to rob gilleys, but wouldn't you know that urban cowboy, bud, saves the day and wins back the woman he loves.<br /><br />of course, you may ask yourself why bud and sissy would go to gilleys about every night and "live like pigs." maybe that contributed to their bad marriage. or why didn't bud stay with pam--she wasn't that bad and had money. or why they had to kill off uncle bob. or why bud and sissy had such stupid friends like marshall and jessie who were always trying to break them up: marshall says to bud, "she {sissy} rides that bull better than you do!" but part of the fun of urban cowboy is making fun of it a little bit--and saying, isn't that bonnie raitt on the stage!
