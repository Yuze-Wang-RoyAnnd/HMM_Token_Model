having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer i had to see this movie. with william h. macy, luis guzman, michael jeter and sam rockwell present it had to be good. and it delivered. overall, the movie is not crack-you-up funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and is, in a my eyes, a classic. spoiler at the end, where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see rockwell and washington stare at jeter is just fantastic. this is just as good as the scene in the big lebowski where the dude is using a chair to barricade his door, but forgets the door turns outward! end spoiler just go see this movie, you won't be disappointed.
