this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that should not be missed by any fan of french new wave or underground film. there are barely opening or closing credits--we are just dropped into the world of consumerist art, revolution, and youth. this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality. lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary, but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing, not for describing the real.
