a bit slow (somehow like a sofia coppola movie) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age. the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life. the music is perfect and the acting is amazing. the camera works beautifully also. i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period. so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities.
