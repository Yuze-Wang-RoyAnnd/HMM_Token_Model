when i was six yo, i learned about a series called "los campeones", and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch "the champions" and "the avengers" once every week. i think that was the golden age of english series... (i already own the complete cycle of "the prisoner"!) but lasted also a few years later with "the tomorrow people", "the worst witch" (i just me, or this is "harry potter" in girl, of course, before as much as i want "the campions" to be in zone 1 or zone 4, i'm also waiting for "dr. who" (pack the whole series in a set of, uhm, maybe 300 dvd's, please, i couldn't expend more for it, 8), "people of tomorrow", and several other 'low budget', but great stories to be available within my reached zones. i speak and understand english, but not all my relatives do, including my parents, whom introduced me into these great stories... i hope someday, someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them... dubbed or subtitled, but in the same format i saw them. remember, zone 1 or 4 are ok with my tv set!
