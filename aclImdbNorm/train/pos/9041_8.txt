based on fact, this is the story of a teenager named homer hickam (jake gyllenhaal), growing up in a coal town in west virginia where a boy's usual destiny was to "end up in the mines." but homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets, to the dismay of his mine-foreman father, and the consternation of the townsfolk generally. a misfit for sure, he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets, which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town, so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft-times errant rockets. unfortunately, most of the town and especially homer's father (chris cooper) thinks that they are wasting their time. however, the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the 'rocketboys' send off their homemade missiles. only one teacher (laura dern) in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize. now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars. director joe johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as jumanji & jurassic park 3 & "october sky" surely stands above all of his other films. without any doubts, "october sky" is his best effort & obviously his best film. it's not only a true story filmed extremely well, but even as a movie, it has every single thing, which is required for a top level cinema. and along with johnston's extra-ordinary direction, are some exceptional performances. jake gyllenhaal was around 19, when this movie was released & he gives a beautiful & natural performance. he is a perfect actor. chris cooper as his father, also gives a very fine performance. the same goes for laura dern & also she looks beautiful. even the rest of the performances are extremely well. the background score was fine. highly inspiring movie, which lifts up your spirit sky high. one of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life. an amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment. not to be missed.
