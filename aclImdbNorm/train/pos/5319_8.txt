forget that this is a "b" movie. forget that it is in many ways outdated. instead give writer-director ida lupino much deserved credit for addressing a subject which at the time (1950) was taboo in hollywood. to my knowledge, this was the first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that crime has upon its victims.<br /><br />although much of the cast's acting is pedestrian at best, mala powers, who at the time was eighteen or nineteen, gives an excellent performance throughout as the traumatized young woman, ann, who tries to run away from her "shame." based on her work in this film, i'm surprised that she did not have a more successful acting career. tod andrews, too, has some fine moments as the minister who reaches out to help her.<br /><br />ms lupino, obviously working on a limited budget, was still able to create some memorable scenes such as the pursuit through the streets and alleys leading to the rape, and the police lineup following it. and, she created a bittersweet ending which left me wondering if ann really could ever have a normal life again.
