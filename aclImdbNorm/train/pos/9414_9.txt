although most americans have little knowledge of his work other than star wars, alec guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. i particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from hollywood.<br /><br />this being said, this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies. it's plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere--except for ealing studios--which had a particular fondness for "little" films like this one.<br /><br />guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company. he wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work! so, he tends to sneak into labs (either during the day if no one suspects or at night) and try his hand at inventing. repeatedly, he is caught (such as after he blew up the lab) and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds! then, despite the importance of the discovery, he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events--and then the fun begins.<br /><br />the film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry, unions, the government and people in general.
