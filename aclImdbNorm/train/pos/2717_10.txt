i can't remember many details about the show, but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes. unfortunately at the time we had no vcr, so i haven't ever seen the series again. however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on. sam waterstone was my favorite actor these days (i think i was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day, mostly due to his appearance in the series. i would gladly buy/steal/download this series, i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone... any ideas? does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing?
