i loved this masterpiece and quite frankly i, too found mary poppins (although i love julie andrews and dick vandyke) to be silly and sacrine-sweet. angela lansbury plays her character to perfection and i don't know why people think of this film as distorted. it was magical and it was lots of fun to watch. every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better. you truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other, despite their age and differences. i thought the characters were well developed, especially charles who was at "the age of not believing". mary poppins may be more popular and cherished by others but this little gem will be the one that i will always love and cherish.
