sure star wars (a movie i have seen at least fifty times) beats all the others in special effects, but this film has every thing else!<br /><br />it has horror(non-graphical), romance, robots, witty repartee, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects, and drama.<br /><br />i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print, and i was amazed at how well it held up today. i thought the old 40's style electronics would look hokey, but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne.<br /><br />ann francis in here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me.<br /><br />the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me.<br /><br />of course we all know that the "great bird of the galaxy" probably modeled much of "star trek" from this movie.<br /><br />no one has yet to beat robby, the robot, in terms of personality<br /><br />(sorry, r2d2 and c3po).<br /><br />this movie, overall, is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to!<br /><br />honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles.
