the theory of flight is an engaging character study of an artist (branagh) yearning to break free of boredom and mediocrity, and a terminally ill patient (bonham-carter) in the last stages of asl, confined to a wheelchair, who desires to make love to a man before dying.<br /><br />helena bonham-carter exudes wit, defiance, and independence as an asl patient who is virtually dependent upon people around her to take care of her.<br /><br />kenneth branagh, sentenced through community service to take part in caring for her, complements helena's charm with woeful melancholy, creating a sentimental, compelling love story in which two people try to help each other find the road to happiness, before time runs out.
