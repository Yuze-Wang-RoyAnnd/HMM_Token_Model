very intelligent humor excellent performing i can't believe how people could think it deserves a 1/10! i hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it if you ever have the opportunity, watch it... don't miss it there is a part when the principal actors are driving and singing "happy birthday" and "el payaso plinplin" (an argentinian song for kids (i think... it could also be south american, i'm not sure)). this two songs that have the same melody... but people don't usually realize that... it's just grate! i tried to write this in both spanish and english, because it's an argentinian movie... but the page wouldn't allow me :( hope you enjoy it!
