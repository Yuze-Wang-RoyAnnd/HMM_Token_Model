wow, i forgot how great this movie was until i stumbled upon it while looking through the garage. it's a kind of strange combination of a bio of michael jackson, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids. the vignettes are good (especially speed demon), but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment, in which michael jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and it's just as weird as it sounds). joe pesci is hilarious, and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout!<br /><br />the real gem however is the incredible "smooth criminal" video, which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone!
