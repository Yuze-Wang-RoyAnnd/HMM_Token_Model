i have found this movie available for streaming on netflix and thought i'd give it a try.<br /><br />the plot revolves around ryan and theo taylor (colm feore and david cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away. ryan and theo at first argue about who did what. but later, theo finds out that his brother ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness. so, ryan and theo spend their time patching up their differences.<br /><br />this is such an incredible film. i have only seen colm feore in season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this. david cubitt, an actor i have never heard of before did a phenomenal job as well.<br /><br />i would recommend this to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre. this is one movie you don't want to miss.<br /><br />i give this film 10 stars out of 10. excellent film!
