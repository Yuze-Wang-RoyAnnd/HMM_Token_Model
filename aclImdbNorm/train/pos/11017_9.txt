this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded.this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights,a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well,an exciting plot,and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways.the movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play.the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human,much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters.they chose to humanise stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style,weakens the excitement factor.also,the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times.the script should have been more realistic and less "talky".another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes.the movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses.they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie.instead,they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences (ala "a-team" tv series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops.this movie had a lot of all time great potential.crisper action sequences,better dialogue and more rambo/rocky style emotion/determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level.i know this was not stallone's fault.i sense the movie's director wanted to tone down stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer.sill a good movie though........
