wow this was a great italian "zombie" movie by two great director's luci fulci ("zombie") and bruno mattie ("hell of the living dead") lucio started this movie and was ill so the great bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than i expected it to turn out so if you have seen "hell of the living dead" directed by bruno mattie and if you saw "zombie" directed by lucio fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great "zombie" make-up witch equals great looking "zombies" has a funny "zombie" flying head!and "zombie" birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a "zombie" (that only happed to two people) but they are mainly just the great toxic "zombies" like in bruno matties "hell of the living dead".so if you like italian "zombie" movies or just "zombie" movie's in general than check this one out its a great italian "zombie" movie!
