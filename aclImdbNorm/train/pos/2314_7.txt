i had heard good things about this film and was, you guessed it, a bit disappointed. reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; really all the (small) cast are quite solid, in their simple 50s american setting. the reason i didn't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end, the grief shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit. perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot, or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer. maureen's character is quite underdeveloped i think. it is understandable that dani (reese w., the younger) would be traumatised and angry, but why is her sister shown to be more upset? because she's a few years older? hasn't the end rather undermined the rest of the film? the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met, when he gets tractored (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit. well it works!). it depends what you want - if you want the girls' happy story of young love that it seems like you're going to get, you're in for a surprise. man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film
