gene kelly, frank sinatra, kathryn grayson, and jose iturbi star in "anchors aweigh," directed by george sidney.<br /><br />kelly and sinatra are joe and clarence, two navy guys on leave in hollywood. they meet a little boy (dean stockwell) and on taking him home, they meet his aunt (grayson). clarence falls for her. she wants an audition for jose iturbi. they try to help, but there's a mix-up.<br /><br />this is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by kelly and sinatra. kelly gets to dance with jerry the mouse in a delightful sequence. grayson sings jalousie and my heart sings. not one of my favorite voices, but she does well. iturbi's piano work is beautiful.<br /><br />sinatra gets to show his versatility and why the girls swooned over him, with those big blue eyes and boyish face. for kelly, this was a major break for him at mgm.<br /><br />wonderful movie, very buoyant.
