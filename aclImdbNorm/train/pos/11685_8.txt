i found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian (chris rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid-50's white mans body. he doesn't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before. he listens to rap music, sings along, and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man. the real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community.
