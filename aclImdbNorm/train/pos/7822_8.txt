it's sad to view this film now that we know how the anc got shafted by international capitalism. biko died for nothing much. woods achieved little. yes, outright apartheid was abolished, but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites, leaving the anc government more or less impotent. as naomi klein writes in the shock doctrine, in the talks between the black and white leaderships "the deklerk government had a twofold strategy. first drawing on the ascendant washington consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy, it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making --- such as trade policy and the central bank --- as "technical" or "adminsitrative". then it used a wide range of new policy tools --- international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs --- to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts, economists and officials from the imf, the world bank, the gatt and the national party --- anyone except the liberation fighters from the anc." the statistical results are horrifying, with not much change accomplished, and aids flourishing. viewing cry freedom in this light is deeply ironic --- actually tragic. the anc has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem.
