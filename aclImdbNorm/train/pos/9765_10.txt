i saw this jolly little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on cbs. i didn't know it had been in a theater at all. to rate it from a kids point of view i'd give it 4 out of 5 stars,because being a young boy at the time,it seemed a little "girlish".<br /><br />the climactic scene where gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing. <br /><br />when i re-discovered it a blockbuster video in 1995,i had to revisit it! i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit "old". i don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on vhs.<br /><br />it's out there. might even be on dvd by now,at least i hope it is. i want to share it with my kids someday! 10 stars on here,it's still a great kids film.
