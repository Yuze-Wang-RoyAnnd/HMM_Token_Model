this movie is incredible.with great characters,specially the old swordsman that can fly in the shape of fireball and jump across the trees,this film tells a classic story of battle between good and forces of evil.the final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool.<br /><br />very,very recommendable.not for the smallest children though.this one deserves a 10.
