i don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad, unless i'm just off my rocker. i found it sick, brilliant, twisted, and psychologically sophisticated. you won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one. it has layers within layers, nuanced acting by stone,and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over. people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48,and that michael douglas isn't in this one. i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. give it a shot, you might be glad you did!
