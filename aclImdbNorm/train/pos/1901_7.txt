it's hard to put your finger on this one. basically i suppose it's a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a (comparatively) poor girl, whom he wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family.<br /><br />it has funny moments, romantic moments, and touching moments. dudley moore is funny and somehow makes his self-centred character endearing, liza minelli is a convincing foil as the the feisty opposite he attracts, but john gielgud steals the show as arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler.<br /><br />it's corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for nearly 3 months at our local fleapit.
