i haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. i got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because i had been dying to see it. i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. the audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />kudos to steve carrell(who i had already been a fan of). he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. he has a style that i haven't seen before. and catherine keener is excellent as always. thank god there wasn't a cameo from will ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer).<br /><br />there were parts of comedic genius in this movie. partly thanks to carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also carrell). the waxing scene and the speed dater with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical.<br /><br />i will definitely go see '40 year old virgin' when it's released. my advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it.
