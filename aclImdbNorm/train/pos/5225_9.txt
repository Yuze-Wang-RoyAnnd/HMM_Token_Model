i think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best 'national lampoon's' films, it also has a very catchy spoof title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about.... men in white!!!! the story is a spoof of many films including a will smith film, as you might have guessed, 'men in black'. i will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny (leslie nielsen style humour) from start to finish, especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins (garbage cans). also, they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry (garbage collecting truck) in that scene too. the acting is not superb, actually, it is not very good, but that is what makes the film funny, it is a comedy, loosen up!! i love the story line, partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (or should it be un-subtle) they rip off all the other films. i am great fan of un-serious spoof films, but i am also a fan of the real thing, and with this films, it is hard to decide which is better, the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) or the actual film it is, but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films, it actually makes it even harder, but this film carries it off successfully. the two garbage men are so funny, it reminds me of a tv sketch show in the uk called 'little britain'. this film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best storyline, national lampoon's film to date!!
