i recently got the chance to view "the waterdance", and quite liked it. i don't really understand why its called that as there isn't really any dancing going on there, except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end. we are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie, invalids in a hospital. the story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story.unfortunately, you don't get to see movies like that today. im not "stuck in a time warp", im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but i really think the movie industry is deteriorating and there's much we can learn from old movies-by old movies i mean anything from 1920-1998.
