mahatma gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for india's freedom struggle ignored his own family and son, this movie is about his son hiralal who feels neglected because of mahatma gandhi's service to the society. the movie starts off in south africa where mahatma gandhi works as a barrister and fighting the cause of india's freedom against the british. hirarala arrives in south africa to help his dad who is a barrister, since gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to the society and as a result hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams, he gets married to his love gulab (bhoomika chawla) against his father's wishes. hiralal has ambitions to travel to england and become a barrister just like his dad but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony. this angers hiralal and the rift between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed. hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt, he loses his wife and children. akshaye khanna has give a stellar performance as hiralal gandhi.. all kudos to him, the direction and the script is fantastic, the picturization is excellent. overall an excellent movie and a must see. i give it a 10/10
