i've often wondered just how much casper was meant for children...with all the issues revolving around his identity (in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, as his home is a cemetery plot), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film. maybe casper was meant more as a morality play, or famous studios felt like breaking new ground in 'reality' cartoons.<br /><br />there's good boos tonight is a well-animated project-no doubt there. but, the plot development involving the fox (who becomes casper's friend, but meets a tragic end) is a concern.<br /><br />give famous studios credit--they tackle death with respect...but, the stark image of casper's mourning is rather graphic and disturbing for children (though the denouement does offer a happy ending, but i won't give away the ending), and the violence is rather steep, even for 1940's standards.<br /><br />this might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to children--but i wouldn't pop it into the vcr for a perky cartoon break.
