good story and excellent animation. the influence of frazetta and bakshi are obvious, and that's a good thing. anyone that enjoys conan the barbarian or the game dungeons and dragons should enjoy it. the battle between good and evil is clear cut even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral. most often in fantasy movies elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. anyone familiar with frazetta's, bakshi's, or even tolkien's work know they are not racist. anyone that enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie. it is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo. the casting was well done and the scenes and music are first rate. i hope someone puts this gem on dvd soon. i consider myself lucky to have a vhs copy in good condition.
