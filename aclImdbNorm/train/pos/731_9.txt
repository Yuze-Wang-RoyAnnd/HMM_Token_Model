this movie is soooo funny!!! the acting is wonderful, the ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his/her school. i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism. if you like monty python, you will love this film. this movie is a tad bit "grease"esk (without all the annoying songs). the songs that are sung are likable; you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through. this musical ranks number two in musicals to me (second next to the blues brothers). but please, do not think of it as a musical per say; seeing as how the songs are so likable, it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place. i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance. you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; needless to say, you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film. highly recommended for both the family (since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience.
