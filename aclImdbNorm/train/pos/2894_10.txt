as a young boy, i always sort of hated "cinderella," since i was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what disney movie to buy. i wanted "dumbo," but my sisters won out, and we got "cinderella." they thoroughly enjoyed the movie while i sulked in the back of the room playing with my star wars action figures.<br /><br />a lot has changed since then. my love of the disney theme parks landed me an internship at walt disney world, and i now have two young nieces. i like to showcase disney to them as much as i can, and we recently watched "cinderella" together. with my newfound appreciation for all that is disney, i watched "cinderella" with a new perspective and was impressed with what i saw.<br /><br />from the beginning of the movie, though, i didn't quite understand why cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament. why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away? i wasn't too sympathetic to cinderella, but as the story progressed, i found myself becoming immersed in the story. maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. listening to songs like "bibbidy-bobbidy-boo" and "a dream is a wish your heart makes" sort of whisked me back to the theme parks. i can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring cinderella castle.<br /><br />something about this movie just evokes the magic of disney. that may make many people scoff, but go to the magic kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what i'm talking about. the images of cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as mickey mouse, winnie the pooh, and tinkerbell - embody why disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world.<br /><br />while "cinderella" may not be the strongest story, it is sort of iconic in disney and movie history. it represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids. i imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many, many people out there. it may not be my favorite disney movie, but it does represent all that i love and admire about the company.<br /><br />my imdb rating: 10/10. my yahoo! grade: a (outstanding)
