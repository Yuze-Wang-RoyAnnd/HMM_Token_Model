have just seen the australian premiere of shower [xizhao] at the sydney film festival. the program notes said it was - a perfect delight -deftly made, touching, amusing, dramatic and poignantly meaningful. i couldn't agree more. i just hope the rest of the festival films come up to this standard of entertainment and i look forward to seeing more chinese films planned to be shown in sydney in the coming months.
