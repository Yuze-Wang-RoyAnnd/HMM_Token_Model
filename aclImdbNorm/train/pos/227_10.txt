robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e. lee, according the imdb.com movie database. after seeing this film, you may think duvall's appearance is reincarnation at it's best. one of my most favorite films. i wish the composer, peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available. wonderful scenery and music and "all too-true-to-life," especially for those of us that live in, or have moved to, the south. this is a "real moment in time." life moves on, slowly, but "strangers we do not remain."
