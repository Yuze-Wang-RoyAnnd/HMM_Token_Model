i had seen this movie when it got released, and when i was 12 years old :) and i still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger :) and the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain! i think many so-called action movies copied a lot many "escape scenes" from this movie!! and not only does it never impress me when i see such copying, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) the lead actors have acted wonderfully. the slow and realistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. as children, we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very natural :) the way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance!! --vijay.
