in the film kongwon-do ui him it features a relatively intimate look into the meaningfulness (as well as general meaninglessness) into the lives of various koreans; empty people seeking ways to fill themselves, enjoying the escapism of nature. from the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters; we learn of their shortcomings and their desires, the overall complexity captured within human life (and yet the overal simplicity of humanity). although the film is slow-moving, it can be very contemplative. it does not force any ideas, but allows the ideas to come about themselves, it allows the concepts to reveal themselves.<br /><br />the film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins, and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness, that love is often an act of selfishness, and the many mistakes that we make. it is a look into everyday life, very well and beautifully done.<br /><br />if you are looking for action or for intense drama, this is not the film for you. however, if you enjoy honest, original, and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz, this is a great film to watch.
