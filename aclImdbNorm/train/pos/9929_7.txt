i doubt much of this film is based on a true story. at the beginning it says based on a true story, sort of. i bet the only truth to it was there was an ex-model turned bounty hunter possibly named domino.<br /><br />anyways, it begins with domino talking to lucy liu, who works for the fbi. domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars. through flashbacks, we see domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter. she basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off, ed and choco. they let her join the group. she's tough, can use any kind of weapon, and will use her good looks if needed.<br /><br />they get involved with a scam that clarmont, a bailsman, has going. along the way, the group starts a reality tv show, and that's where ian zering and brian austin green become involved. they are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this.<br /><br />i thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs. the editing didn't bother me. there's also a lot of violence, mainly using guns, and blood. it could have been a little shorter.<br /><br />final verdict: good enough to watch.
