this is a film that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it doesn't exactly give the viewer easy watching. the story about troubled spike and his friend heaton is not exactly a friday night film yet it has its own unique edge and i found that it was entertaining. there are moments of brilliance given that the film was shot on such a low budget, such as when spike inhales the aerosol. however i did not really understand the relationship between spike and heaton and to be honest it made me spend most of the film trying to work it out. and also i did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much "action". it is a small film that is complex to watch and that is what makes it appealing.
