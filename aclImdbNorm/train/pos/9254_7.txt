no movie with dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner deserves a rating under 5 on here. this is a poor mans version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless midnight run except the prisoner being transported here is the very easy on the eye ms.eleniak. tom berenger plays another gruff, maverick military type well and william mcnamara plays his rookie-about to be discharged foil well. the plot on the face of it is absurd because i lost count of the times eleniak should have and could have escaped but this is an entertaining feel-good movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors that keep the movie rolling. this isn't really a family movie as there is some swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak but this is a lot better than some of the other guff that came out around this time.
