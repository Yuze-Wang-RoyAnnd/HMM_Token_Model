a case of being in the right place at the right time. what a fascinating film. it is easy to see why chavez is so popular with his people. he gets things done. he is accessible. and it is also easy to see why the west hates him so much. he has control of the resources of his country and gives the profits back to the people. mostly the poor. and it easy to see how the tv stations can portray misleading images to put there case. just like the iraq war, or the war on terror. or those missing wmd's. or how about the axis of evil. people need to wake up. and get different points of view. stop the neo cons ruling the world. go watch this movie with an open mind. and make your own mind up. then i suggest you see aaron russo's: america: freedom to fascism. it is not the people of america that are the problem. it is the government.
