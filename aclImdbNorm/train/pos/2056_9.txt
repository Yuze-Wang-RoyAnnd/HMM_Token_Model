i don't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves. i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake, especially for originality. yes the scarecrow is a kung-fu fighting frightner, but why not? no one else is willing to go that far. i really haven't had this much fun watching a movie since candyman. so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow, even his mom doesn't care about him. then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow, who then goes on a killing spree. his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going. the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors, but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool, these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre. over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs, with one liners you'll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick. i would say, grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a$$ off with this movie. i love it for its originality, most fun.
