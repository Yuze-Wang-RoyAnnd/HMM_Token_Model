this movie is so cheap, it's endearing!!! with ron liebmann (major vaughn) providing the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in film history. i own 2 copies of this movie on video...on one, ralph macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at major vaugn while he is ranting at "hash". obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film, but it goes to show just how funny the movie is, when the actors themselves can't keep a straight face!!!
