this movie completely ran laps around the original dolemite. it had everything that makes a movie great..except for real actors. (ernie hudson couldn't do it alone and you know that! lol) i admit that i have killed my first video tape of this movie and i plan to buy the dvd version again as soon as possible! this movie has so many catchy lines it's pitiful! i am embarrassed to say that i know the theme song backwards and forwards! i love jimmy lynch's character to death, and he should have won the best supporting actor award in blaxploitation, but the oscars were never ready for this! this is a random film consisting of crooked cops, breasts, chases, bad editing, and of course martial arts. (being that it's the 70's and i can say everyone knew some kind of martial arts). i think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the midst of a marathon in local theaters!
