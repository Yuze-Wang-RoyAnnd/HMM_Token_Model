i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s. it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation. i'm not sure that squares with the facts.<br /><br />still the film is well done. the german high command reports wryly without emotion "the russians are advancing down the fredrich strasse" as if all went according to plan.<br /><br />it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock-off was based on the british historian trevor-roper's account by a similar title last days of hitler. i was surprised to see no credit to trevor-roper.<br /><br />i agree the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic. the american knock-off was a little flat.<br /><br />few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph. yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler's double alluded to in passing in john toland's magnificent historical piece.<br /><br />was gibs?
