this is an important film. it challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. there's a lot to like here. the director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired cinematic conventions. unlike a lot of recent american cinema, this film takes an interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place. the dvd includes a lot of bonus features, and there are two commentaries that explain the movie for the viewers still befuddled after an initial viewing. when the film screened at sundance, it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry. this is a sunday morning coffee movie, not a friday night party movie. for the dedicated viewer, it's a treasure trove.
