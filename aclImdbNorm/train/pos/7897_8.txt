at first sight this movie doesn't look like a particular great one. after all a bette davis movies with only 166 votes on imdb and a rating of 6,5 must be a rather bad one. but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise.<br /><br />you would at first expect that this is a normal average typical '30's movie with a formulaic love-story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story, which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch.<br /><br />the story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent. their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two. their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love-story that work humorous as well. it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch, that is perfectly entertaining.<br /><br />the movie is quite short (just over an hour long), which means that the story doesn't waste any time on needless plot lines, development and characters. it makes the movie also rather fast paced, which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well. it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun.<br /><br />a delightful pleasant simple romantic-comedy that deserves to be seen by more!<br /><br />8/10
