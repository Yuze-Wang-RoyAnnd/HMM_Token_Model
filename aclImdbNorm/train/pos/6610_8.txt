in 2054 paris, avalon, a computer generated system, controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped, detective karas (craig) must go against avalon to find her.<br /><br />renaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking manor with a noir themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many.<br /><br />pixar are the animation masters. their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the mystifying wall-e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their perch. renaissance isn't a film aimed for the young audience though, and like 2007's persepolis, brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generation.<br /><br />in 2005 robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that shook up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd spurts of colour and a year later, christian volckman took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film making.<br /><br />volckman's picture however is a full on animation but it doesn't half look realistic for the majority of it's strong 1 hour and 40 minutes of running time. the faces of the character's are well portrayed and in particular, this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow. the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply gazing into the stony faces as the shadows blend across their expressions. it is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy, and is finely directed also.<br /><br />for anyone who has seen persepolis you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style by marjane satrapi<br /><br />renaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood. one scene in particular when karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shot.<br /><br />the narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen. the running of paris is down to the mysterious avalon which we don't see nearly enough to get an essence of its true dominance. renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cop's attempts to rescue the mysterious woman, and then we see craig's tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements. there are many things wrong with the scripting, not to mention the tired exasperated cop routine is now old, but there is plenty of dashing adrenaline and springy banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages.
