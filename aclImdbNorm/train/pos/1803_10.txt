my dog recently passed away, and this was a movie i loved as a kid, so i had to see it to try to cheer up.<br /><br />(beware of dog, i mean spoilers.) this movie isn't just for kids and it's far from ordinary. it was set in new orleans in 1939. first and foremost, the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this film, but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with.<br /><br />in the beginning, charlie is not too different from his dishonest and brutal business partner, carface. he is money driven, greedy, and just escaped death row, as he states in the start of the feature. the difference between charlie and carface is that charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others; anne marie and his sidekick, itchy. carface will not even listen to the fat, ugly dog with the big glasses who happens to be closest to him.<br /><br />carface attempts to murder the hero, because he wants 100% of the profits in their business and won't settle for only 50% - a highly unusual way for a german shepherd mix to die. also, being eaten by a prehistoric sized alligator who ends up sparing your life because you can sing is highly unlikely whether you are a dog or not. this is a cartoon, and that's why it is logical here.<br /><br />carface's method of revenge is through murder, while charlie believes success is the best revenge, financial success that is. after surviving death, he starts a business by taking carface's source of financing, a highly talented girl who possesses the ability to communicate with animals. they win a whole bunch of races, and charlie tells her he'll give the money to the poor - hint hint: charlie and itchy live in a junkyard, and are therefore poor. he uses the money toward his casino/bar/theatre, and not the other "poor." the reason why anne marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion, and she listens carefully. she teaches charlie ethics by pointing out his gambling, lying, and stealing. charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses. she added the ethics that his business needed, while charlie did management, and itchy provided construction.<br /><br />carface uses violence and property damage to tear down charlie's business, which is unprotected by the government. charlie loses everything and all he has left is this little girl. in the end he had to choose between her life and his own. he first grabs the watch out of self preservation, and sets it down when the girl started to sink. both the girl and the watch were sinking, and he had to choose which one, and he chose the girl.<br /><br />the great part about this movie that focuses on a person's ability to learn right from wrong over time, and a child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of death of their pet, is that it never shows anyone dying! the watch symbolizes his life, and the watch is shown being submerged and stopped. all the deaths were suggestive, even for the villain. i didn't cry during this movie until now, and i have gotten so much more out of it, that i had to write it down and share it with you.
