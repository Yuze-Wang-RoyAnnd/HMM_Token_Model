dream quest was a surprisingly good movie. there were some noticeable goofs, but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time. i did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and i found it pretty entertaining. it gets kind of silly at times, but overall i recommend it. they probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores, and some of the costume designs were pretty good.
