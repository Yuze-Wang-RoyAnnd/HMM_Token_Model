one of the more sensible comedies to hit the hindi film screens. a remake of priyadarshans 80s malayalam hit boeing boeing, which in turn was a remake of the 60s hollywoon hit of the same name, garam masala elevates the standard of comedies in hindi cinema.<br /><br />akshay kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of hindi cinema who can do comedy. he has combined well with the new hunk john abraham. however john still remains in akshays shadows and fails to rise to the occasion.<br /><br />the new gals are cute and do complete justice to their roles.<br /><br />a must watch comedy. leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hrs!!!! after all laughter is the best medicine ! ask priyadarshan and akshay kumar !!!!!
