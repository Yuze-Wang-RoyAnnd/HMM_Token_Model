the good earth is a great movie!!!everybody must see...it is tear-jerking and very heart warming. it caters to the enhancement of values-formation on perseverance, humility and the love of family...the story can be related to our life today especially that poverty is at the threshold. the way on how we respond to such problem is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to face such, he may be left defenseless and useless. i am very pleased on how the characters justified their roles even the young actors...their emotions has captivated the audience. the movie may have been done in black and white, but the story is so captivating that you do not want to end. that makes it really great! there should be a re-make for this very nice movie.
