don't mistake "war inc." for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs. it isn't.<br /><br />this is an old-fashioned screwball comedy, with ridiculously coincidental plot twists, stock characters (given some depth in fun performances by john cusack, joan cusack, marisa tomei and hillary duff) and a straightforward approach to the political content.<br /><br />you see, the filmmakers' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true. yeah, we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt, inept pigs, the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons, and american imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now -- but none of that is the point.<br /><br />here, all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon -- sometimes in genius ways -- as the backdrop for a silly romp, as john cusack's character (the hit-man with a heart) tries to change his life with the help of the do-gooder journalist who doesn't trust him (tomei) and the young middle eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage (duff). cusack's sister, joan, plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality. ben kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless cia boss.<br /><br />that's all, and it works. it's simple fun, but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there's no corruption and people in the middle east wish our western culture would supplant theirs, then you might not find it as funny.<br /><br />for all the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political edge.
