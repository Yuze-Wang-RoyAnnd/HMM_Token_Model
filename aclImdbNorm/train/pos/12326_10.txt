i saw this movie first on the berlin film festival, and i had never seen hong kong cinema before. i felt like sitting in a roller coaster: the action was so quick, and there wasn't one boring moment throughout the film. it has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. my favorite scene is when the taoist drinks, sings and fights for himself - one of the many scenes which stress the extraordinary musical component of the movie. this film is a definite must!!
