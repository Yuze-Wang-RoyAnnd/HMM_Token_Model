as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years, whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions, it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other. that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge, merchant and money lender in 19th century london.<br /><br />as his nephew points out to his uncle, he doesn't keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug. the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago, he's a hard case, a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart, mr. potter of bedford falls, new york.<br /><br />but as charles dickens told this tale, redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him how.<br /><br />a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was. the characters in this film are middle and lower class. the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist, but they are having to struggle to stay up there. still love and happiness radiate their home, no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for. <br /><br />like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much, ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world.<br /><br />patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge. but george c. scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film. the meanness of him, but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change. scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who've both done great interpretations of scrooge.<br /><br />among the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present. <br /><br />according to imdb this is one of 32 versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best.
