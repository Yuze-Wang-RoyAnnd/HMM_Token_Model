this is a really cool movie! i remember first seeing it when i was really young and i used to watch it all the time like once a week...shadow was my favorite character in the movie. homeward bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things. parts of the movie are sad though (such as when sassy, the cat, falls down the waterfall, and when shadow falls in the hole at the end.) i have seen the second homeward bound but i gotta say its not as good as the first. shadow is the smart one, sassy is, well, sassy, and chance is the funny idiot. i recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies, or talking animals. this is one of my top ten favorite movies!
