this picture for me scores very highly as it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of alien invaders taking over a town and many of its' men folk.<br /><br />the town and the players are all decked out in sort of 1950's style and the whole movie has a deliberate tacky and kitschy feel to it. some of the scenes are hilarious like with the birth of an alien creature.<br /><br />all the actors give full blooded and serious performances which makes the film even funnier and the special effects and aliens are at least it seems to me intentionally 3rd rate to add to the amusement.<br /><br />these type of films often deserve a cult following:<br /><br />8/10.
