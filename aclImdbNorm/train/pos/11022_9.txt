forget credibility<br /><br />you must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats, being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed, and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons... especially when renny harlin is directing.<br /><br />"cliffhanger " is no exception. but the movie has numerous assets : breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed, stunning special and visual effects ( the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film ), excellent musical score, welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension, and a solid cast : two heroes ( stallone, star and cowriter, has the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent michael rooker more than stands his ground ), a charming heroin ( janine turner ), and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever ( priceless john lithgow and deceivingly feminine caroline goodall, but also rex linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it, leon, craig fairbrass ) good, solid entertainment then , if no credibility.as roger ebert wrote ( about another film )"it's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much."<br /><br />
