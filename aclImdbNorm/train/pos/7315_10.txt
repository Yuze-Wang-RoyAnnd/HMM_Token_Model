classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director carpenter and star curtis.<br /><br />seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on halloween.<br /><br />halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! the direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling, that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! plus, he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. highest kudos also go to carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score. in a sense, halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!<br /><br />the cast is excellent. young jamie lee curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter laurie strode, she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. the great donald pleasants does a perfect performance as a myer's doctor, who's desperate to capture him again. supporting cast loomis, soles, castle, and others are good too.<br /><br />so like its own villain, halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. it is a must for all genre fans!<br /><br />**** out of ****
