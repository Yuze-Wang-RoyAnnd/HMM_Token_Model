this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in. john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece. brilliant performances by the whole cast, but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star's career.<br /><br />however, as a college student myself, many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme. in a sense that, while they are issues faced on many college campuses, they aren't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe. in some instances, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur. however, aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to talk, just think. one of the things from this picture i will remember forever, was a quote from lawrence fishburn's character, "knowledge is power, without knowledge, you cannot see your power." brilliant, just brilliant.
