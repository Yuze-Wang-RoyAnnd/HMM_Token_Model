deranged and graphically gory japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg-zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser. in the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected.<br /><br />technically superb horror comedy(?) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying. good taste prevents me from describing what happens here, but lets just say its pretty gruesome. if you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film. personally i'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level. here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to people i know who like really gory movies.. its also a film with enough going on in the details that i want to see it again since now that i know what was going on-as revealed in the end-i want to go back and see what it was i didn't catch on to. there is an internal logic rare in these films.<br /><br />7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs, its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else.
