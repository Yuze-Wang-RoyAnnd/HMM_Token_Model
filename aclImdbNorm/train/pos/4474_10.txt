this film (like astaire's royal wedding - which was shown after it on turner classic network last night) is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in gene kelly's record: like fred astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a room's walls and ceiling, this film had gene kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with jerry mouse. the sequence is nicely done. what is forgotten is that kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to dean stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day, and sets the stage for the sequence by having stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background. kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white "pomeranian" navy uniform with blue stripes on it. jerry mouse does more than dance with gene. he actually talks - a first that he did not repeat for many decades. he also finally puts tom cat into his proper place - tom briefly appears as king jerry's butler, trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses.<br /><br />but the sequence of the cartoon with kelly took about seven minutes of the movie. far more of this peculiar film is taken up with kelly's story of the lost four day furlough in hollywood, and how kelly ends up meeting katherine grayson and (with frank sinatra) stalking jose iturbi at the mgm film studio, the hollywood bowl, and iturbi's own home. except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing.<br /><br />kelly has saved sinatra's life in the pacific, and is getting a medal as a result. they are both among the crewmen back in california who are getting a four day leave. but the script writers (to propel what would be a short film - kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one "lola", an unseen good time girl in hollywood) saddle gene with frank. <br /><br />it seems frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories (particularly musical comedies) who are socially underdeveloped and in need of "instruction" about meeting girls (or guys if the characters are women). frank insists that gene help "teach him" how to get a girl. just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy (stockwell) who insists on joining the navy (and won't give the cops his real name and address). when a protesting kelly is able to get this information out of stockwell by asking him some straight questions (which the cops could not ask), they insist kelly take the boy home to his aunt (grayson). still protesting, kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems (mostly due to sinatra's simplistic soul view of things). he misses seeing lola the next day by sleeping late - sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up. he keeps getting dragged back to grayson's house, as sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself, but needs kelly to train him in love making.<br /><br />i suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of anchors aweigh, but i find this kind of story irritating. while the singing and dancing and concert music of kelly, sinatra, grayson, and iturbi are first rate, it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like sinatra's character seriously. in the real world kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough - what right has he to insist (as sinatra does) that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date? that kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me - unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense.<br /><br />the stalking of iturbi is likewise annoying. kelly tries to get grayson to like sinatra when he says sinatra can get her a meeting with jose iturbi to audition her singing ability. for much of the rest of the picture sinatra and kelly try to do that, and keep floundering (at one point - for no really good reason - grayson herself ruins kelly's attempt to get an interview at mgm with iturbi). it is only sheer luck (that iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed grayson) that she does give him an audition of her talent. <br /><br />kelly, by the way, ends up with grayson. sinatra's conscience at not being able to help her see iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her (but not pulling kelly into it, oddly enough) and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress (pamela britton) from his native brooklyn. and naturally, without any assistance from kelly, sinatra and britton fall in love. ah,"consistency"! thy name is not "screenwriting" necessarily!
