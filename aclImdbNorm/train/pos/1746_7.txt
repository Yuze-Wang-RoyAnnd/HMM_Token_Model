bela lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit (which was also the source of a feature film where lugosi played the villain.) lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way. here chandu returns from the east in order to help the princess nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult. this is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun. to be certain the pacing is a bit slack, more akin to one of principals (the producing studios) features then a rip roaring adventure, but it's still enjoyable. this plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that "hey i missed something". one of the trilogy of three good serials lugosi made, the others being sos coast guard and phantom creeps
