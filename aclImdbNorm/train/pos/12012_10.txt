i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning. i'm going to assume that one's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one's level of acceptance of joseph's story.<br /><br />however, that aside it was very well made, well acted, and had a nice score. if you get to salt lake city, it is a must to see it in the legacy theater. i have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality, sound quality and ambiance in my entire life...i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there! being that i'm lds and regard joseph as a prophet, i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times...which i presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started! anyway, i'm told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe, if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
