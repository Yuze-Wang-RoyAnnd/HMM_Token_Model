one the whole, this movie isn't perfect. it doesn't 'hang well' together as the story line is basically a bunch of hooks to hang jokes.<br /><br />some of these jokes are a little 'too 80s' and tend to date the picture.<br /><br />but some of these jokes are classic.<br /><br />you know a movie has something special when you and your friends still reference silly quotes from it over 2 decades later.<br /><br />plus, there are a bunch of familiar faces; michael keaton, danny devito, joe piscapo, peter boyle, marilu henner, maureen stapleton, bob eubanks, griffin dunne, and one of the last roles of alan hale jr., the skipper from gilligan's island.<br /><br />also, there are some great absurdist moments, like when johnny is labelling the puppies with a pricing gun, or the pope making an appearance in johnny's neighborhood. also, the scene where the fake priest makes up a lot of words in latin is excellent. ("summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio's too louda... post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian").<br /><br />other classic scenes include ramone maroney butchering the english language danny devito urging griffin dunne to 'play ball' peter boyle thinking he lost his manhood the fake vd movie<br /><br />this movie is no home run. but like 'porky's', it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable.
