this movie is stuffed full of stock horror movie goodies: chained lunatics, pre-meditated murder, a mad (vaguely lesbian) female scientist with an even madder father who wears a mask because of his horrible disfigurement, poisoning, spooky castles, werewolves (male and female), adultery, slain lovers, tibetan mystics, the half-man/half-plant victim of some unnamed experiment, grave robbing, mind control, walled up bodies, a car crash on a lonely road, electrocution, knights in armour - the lot, all topped off with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst foley work ever done.<br /><br />the script is incomprehensible (even by badly dubbed spanish horror movie standards) and some of the editing is just bizarre. in one scene where the lead female evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly dubbed: "that is fantastical. i do not understand. explain to me again how this is..." exposition scenes that litter this movie, there is a sudden hand held cutaway of the girl's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than to cover a cut in the bad scientist's "mwahaha! all your werewolfs belong mine!" speech. though why they went to the bother i don't know because there are plenty of other jarring jump cuts all over the place - even allowing for the atrocious pan and scan of the print i saw.<br /><br />the director was, according to one interview with the star, drunk for most of the shoot and the film looks like it. it is an incoherent mess. it's made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film the mark of the wolf man (made 4 years earlier, featuring the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make up - is there a word in spanish for "continuity"?) and more padding of another actor in the wolfman get-up ambling about in long shot.<br /><br />the music is incredibly bad varying almost at random from full orchestral creepy house music, to bosannova, to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded. (thinking about it, it might not have been a duet. it might have been a solo. the piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the gong with the other.) <br /><br />this is one of the most bewilderedly trance-state inducing bad movies of the year so far for me. enjoy.<br /><br />favourite line: "ilona! this madness and perversity will turn against you!" how true.<br /><br />favourite shot: the lover, discovering his girlfriend slain, dropping the candle in a cartoon-like demonstration of surprise. rank amateur directing there.
