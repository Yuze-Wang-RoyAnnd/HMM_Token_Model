best stephen king film alongside it, though this one is more fun than scary. <br /><br />this one's got it all: <br /><br />-a great cast with a alice krige and brian krause and a fun cameo from king himself;<br /><br />-well dosed horror in an amusing storyline;<br /><br />-great use of music, santo & johnny's "sleepwalk" in particular;<br /><br />-likeable characters in a typical king setting: middle of nowhere village;<br /><br />-lots of humor. you can't really get good scares here because it's too much fun and over the top;<br /><br />-old but really nice makeup effects like they don't make anymore!<br /><br />a 4,5 rating: i don't get it really. when was the last time a horror film was as much fun as this one?
