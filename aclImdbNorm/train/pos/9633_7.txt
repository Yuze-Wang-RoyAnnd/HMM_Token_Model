in many ways dirty work is a predictable l&h short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone`s chimney . guess what happens next ? that`s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues .<br /><br />but there`s one or two things that seem untypical . ollie for example is very unlikable , he`s arrogant , he`s rude , and not only to stan look at the way he addresses the servant with " hey you " and takes a childish huff very easily with his catchphrase being " i have nothing to say " . in short ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and i much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where he`s always at his funniest<br /><br />dirty work also lacks the reportary regulars of the other l&h shorts like finlayson , long , busch and housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline there`s a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie <br /><br />having said that this is still a good short mainly down to stan . also watch out for a scene featuring a fish . many jokes/plots from l&h feature fish and this is another one
