i wasn't sure when i heard about this coming out. i was thinking how dumb is disney getting. i was wrong. i found it to be very good. i mean it's not the lion king but it's cool to see another side from a certain point. it was very funny. also it wasn't one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks, it was just like the lion king animation. the only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie. not to give anything way but you'll know what i am talking about. i also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return. it was a very good movie over all.
