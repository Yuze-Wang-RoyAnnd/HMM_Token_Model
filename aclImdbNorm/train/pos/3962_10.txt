marvelous james stewart, vera miles vehicle. what makes this historical film dealing with the fbi so good is the family element that is involved during a 35 year career as depicted by stewart in the film.<br /><br />the film shows a history of the great investigatory agency. it deals with airplane bomb plots, killing off of indians in oklahoma for real estate gain, fighting organized crime, nazis and communists in that order. the human element is never far behind as stewart weds vera miles. they raise 3 children as miles' heart goes out each time stewart goes out on assignment.<br /><br />look for a brief but memorable performance by murray hamilton. years later, he appeared as mr. robinson in 1967's "the graduate."<br /><br />the film has nothing but praise for j. edgar hoover. he certainly brought the fbi up to par.<br /><br />true, this could be viewed as right-wing propaganda, especially with stewart's real-life republican views, but it's well done, historically informative, and the view of the family so well depicted.
