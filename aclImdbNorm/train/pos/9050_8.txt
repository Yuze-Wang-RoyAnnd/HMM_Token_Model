this is a gem, a real piece of americana for all that this implies. if you are self programed to resist "life-afirming" stories, just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe. and what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story, no need to nit-pick what details were changed to make a compact story. chris cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, self-conflicted, bottom-line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight. the simple minded comments, refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off-track, expose the limitation of the commentator, not the writers or the acting. this is not for the cynical, or the simple minded.
