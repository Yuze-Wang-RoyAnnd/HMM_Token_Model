yeah sure it's cheesy, it's not zombie, but it's not that bad either. it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus, and it's entertaining. i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience, as he was never completely satisfied with it. it is well worth a search out, especially for genre and fulci fans. it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand.
