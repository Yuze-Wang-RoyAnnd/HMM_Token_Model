while rome goes mad celebrating hitler's visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two outsiders stay home, in a large building, and wind up meeting. she is sofia loren, who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children. he is mastroianni, a radio speaker who's been fired because of his homosexuality. both of them need company and understanding, both f them find it in each other.<br /><br />the movie covers a span of a few hours. the color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers. strangely enough, the nazi anthem - the horst-wessel-lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme.<br /><br />beautiful movie, excellent recreation of a special era in italian history and a touching, sad story. mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and sofia loren does a superb job, very far away from her usual truck driver's pin-up, neapolitan fishwife personas. don't miss it.
