netflix should mention this short feature on the info for silk stockings. superior in every way to that over-produced fluff. this had much better cole porter songs and lots more energy. silk stockings turned out to be a big disappointment. fred was getting too old for this sort of thing, though the dances and cyd are lovely. i will be on the watch for the garbo--melvyn douglas version of ninotchka. was peter lorre ill during the making of silk stockings--he seems to be very passive in the more active numbers and with less lines? very glad that i ran across paree--paree by pure accident. made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable. bob hope, as a simple "song and dance man' is pure joy.
