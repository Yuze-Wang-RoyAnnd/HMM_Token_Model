god bless 80's slasher films. this is a fun, fun movie. this is what slasher films are all about. now i'm not saying horror movies, just slasher films. it goes like this: a high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders, and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong. disfigured and back for revenge, sporting a joker/jester mask (pretty creepy looking, might i add), marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later, after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion. that is basically the plot? what's wrong with that? that's the beauty of 80's slasher films, most of them i would say. a lot of things could be so ridiculous, but they keep drawing you more in an' in as they go by. especially this film.<br /><br />it features some outrageous killings, and some are quite creative as well. (poisoning of a beer can, acid bath, i can't remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film either)it really is a fun, fun movie. that's all it is. nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots, never mind their stupidity, and never mind the outrageous, random things that occur in this film. such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer (when he's not even switching any buttons, you'll see) and toilets being able to cough up blood, baths being able to have acid come out of them, just use that as part of your entertainment! because thats what really makes it entertaining.<br /><br />movies like this represent 80's slashers. never again could movies like this get made, know why? it isn't the 80's anymore. that is why you should just cherish them for what they are, good fun! i highly recommend this film if you're a hardcore fan of slahsers such as friday the 13th.<br /><br />one last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well, marty rantzen. a disfigured, nerd, who kills all his old foes in a creepy jester mask. a good villain makes a good slasher. simon scuddamore, who played marty apparently committed suicide shortly after slaughter high was released. that alone adds something creepy to the film, and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the marty character, i guess. all in all, great 80's slashers fun! it's a shame it will never be the same again...
