"bye bye birdie" isn't one of the best musicals of all time, but it's great fun, and accessible to many audiences. the original film could have been wonderful, with dick van dyke reprising his signature broadway role, but instead they tinkered with the plot, so the film is very unsatisfying. this re-make, which aired on abc in 1995, is far more faithful to the original script, and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred tommy tune and ann reinking (who choreographed this film.)<br /><br />jason alexander is a very different type from dick van dyke, but he is well cast as albert, (before his "seinfeld" days, he started in musical theater.) vanessa williams is a perfect fit for rose. their is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie ( a role he played on the national tour).<br /><br />this film is not without it's problems though. a major liability is chynna phillips, who, however appealing, simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim. and george wendt is somewhat bland as her father, somewhat throwing the number "kids" away (a number original cast member paul lynde stole the show with.)<br /><br />but all in all, this is a delightful, well-done film which the material deserved.
