i can watch b,b&c and feel all the emotions i felt when i first saw it at aged 18 well,maybe all but one.certainly miss k.novak has lost none of her silky allure in nearly half a century.she was a thinking youth's diana dors.all those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart - clutching,collar - tightening,blood - pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good. now,huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a hoodie,they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the video shop,relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple - locked comparative safety of their fourth - floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal. this movie is miss novak's golden moment.she seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex - appeal and,despite all this,she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence. she completely dominates the amiable mr j.stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie.misses e.lanchester and h.gingold offer comic relief along with mr e. kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed.mr j.lemmon plays miss novak's brother.he is a beatnik,a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream.some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later.certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and mr lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one. but all else is mere frippery,miss novak - bathed in a particularly beautiful spectrum of technicolor - is the sole raison - d'etre for "bell,book and candle".it survives,its reputation enhanced,as the ultimate showcase for one of hollywood's most beautiful women. loved by moviegoers,ignored by critics,miss novak will continue to captivate with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the "play" buttons on their dvds.one day,probably after we are all gone,she will be discovered by a new generation who will - belatedly - realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully - dressed and sexually attractive at the same time.
