i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie. i thought the writer - sue smith - very clearly summarised what the film was about. however, the movie really didn't need explanation. i thought the themes were abundantly clear, and inspiring. a movie which deals with the the ability to dare, to face fear - especially fear passed down from parental figures - and overcome it and, in doing so, embrace life's possibilities, is a film to be treasured and savoured. i enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped 'somersault.' i also think mandy62 was a bit unkind to hugo weaving. as a bloke about his vintage, i should look so good! i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently, but 'peaches' delivers the goods. i'm glad i saw it.
