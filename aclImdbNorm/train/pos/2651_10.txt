that's right. the movie is better than the book. don't get me wrong, i love the book. but the movie is just so much better. this film has jack nicholson and shelly duvall at their best. (i haven't seen scatman crothers and obviously danny lloyd in anything else.) some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book. but i already talked about those in my comment on the mini series. but, i missed a few. the film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot. and the redrum scenes are creepier than those in the book. so if you're looking for a great movie, get stanley kubrick's the shining. but count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks
