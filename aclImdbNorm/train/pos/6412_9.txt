i'm certainly glad that a film was made about carl brashear's amazing life story. coming as it did during the civil rights era, brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected.<br /><br />brashear as played by cuba gooding, jr. leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen. very similar to jackie robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct. as brashear, gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father carl lumbly has and lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he's gotten.<br /><br />but while harry truman integrated the armed services after world war ii, the navy still has its restrictions. a black man can only be a cook or an officer's valet, the real fighting parts are denied him. that's not good enough for gooding who applies to become a navy deep sea diver.<br /><br />once at the diving school at bayonne, new jersey, gooding gets it all thrown at him, mostly by the master chief petty officer in charge, robert deniro. deniro may have some leftover prejudices, but he's nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide.<br /><br />the best thing about men of honor is the chemistry between deniro and gooding. they certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, both turn out to be men of honor.<br /><br />other good performances to note are charlize theron as deniro's wife and hal holbrook as the head of the diving school, a guy the navy just wish would retire for reasons you'll see.<br /><br />men of honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.
