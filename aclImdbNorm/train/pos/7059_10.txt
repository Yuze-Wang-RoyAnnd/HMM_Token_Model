i was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews i saw on the web, i thought cinderella 2 (as well as 3) is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone - kids and adults...like me, i am 22 years old.<br /><br />i also find it and very informative film, it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart. i thought it has great animation, and the voice casting was very good; the songs performed by brooke allison too. since this film has been divided into three flashbacks/stories, my favorite out of the three, is the story of when jaq the mouse, became a human for a day, thanks to fairy godmother and her magic.
