cor blimey. this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece. billy zane is stunning as the central character, and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy.<br /><br />the soundtrack is really good, and the set pieces are a joy to behold. i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates, a few bottles of your liquor of choice, and prepare to be astonished and highly entertained.<br /><br />this carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan 9 from outer space that it is in the true "b" movie tradition. but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. ron pearlman for example. i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. all a bit mad, and all the better for it.
