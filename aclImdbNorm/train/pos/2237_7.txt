it was considered to be the "swiss answer to the lord of the rings", but it is much more than that. it isn't an answer to anything, it's in itself something new, something funny and sometimes it's downright stupid and silly - but was monty python any different than silly?<br /><br />the beginning immediately makes the statement that this film is low budget and not meant to be taken entirely seriously. cardboard clouds on strings knock into the airplane in which the main character is seated. but, to compensate the missing special effects, the landscape does the trick. it is absolutely beautiful and stunning - who needs new zealand, switzerland has it all. <br /><br />what i liked about the film was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy that went into it. it isn't brilliant; yet it's got some good humorous parts. edward piccin as friedo is absolutely convincing, it would be enough to go and see the film because of him!there are some good jokes, some of them are very lame, some of them won't be understood by people outside of switzerland. i liked the idea of having "urucows" instead of uruk hai; i loved the scene where friedo decides to take "pupsi", a telehobbie, with him on the journey. also very funny is the scene when rackaroll, the sword-fighting knight, decides to show off with his sword - and subsequently smashes it into a wall, breaking it. and there is this one scene where the "nazgul-ish" characters do a wonderfully comic scene that includes a toilet brush... i didn't approve of the idea of the ring being used by schleimli, the "gollum" character, in order to "seduce" the ladies. that was a bit far fetched. the idea of lord sauraus wanting to cover the lands with fondue wasn't that brilliant either. original, certainly, but not brilliant. but most of all did i dislike the idea of a gay dragon, that really wasn't necessary. all in all i recommend to see the film simply because it is so crazy and totally trashy. don't expect a lotr parody like "spaceballs" was for star wars. but if you go to the flicks thinking that this is going to be an amusing evening out, with absolutely no ambitions, then you'll enjoy. i am not sure if it works in other languages, because it does live from the swiss dialects as well as from the jokes and actors.<br /><br />all in all: hat off to the courage of the swiss crew who did that!
