this film has a lot of raw potential. the script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice-overs), the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good, though some of the experimentation just doesn't work. the main problem here is david duchovny. once a geek-boy, always a geek-boy; and the sad, simple fact is that he's incapable of playing anything but fox mulder. he postures, he tries to be slick, he poses, he tries to be macho. in the end he just tries too hard. he overplays his character, he overspeaks his lines, and he's just outplayed in all ways by timothy hutton and angelina jolie, who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill. timothy hutton was (as always) really good. there was a spotty moment or two where he over-dramatized his role, but you could tell he was having fun with it. he looked the part, and he became the character both physically and atmospherically. angelina jolie was also really good. she didn't have much of a role; in fact, i though she could have used a much stronger one...her character wasn't nearly developed enough, though she did remarkably well with what she had. and the chemistry between her and hutton was apparent (gee, maybe that's why uma left him...;) all in all, it was rough around the edges, but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles. if david duchovny hadn't ripped his role to pieces it would've been *that* much better. 7/10.
