although i bought the dvd when it first came out, and have watched it several times, i never wrote a review.<br /><br />i loved it when i first saw it and i love it still.<br /><br />sadly, it seems it never made enough money to motivate anyone to do a follow-up. i have to assume qt still controls the rights, but after kill bill if he does a film that is as true to the comics and books as my name is modesty, with another tough female lead, anyone not familiar with the character will see this as a let-down.<br /><br />peter o'donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense rather than action thrillers.<br /><br />the tug of wills between modesty and miklos is very true to the source material and is tense, suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesn't have to have gore and explosions. alexandra did a great job in playing how o'donnell's character would have taken control of the situation.<br /><br />i find this particularly ahead of the curve following the sorely needed reboots of batman and james bond. after 2 dismal earlier efforts, although not nearly as well known to the public, this is really a reboot of the modesty character, and it is really sad that probably no more films about her will be made.
