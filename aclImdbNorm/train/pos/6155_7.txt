"bedknobs and broomsticks" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, despite not being one of the best disney works. it has a generally good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and lovely landscapes of england.<br /><br />it also combines very well live-action and animation. the animation itself is, of course, pretty good. the animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film "robin hood" and the same can be said about the animated characters: there are plenty of wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like in "robin hood". besides, the king (a lion) seems to be a mix of prince john and king richard, not to mention that the bear does look like little john.<br /><br />this movie is often compared to "mary poppins" with a reason. both combine live-action and animation with a similar artwork. both have similar settings in london. both have their own magic and a magical woman. the kids (carrie, charlie and cute little paul) are a bit like the banks children. both movies were directed by robert stevenson and both cast david tomlinson. however, instead of a very serious man like george banks, david tomlinson plays a merrier and magical man - professor emelius browne. with its magic, this movie has also some slight but significant similarities to harry potter's stories.<br /><br />the majority of the songs are good. "the age of not believing" and "the beautiful briny sea" are the very best. "portobello road" is nice too.<br /><br />david tomlinson is great in this film once again. angela lansbury is great as miss price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too: cindy o'callaghan as carrie, ian weighill as charlie (a boy in <<the age of not believing>>) and roy snart as the youngest brother paul.<br /><br />i like the black cat. it's pretty cool. it looks a bit like salem, the black cat from the tv series "sabrina, the teenage witch". i find cute whenever one of the movie's characters is transformed into a white rabbit. rabbits are really cute, fluffy and adorable animals. i just love them! even funnier is whenever professor emelius browne is transformed into a white rabbit because, when he's transformed in human again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. it's really hilarious, combined with his comical figure and that mustache.<br /><br />overall, this is an okay movie, but its ending is quite bad. the first minutes of the movie are nothing special, but then it improves a lot. the ending, however, is weak. that's my major criticism about it, in great part because the animated knights thing is a little too much for me and also due to the war feeling.
