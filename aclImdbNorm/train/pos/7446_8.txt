i can't agree with any of the comments. first time i saw the film on a uk tv channel, it was presented as an indie film and if you take the film under this angle i think it's an all different matter. i couldn't believe what i was seeing and got hooked instantly. the plot may be as bad as a js's show (ie there is no plot) but the acting is wicked, it's hilarious and it's all in all an incredible trash movie. <br /><br />it says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the us society, and more precisely on what afternoon tv viewers in america (and i believe there are plenty of them !) are interested in. after all it's the neighbours we're talking about, don't we ?<br /><br />100% fun !
