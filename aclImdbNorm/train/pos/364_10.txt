steven speilberg's adaptation of alice walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy. when first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men, while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women.<br /><br />this is the story of a young black woman named celie, growing up in rural america after the turn of the century. she has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth. her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister.<br /><br />celie (played in later years by newcomer whoopie goldberg) is married off to an abusive husband (danny glover). the husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from celie's life.<br /><br />the story is often heartbreaking as celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children. throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters, including sophia, a tough as nails wife to her step son, and shug, a loud and luscious saloon singer, who teaches her a thing or two about love.<br /><br />speilberg's direction is all over this picture, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances. i dare you to watch this film and not be moved! the film the color purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story. while it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the african story, both of which were so vivid in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, allowing the voice of alice walker to shine through.<br /><br />i couldn't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film. suffice it to say, however, this is one of the few films that i can watch again and again, and which has left an indelible mark on me.<br /><br />
