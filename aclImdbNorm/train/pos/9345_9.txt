alan johnson (don cheadle) is a successful dentist, who shares his practice with other business partners. alan also has an loving wife (jada pinkett smith) and he has two daughter (camille lache smith & imani hakim). he also let his parents stay in his huge apartment in new york city. but somehow, he feels that his life is somewhat empty. one ordinary day in the city, he sees his old college roommate charlie fireman (adam sandler). which alan hasn't seen charlie in years. when alan tries to befriends with charlie again. charlie is a lonely depressed man, who hides his true feelings from people who cares for him. since charlie unexpectedly loses his family in a plane crash, they were on one of the planes of september 11, 2001. when alan nearly feels comfortable with charlie. when alan mentions things of his past, charlie turns violent towards alan or anyone who mentions his deceased family. now alan tries to help charlie and tries to make his life a little easier for himself. but alan finds out making charlie talking about his true feelings is more difficult than expected.<br /><br />written and directed by mike bender (blankman, indian summer, the upside of anger) made an wonderfully touching human drama that moments of sadness, truth and comedy as well. sandler offers an impressive dramatic performance, which sandler offers more in his dramatic role than he did on paul thomas anderson's punch-drunk love. cheadle is excellent as usual. pinkett smith is fine as alan's supportive wife, liv tyler is also good as the young psychiatrist and saffron burrows is quite good as the beautiful odd lonely woman, who has a wild crush on alan. this film was sadly an box office disappointment, despite it had some great reviews. the cast are first-rate here, the writing & director is wonderful and russ t. alsobrook's terrific widescreen cinematography. the movie has great nyc locations, which the film makes new york a beautiful city to look at in the picture.<br /><br />dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd also an jam session with sandler & cheadle, an featurette, photo montage and previews. i was expecting more for the dvd features like an audio commentary track by the director and deleted scenes. "reign over me" is certainly one of the best films that came out this year. i am sure, this movie looked great in the big screen. which sadly, i haven't had a chance to see it in a theater. but it is also the kind of movie that plays well on dvd. the film has an good soundtrack as well and it has plenty of familiar faces in supporting roles and bit-parts. even the director has a bit-part as byran sugarman, who's an actor himself. "reign over me" is one of the most underrated pictures of this year. it is also the best sandler film in my taste since "the wedding singer". don't miss it. hd widescreen. (**** 1/2 out of *****).
