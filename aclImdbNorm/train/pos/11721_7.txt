the magnetism radiated from elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. with her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. as an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. as initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. she symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. the other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. in the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. the end result is that while elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. fortunately, i have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer.<br /><br />best quote: bob redding: how's your head? elvira: i haven't had any complaints.
