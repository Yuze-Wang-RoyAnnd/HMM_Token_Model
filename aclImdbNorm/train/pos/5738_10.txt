i just purchased and viewed the dvd of this film. the dvd transfer is from last year, 2001. this 1988 film is really a great little film. overlooked by most people. i saw it in the theater in 1988 and have loved it ever since. i love the opening shot of pittsburgh (not baltimore, as another user commented). makes pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! and i must say, the tour of pitts on the garbage truck with nicky is a very scenic, interesting one! tom hulce, as everyone else has said, gives a remarkable, wonderful performance. the dvd is a good transfer, with no extras, but a widescreen format. i recommend it to those who love the movie.
