this is the first must see film i've seen in the last year! it's wickedly funny, incredibly original, unbelievably great looking (they went for this super cool wide-screen technicolor look that's awesome to behold,) and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society. it's really smart satire that nails everything from homeland security to race issues, while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear. carrie anne moss turns in a comedic performance i never imagined would come from her! she's sweet, funny and sexy! billy connolly is great as fido who can only grunt and moan! and dylan baker as the dad is priceless. in fact the whole cast is perfect. henry czerny as the bad guy, tim blake nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend (getting the idea now?) funny, though-provoking and just all round amazing! go and see this movie! it's like nothing you've ever seen before.
