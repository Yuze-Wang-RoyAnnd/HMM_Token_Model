i saw "el mar" yesterday and thought it to be a great movie. it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: ramallo, manuel tur, and francisca. after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet again.<br /><br />religion, sickness, love, violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension-filled movie.<br /><br />i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story. it's a violent, intense and sad story. people are expected to suffer. to cry. to get hurt. to bleed. and i think that what the film shows, isn't done for pure shock-value or presented in a distasteful way. i know that some people like their films "clean", even those with violence in it. but sometimes, a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work. this is one of those movies. and a great movie it is.<br /><br />the only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details weren't 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie, it all made sense. but it wasn't anything of much importance to the overall story, so i still give this movie a 9.
