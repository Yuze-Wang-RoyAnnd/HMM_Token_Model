this gloriously turgid melodrama represents douglas sirk at his most high strung. it eschews the soft wistfulness of "all that heaven allows" and the weepy sentimentality of "imitation of life" and instead goes for feverish angst and overheated tension. and of course, it's all captured in vibrant technicolor.<br /><br />the cornball story has something to do with a friendship between rock hudson and robert stack that becomes a rivalry when hudson snags the affections of lauren bacall, but who's really paying attention to the story? dorothy malone won a best supporting actress academy award for her splendidly over-the-top performance as stack's sister, who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will. a highlight of the film comes when this high-spirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom, unable to bear the restraints placed upon her by middle-class propriety. as so frequently happens in sirk movies, the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectiveness.<br /><br />sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high art, satisfying the philistines and the high brows at the same time within the same films. his was a unique talent and i don't know that there's ever been another film maker quite like him since.<br /><br />grade: a-
