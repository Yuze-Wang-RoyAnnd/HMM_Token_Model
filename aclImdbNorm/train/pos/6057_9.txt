sure, for it's super imagery and awesome sound, it's a great home theater "show off" disk, but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary. the parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. young, old, boys and girls alike will find that deep down, we are all fans of the automobile, especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. the mark knopfler and ry cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content. i don't want to give away the ending, but the final driving sequence to quincy jones' "days like these" just might bring a tear to your eye. enjoy it!
