its a shame she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie .she had much more impact than avril , or just about anyone else in the film . she almost made s/m look like fun ! she really was believable has the s/m model that gets scared of her situation . although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy , those sets were very well built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot . this is one film were both cuts should be made available. it seems they left out a lot of what was shot , and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented . its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming . what was shot would not have gotten a r rating probably a nc-17 or x , but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been .
