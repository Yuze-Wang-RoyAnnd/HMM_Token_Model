as this happens to be one of most favorite novels , i was very excited to see the move. i was not disappointed! yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on , but i think that the movie stuck true to the book, and was a really good movie. it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review , but this is one of the good ones. it is such a dark story , which i guess is why i like it .. and what is better than the dead coming to life.. and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too. if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book!! it is a well written screen play , the actors could have done a better job ( i only say this for rachel , and ellie .. she was so whinny ) i liked everyone else a lot.. and most important to me .. it stuck true with the novel.
