this is movie is very touching. i don't care what people say about this movie, this is a very good movie. the performances by amitabh bachchan's role has the dying father is great, because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and akshay kumer was great in his role as the spoiled aditya thakur. the supporting role of shefali shetty who played the role of sumitra thakur was magnificent. priyanka chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie. ragpal yadav as the brain-dead servant and boman irani as the show-off father-in law have a very good connection and the comedy scene's were hilarious. the direction is very good.
