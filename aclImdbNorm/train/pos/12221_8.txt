this is a nice piece of work. very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout. its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made-for-tv: full screen, and though there were several sex scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but boy did it come close!). strange, too, since netflix shows that it was rated r.<br /><br />nonetheless, very titillating, and i wish alicia silverstone made more movies like this.<br /><br />one netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series, but i have been unable to find out what series that is. i'd like to find out, though, because this movie was that good.<br /><br />walt d in lv. 8/23/2005
