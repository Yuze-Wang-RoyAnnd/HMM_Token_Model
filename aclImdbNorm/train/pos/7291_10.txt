when you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it. that's not the case with this one. a great story about a young girl who's had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things right.<br /><br />eric etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps to convey the complexities of the blurred line of right and wrong.<br /><br />both the young girl and the father give great performances in this wonderful short film, but eric's performance is definitely the show stealer in this story.<br /><br />i definitely recommend this film for it's complexity, performance, and great over all story.
