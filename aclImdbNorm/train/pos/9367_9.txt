it's not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh, and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears. many movies try to do this, but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did. adam sandler practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts, but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isn't pulling him down. i'm not going to ruin anything, but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering. even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie. don cheadle gives another great performance, but is out-shined by sandler. liv tyler and jada pinkett smith give solid performances, but nothing in the line of the two leading roles. sandler's humor is still present, which actually saved this film from being border-line depressing. there are several laughs to be had, but don't think you will stay there long, because it gets serious again without much warning.<br /><br />i could go on and on about how well this movie hit on just about every emotion the human body contains, but i will cut this one short. i feel there is no need to tell you anything more. do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie. even if you have to wait until it comes out on dvd, it's 100% worth the time. a deeply moving film sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face...unless of course...you are a heartless soul.
