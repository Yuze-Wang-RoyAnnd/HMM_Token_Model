i think it's a great movie. because you get to see how diana's life at home is. she got so much aggression, and she wants to prove that girls can fight too. i think she and adrian were great actors. because of this movie i am boxing too. it really impressed me. the only negative part i think. is the end. because it's alright between diana and adrian. but you don't get to see how it is at home. and i didn't really like it that you also don't get to see how her father is doing, and her brother. but i think it was a great movie and i think i'm going to watch it a lot more:) i recommend it to anyone, even when you don't like boxing, you get to see a lot more than only boxing. i had a great time watching it.
