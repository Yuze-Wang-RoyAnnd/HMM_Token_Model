this is the magnum opus from the swedish king of crap, mats-helge olsson. seldom has a movie of this magnitude been made in sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in swedish film to date. who pays for these things? <br /><br />the russian nuclear scientist markov wants to defect to sweden. but his plans are ruined by the russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in sweden. this trickery is their way of seeing to that markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the whole planet. the cia however is bent on getting markov to the west and send their ninja to liberate him.<br /><br />the practice of having swedish actors speaking english is something that mats-helge has perfected in his later works. the cheap b-movie feeling this creates is probably unmatched for performance. but besides this? well the action is standard direct-to-video style. machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke. thousands of russians dying. people running around in black ninja suits, trying to hide in the snow.<br /><br />what really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed. when they say "ninja" in the title i expect martial arts, i expect close combat. but there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie. and they are hilarious. it's so bad i lack the words to describe it. if the ninjas moved any slower their hearts would stop. and of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special-effects budget consisting of four food-stamps and a mcdonald's voucher.<br /><br />so what's the verdict? instant classic of course. never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol. it's the ultimate party movie. insert into video and laugh. one just has to realize that movies like these are not made any more. this is film history.<br /><br />therefore the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
