i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart! no other story had such a unfinished ending... i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites, because it was so unusual - a story about unfairness, and cruelty, and loneliness, and life, and choices that can't be undone, and the need for others. chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother, but the wolf is alone, too, when chirin follows him into the mountain. the wolf doesn't kill the lamb, even though each night he says "maybe i'll eat you tomorrow." the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use. i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child. stories like this, with this depth and feeling, and this intricacy of meaning, are very rare. it is a sad story, but i've never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made. i am glad i have seen this movie, and i'm glad i saw it as a child.
