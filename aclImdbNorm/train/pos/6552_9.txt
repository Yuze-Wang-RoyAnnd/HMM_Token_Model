usually i don't really like emma roberts so much, but after watching nancy drew it kind of changed my mind. the actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny. most of the time when you watch a mystery movie you can solve it before the middle of the show, but in this movie it's like you are actually there. the clues have to all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime. i am still amazed how she found it out. the whole movie was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the movie too. the clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. i don't think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out. i give it a nine because the popular girls didn't really seem to have the part just right, but they still make me laugh. it was a really great movie and a great mystery. i definitely recommend watching it.
