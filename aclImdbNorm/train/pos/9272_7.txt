this was the first of panahi's films that i have seen, i saw it at melbourne film festival. i was totally absorbed by the different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared to aussie kids and yet on other levels how similarly. i think perhaps if more people could see movies like this, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown. there are the obvious large political differences between oz culture and iranian culture, but i found the more subtle differences between the characters, that this film fleshes out so successfully on screen, extremely fascinating. there are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem to me, so unique. i found it made the characters compelling viewing.
