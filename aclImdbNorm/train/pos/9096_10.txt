adorable! i saw domestic import in philly in october with my kids. we all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents. i haven't heard them laugh like that in years! it was the first time that i can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy. it's really cute and we can't wait for it to come out on dvd. they need to make more movies like domestic import. it is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and not be embarrassed). i have not seen a movie this cute since my big fat greek wedding. i loved mindy sterling as the mother. she was also in austin powers. howard hesseman is in this too and he is hilarious. i remember him from wkrp.
