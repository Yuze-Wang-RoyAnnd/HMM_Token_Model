i first saw this movie here in the u.k. in december 1989 when central tv broadcast it. i still have the video tape, although worn out (over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been chilled by it!). <br /><br />anyway, i remember coming home that night, grabbing a christmas tipple, switching the lights out and watching what was advertised as a 'christmas ghost story'. even now i remember certain scenes that still send the hairs on my neck standing on-end... <br /><br />i have seen some comments on the movie which say it's not this and not that...i think those people get scared by friday 13th and the like, stalk and slash rammel, which are laughable. this is a 'traditional' ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effects...no swearing, no blood, no gratuitous sex scenes, no chainsaws or guns etc...so how refreshing!!!! it's atmospheric. if you like chilling horror, well written, well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. i like the original horrors; only last night i saw the original haunting and that is a superb movie. very atmospheric again - and so is the woman in black. the end of the movie differs to the book, but still very good. i recommend it. try it...you *will* like it if you like traditional ghost stories...so...turn off the lights, turn up the fire, lock the doors, grab a drink...and enjoy... :)
