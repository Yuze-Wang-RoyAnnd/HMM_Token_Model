anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies. this film is riveting and doesn't have a boring moment. why? because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis. i repeat--intelligent dialogue! that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmer's films, and that is why a lot of people don't like them. they prefer action. fine, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like this.<br /><br />rohmer has always been accused of being "talky." well, he is, but to me that's a compliment, not a criticism. shakespeare was talky, too. is there a talkier play than "hamlet?" whenever the subject, or theme, of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values, there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values, an that is largely what this film is all about. aristocracy and noble birth vs. egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person possessing that life is not so nice, or even despicable. (anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky, or "crime and punishment?") these are what this film is all about.<br /><br />the two leads in this film are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. lucy russell, who is english and speaks french as her second language, is especially brilliant. do yourself a favor and see this riveting film. it may be the last film by this screen master.
