this movie, to me, is about family. jimmy morris lived his dream not just for himself, but for his family. i can't begin to tell you how i would be able to tell my little girl that daddy was going to kansas city to cover priest holmes and the kansas city chiefs. she'd think it was the coolest thing, like morris' son did. living dreams with the family is what this one is about. i think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what jimmy morris did.
