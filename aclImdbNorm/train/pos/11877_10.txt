directed by brian de palma and written by oliver stone, "scarface" is a movie that will not be forgotten. a cuban refugee named tony montana (pacino) comes to america for the american dream. montana then becomes the "king" in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in miami, florida. this gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. this movie has around 180+ f-words and is almost three hours long. this movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. you cheer for the drug-lord, and in some scenes you find out that montana isn't as evil as some other crime lords. this is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this. you will not be disappointed. 9/10
