"zu:the warriors from magic mountain" was and is an impressive classic! you never would have guessed it was made in 1983. tsui hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions.) even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. "legend of zu" is connected to "zu"warriors from magic mountain"! it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. the plot is a bit hard to follow. but to be honest it doesn't matter. it is all about the action and adventure! i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi. now we know,he made this movie. maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that. there is so much happening on the screen,you simply won't believe! i think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in holland. because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like "superman returns" or xmen 3. the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor! in most of tsui harks's movies he combines drama,fantasy,martial arts and humor. somehow it is missing in this movie. again i am not going to be picky about these small matters. "legend of zu" delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. a true classic!
