i approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. it is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years, especially "strictly ballroom". while the music is nice and the dancing colourful, for me the movie is not about dancing. it is about the very japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life. he is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. also japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience. attitudes to ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-western, though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to japan. the cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. even without the cultural insights, the colour, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch.
