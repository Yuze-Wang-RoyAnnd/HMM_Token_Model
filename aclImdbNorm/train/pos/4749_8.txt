i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds. but this movie i enjoyed, mostly because i'm used to the usual hk action films. most of the films like this are don't watch it for the story line, watch it for the mindless action. and mindless action is right. you get to see jet li jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. it's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon 4. that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped. most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film. but you need to remember most hk film budgets aren't nearly as high as a north american film, and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them. if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing.<br /><br />my rating was an 8.
