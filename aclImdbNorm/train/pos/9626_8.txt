warning! spoilers ahead!<br /><br /> spoilers<br /><br /> i've seen movie in german, so it might be, that i missed some clues.<br /><br /> despite some weakness in the plot, it's a movie that came through to me. i liked especially lexa doig's acting. sometimes i got impression, that she *is* camille. but i can't stop wondering, what happened at the end with bob, cassie and baby. i belive, she, after initially being set on bob, eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him. otherwise it's a bit strange, that she would carry his baby and love it. it's up to viewer to decide - and i don't like such endings. dean cain was as good as ever, eric roberts .. well, i've seen him better but also worse.<br /><br /> i believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story.<br /><br /> bottom line is, i liked it very much.
