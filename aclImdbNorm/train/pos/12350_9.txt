i'm not sure how i missed this one when it first came out, but i am glad to have finally seen it.<br /><br />this movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of okabasho, japan. it tells the tale of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of japan.<br /><br />it is uniquely akira kurosawa! even though he died before he could direct this movie, his adaptation of the screenplay shows. his view of the japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other. the characters may revolve around each other, but the caste system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in. the samurai warrior who drifts into the good hearted and loving prostitute's world goes back to his life, while she embarks on a another road with a man who is part of her caste system..lowest of the low. many prize the world of the samurai above all others, but yet, it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint. the samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one, while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones. <br /><br />the movie deserves a higher rating. it is a tale of survival of women in feudal japan. during this time frame, men were thought to be the survivors..the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property. this movie highlights the strength of japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival, and how their strength enabled the japanese culture to continue on as it has.<br /><br />i recommend "the sea is watching" to anyone who is a fan of akira kurosawa and even if they're not a fan. it is a lovely, quiet and soul sustaining movie, and one to be treasured for any movie collection.
