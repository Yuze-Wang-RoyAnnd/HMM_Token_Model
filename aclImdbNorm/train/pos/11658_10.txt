first animated feature film from ireland is also one of the best animated films i've ever seen. its a real warts and all story that is unlike any of the other oscar nominees and any other film from this year or any other year.<br /><br />the plot of the film has the abbot of kells, a village in ireland building a wall around his town to prevent the vikings from destroying the town should they ever attack. his nephew brendon, is a young monk who does the best he can but meets the ire of his uncle by doing things in his own time. when a legendary illuminator aidan arrives from a destroyed monastery, brendon drifts towards him and his warm personality. much to his uncle's chagrin aiden offers to teach brendon how to illuminate. in order to help aidan work on his great book, saved from his destroyed monastery, brendan goes out into the forest to get material to make ink. while outside the walls he meets ashley, a forest spirit with whom he develops a friendship. unfortunately the abbot finds out that he went outside the wall and there is hell to pay. but lurking in the distance are the vikings...<br /><br />forget what you think you know about this film you're wrong. even what i've explained doesn't do this film justice. its a simple story with so much more going on. this is a wonderful movie about trying to find your way in the world, over coming demons and finding the beauty of the world outside of the walls. (as the film says the world is a dangerous place and doesn't cease to be even if you build walls).<br /><br />its a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all of life including the darkness. there is death and destruction and joy and happiness. its not sugar coated. people die. monsters lurk. (it freaked out some of the kids), but in the end there is hope. frankly the darkness in this film is completely unlike anything in any recent american film. forget the "sadness" in a pixar film, this is the real thing, and its refreshing and it shows how homogenized even pixar has become.<br /><br />its a genndy tartakovsky-esquire (samurai jack) animated film who's look is actually based upon the the celtic art of the period. its a film that looks unlike any other. here again is another film that takes the movie frame and uses it in every way possible. the images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible. often the film manipulated things to make it look like a page in the legendary book of kells. its stunningly beautiful and best described as art come to life.<br /><br />director tomm moore has fashioned a film that is a masterpiece. i can't say more than that. its a masterpiece. its one of the best animated films i've ever run across.
