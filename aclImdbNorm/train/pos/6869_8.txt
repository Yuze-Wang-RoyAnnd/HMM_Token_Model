this film may seem dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 -- before saturday night live, before howard stern, back when george carlin was just getting beyond the hippie dippie weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. this film is the granddaddy of them all. enjoy it for its historical significance, as well as for its strong entertainment value.
