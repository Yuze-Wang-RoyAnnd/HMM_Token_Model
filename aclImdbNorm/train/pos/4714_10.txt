famous words of foreign nightclub owner roman maroni, that "lousy cork sucker" who spends the whole movie not only as johnny dangerously's rival, but butchering the english language as well.<br /><br />another underrated classic that you can only find on afternoon matin'ees or "late late late show"'s, johnny dangerously is a terrific satirical hit about a good hearted boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for his mother's medical care and put his brother through law school.<br /><br />yes there's a story, but who cares?? a cast that includes joe piscopo, dom deluise, marilu henner, and alan hale jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next.<br /><br />there's too many laughs in this to put on here. like airplane, you have to pay attention or you'll miss something. highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two!!!
