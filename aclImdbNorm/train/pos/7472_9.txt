i really liked this movie. i've read a few of the other comments, and although i pity those who did not understand it, i do agree with some of the criticisms. which, in a strange way, makes me like this movie all the more. i accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public, yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch. i also love the movies, such as this one, which provoke so many debates, theories, possible endings and hidden subtext. congratulations mr.crowe, definitely in my top ten.<br /><br />p.s. saw this when it first came out whilst i was backpacking in mexico, it was late at night and i had to get back to my hotel and i had a major paranoia trip! where does the dream end and the real begin?
