.......playing kaddiddlehopper, col san fernando, etc. the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream. i love watching him interact w/ amanda blake, or don knotts or whomever--he clearly was having a ball and i think he made it easier on his guests as well--so long as they knew ahead of time it wasn't a disciplined, 19 take kind of production. relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there.<br /><br />he reminds me of guys like milton berle, benny hill, maybe jerry lewis some too. great timing, ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades, sheer enjoyment about what he was doing. his sad little clown he played was good too--but in a touching manner.<br /><br />personally i think he's great, having just bought a two dvd set of his shows from '61 or so, it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me. i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so.<br /><br />check this out if you are a fan or curious. he was a riot.
