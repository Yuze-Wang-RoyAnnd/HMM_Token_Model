good show.<br /><br />the basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. there is a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced. mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys? there is moral decadence in a virtual world. there are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. i predict (based on the bsg background) that there will be an issue with cylons and slavery. in addition to this, there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves.<br /><br />this show is not bsg -- at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making. there are not a lot of shoot-em-up or space-based special effects either - at least not in the first few episodes i have seen so far.<br /><br />what it does have are very good stories, characters, and themes. it also has good performances from the actors. they can make a culture which is similar to modern-day society, but alien at the same time be completely believable. like bsg, this show is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potential, and flaws. it may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties, antique cars, and chicken. but those things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point. whether you are from a mafia-style culture or an affluent and high-tech culture, humans and human nature aren't that different 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past than what we see in the world today. wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.
