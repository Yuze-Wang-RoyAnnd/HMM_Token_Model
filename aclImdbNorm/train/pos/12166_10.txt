a very strange and compelling movie. it's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser/salesman. the director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well. original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life. there is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should. one of the more memorable films i've seen in a long while. hasn't left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by bronstein. fantastic performances all around. the simple line "i really appreciate it." is now iconic to me.
