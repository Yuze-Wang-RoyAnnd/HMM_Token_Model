three scumbags get their just deserts after wasting their lives in greed, drugs, ego, and bad attitudes. interesting and well done; this style of film always makes me wonder where reality leaves off and imagination takes over. even though these folks were the scum of the earth i still found myself pitying them. they never really stood much of a chance.
