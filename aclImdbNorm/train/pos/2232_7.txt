i saw this when i was 17 and haven't seen it since. the 'cbs late movie' used to show it on a regular basis at one point. i remember how sad and upsetting it was, it truly made me sick to my stomach. effects then weren't what they are today, but nevertheless, it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the amazon, after losing both parents and searching for a way out, very well. i remember the bugs and maggots the most, so realistic they were, eating her flesh. it's a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time, even though likely it was strongly edited for tv. i wish i remembered more details, and if i ever get the chance to see it again, i can comment more. i have been looking for this for years. i believe it may have been shown on cbs under yet another title. i have no idea whether it was ever released on video.
