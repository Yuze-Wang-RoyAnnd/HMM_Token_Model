this movie struck home for me. being 29, i remember the '80's and my father working in a factory. i figured, if i worked hard too, if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream, the house, a few kids, a car all to call my own. i've noted however, without a degree in something (unlike my father that quit at ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can't get anywhere.<br /><br />i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs. it's made for tv, and i just saw it an hour ago. ic an't find it anywhere! i'd love to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once upon a time, americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished!! i think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas...
