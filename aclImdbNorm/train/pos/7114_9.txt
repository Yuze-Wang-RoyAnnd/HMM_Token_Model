definitely at the top five of best john garfield movies has to be pride of the marines. it's the true story of marine private al schmid who at the cost of his own sight, while wounded held off a horde of storming japanese on guadalcanal. <br /><br />the story nicely segments in three parts, al schmid's home life where he's a simple working stiff who's just getting serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his bowling night. pearl harbor is bombed and he's off to war as millions of others were.<br /><br />the second part is at guadalcanal and we see part of the action where he's in an isolated machine gun nest, holding off japanese troops. his action prevented marine positions from being overrun, but a grenade does in his eyesight.<br /><br />and of course the third part is his painful adjustment to civilian life and to reassure himself that people aren't just caring for him out of pity, most of all that girl he was seeing eleanor parker.<br /><br />this film was broadcast on tcm on john garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary on garfield hosted by his daughter. one of the people interviewed said that garfield was the actor most believable in working class roles in having and holding a union card. <br /><br />in that respect he was lucky in that he did land with warner brothers in hollywood. though he kept getting typecast in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio, garfield was terrific in these parts because of his background, because he came from the kind of life al schmid had, with the exception of garfield's jewish background.<br /><br />in that respect he was perfect to play the part of a working class hero like al schmid who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. no super heroics here, just a guy who'd rather have been back in philadelphia, but doing a job that had to be done.<br /><br />it's a great part for garfield. it's a film one shouldn't miss. i do wonder though whatever happened to the real al schmid.
