this is not a movie you watch for entertainment, at least most people i know would not.<br /><br />it's portraits the cruelty to both body and mind that happen in a war pretty well, the characters seem plausible, especially because you "read their minds", something more often found in books and rarely in movies, however done very well in this piece. i would place it next to "all quiet on the western front" and "die br"ucke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression.<br /><br />i wish i could screen it at school, along with the other two movies - however finding a copy of it showed to be pretty hard - which is a shame.
