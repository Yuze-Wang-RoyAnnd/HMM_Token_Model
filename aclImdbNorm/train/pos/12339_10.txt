loved joan. great performance. what isn't she good in. i watched this film and then jane eyre right after... she just keeps getting better. my heart was racing. great old movie drama. just what i want from a classic movie. facial expressions are worth the whole film. i'm glad i have it on video. don't know what more you need in a film. beautiful woman....wealth..... greed.....murder....detectives......a trial.....<br /><br />the costumes are very nice. makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie? wish they still made films like this. whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie. films in black and white still hold a certain mystery.
