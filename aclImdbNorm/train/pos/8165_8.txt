the dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had it's psycho. we had mad police officers, ambulance men, secretery's and that was just for starters. the dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everyman's nightmare.<br /><br />the plot is twisted. super clean dentist doctor feinstone lives perfect life in his great "white house", he has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist. dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty irs guy (terminator's earl boen), dirty pool cleaner "cleaning" his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seems to have gone through dark filter. he goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way. and you don't want to come to his path.<br /><br />crew were professional. producer/director brian yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like re-animator and from beyond. he directed the sequel to re-animator and his first movie society was nice spinoff from john carpenter's they live. film's producer pierre david is known from movies like scanners. cast was great. corbin bernsen really suprised me. i knew him from la law and major league, but i could newer dream him as a psycho dentist. he was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person. linda hoffman was beutiful and dumb as feinstones wife. micahel stadvec did not have much line's, but after i saw him with ladies of the neighbourhood i knew my future profession. ken foree (dawn of the dead, from beyond) was nice sight as cop on the case. virginya keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to feinstone.<br /><br />final warning: if you're like me and have problem with dentist's then maybe you should skip this one. but if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots nasty drillings.
