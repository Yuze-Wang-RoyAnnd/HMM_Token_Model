had i been familiar with the stage production of guys and dolls before seeing the movie, i might not be as fond of it as i am. although in all fairness, i would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both brando (for his acting) and sinatra (for his voice, although he is quite the actor as well, see the manchurian candidate or from here to eternity.)<br /><br />as for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs, i have the broadway soundtrack and though isabel bingley's voice outshines that of jean simmons, it is not more pleasant. i find it to have a rather shrill quality. jean simmons' voice is much more realistic, though admittedly, that is not always a huge concern in musicals. also the only time i particularly noticed marlon brando's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of "luck be a lady" and only there because i was previously familiar with sinatra's version. i also find vivian blaine's voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on broadway. and sinatra's voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others, if they indeed were in need of redemption. (they weren't) it is infinitely better than sam levene's, particularly in my favorite song, 'sue me'. <br /><br />also, the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs, i beg to differ. 'a bushel and a peck' is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it, 'pet me poppa" and its accompanying performance is more hot box material. i personally do not care for 'marry the man today' at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie. i adore 'i've never been in love before', and though it was not sung in the movie, the instrumental version can be heard when nathan is in adelaide's dressing room. the song 'a woman in love'expresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach. and the movie wouldn't be the same without the song 'adelaide', not included on broadway. in fact, if the movie soundtrack were available for sale, i'd recommend purchasing it instead of the broadway. <br /><br />though i have not seen the original production, i cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie's lead actors. <br /><br />the important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so.
