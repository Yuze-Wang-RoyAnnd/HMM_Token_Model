as of this writing john carpenter's 'halloween' is nearing it's 30th anniversary. it has since spawned 7 sequels, a remake, a whole mess of imitations and every year around halloween when they do those 'top 10 scariest movies' lists it's always on there. that's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around $300,000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent. i could go on and on, but the big question here is: how does the film hold up today? and all i can say to that is, fantastically! <br /><br />pros: a simple, but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood. an unforgettable and goosebump-inducing score by director/co-writer john carpenter and alan howarth. great cinematography. stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high, gets some great shots, and is careful not to show too much of his villain. good performances from the then mostly unknown cast. a good sense of humor. michael myers is one scary, evil guy. a lot of eerie moments that'll stay with you. the pace is slow, but steady and never drags. unlike most other slasher films, this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count.<br /><br />cons: probably not nearly as scary now as it was then. many of the goofs really stand out. <br /><br />final thoughts: i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series. i know that's not a popular opinion, but it's really how i feel. despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs. and just because it's been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it'll be forgotten. no way, no how.<br /><br />my rating: 5/5
