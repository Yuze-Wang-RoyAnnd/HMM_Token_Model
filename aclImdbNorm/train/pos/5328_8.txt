i can still remember first seeing this on tv. i couldn't believe tvnz let it on! i had to own it! a lot of the humor will be lost on non-nz'ers, but give it a go! <br /><br />since finishing the back of the y series matt and chris have gone on to bigger and better(?) things. nz's greatest dare-devil stuntman, randy campbell has often appeared on the british tv series balls of steel. yes, he still f^@ks up all his stunts because he is too drunk.<br /><br />also the 'house band' deja voodoo have since released 2 albums, brown sabbath and back in brown. the band consists of members of the back of the y team and singles such as 'i would give you one of my beers (but i've only got 6)' and 'you weren't even born in the 80's' continue their humor.<br /><br />the south-by-southwest film festival also featured their feature length film 'the devil made me do it' which will be released early 2008 in nz.<br /><br />all up, if you don't find these guys funny then you can just f%^k off!!
