in april of 1965, cbs broadcast the first of barbra streisand's monumental television specials. the show was not only a runaway ratings success, but garnered 5 emmy awards as well. this is one of the most memorable moments of 1960's television and (unfortunately) the kind of television special they don't produce anymore. filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by barbra, this special is a must view for any streisand fan and anyone interested in early television.
