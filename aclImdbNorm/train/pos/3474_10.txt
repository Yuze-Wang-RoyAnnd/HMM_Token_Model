this film is worth seeing alone for jared harris' outstanding portrayal of john lennon. it doesn't matter that harris doesn't exactly resemble lennon; his mannerisms, expressions, posture, accent and attitude are pure lennon. best scene: lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether paul mccartney & wings' "silly love songs" is worthy of #1 status in america.
