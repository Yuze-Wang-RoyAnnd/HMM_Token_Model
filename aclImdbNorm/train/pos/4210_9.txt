i really enjoyed this film. all aspects of the film were top notch including the most important, for me anyway, the screenplay and the acting. this is definitely one of richard widmark's strongest roles. he is totally convincing in his performance. just out of curiosity, imagine how humphrey bogart or robert mitchum might have tackled this role. this is my first exposure to jean peter's work that i can remember. she impressed so much here that i will definitely be on the lookout for her other work. thelma ritter, in an unglamourous role, deserved the oscar nomination she received for playing the informant. this film works on every level. the black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning. widmark and peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. strongly recommended, 9/10.
