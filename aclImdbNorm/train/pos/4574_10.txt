let me state at the outset that i have cerebral palsy and i went into this film expecting to have to make allowances for the lead performance. i left the theater half-convinced that they'd cast an actor who had cerebral palsy in the role, even though i knew that was not the case. the performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to brenda fricker and to hugh o'conner (i believe that's his name) as the young christy brown. christy is talented, brash, arrogant, at times vulgar and petulant-in other words, human. this film, along with gaby: a true story and the documentary king gimp, are excellent portrayals of life with cp. by no means a complete portrait, but fine examples of the disabled as human beings. most highly recommended.
