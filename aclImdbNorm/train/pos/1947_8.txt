spoilers. like other posters, i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. i would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return. i suppose the writers anticipated this problem by "front loading" some voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it's all moot.) i did like how admiral janeway died for the voyager crew. as fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. i admit that the scenes of janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp. fortunately, mulgrew(s) pulled it off.
