i first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and i could not stop laughing. everything about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting. as far as film is concerned i wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic. it gets it's meaning across. the cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie. corben berbson, fred gwynne, ruben blades, and ed o'neil are hilarious. for this who haven't seen it, i will give you a brief synopsis: four criminals meet up in a small town in montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. however when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from new jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. the film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of oceans eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in montana rather than las vegas. all in all if like to laugh i would strongly encourage you to see this movie.
