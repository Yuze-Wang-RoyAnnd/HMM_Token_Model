eva (hedy lamarr) has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon, she realizes that her husband does not desire her. her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love, makes eva returning to her father's home in a farm, leaving her husband. one afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva. they fall in love for each other and become lovers. later, her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home. eva refuses, and fortune leads the trio to the same place, ending the affair in a tragic way. i have just watched "extase" for the first time, and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network: the movie has only 75 minutes running time, and it seems that it was used different reels of film. there are some parts totally damaged, and other parts very damaged. therefore, the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer, if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale. the film is practically a silent movie, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. consequently, the characters are badly developed. however, this movie is also very daring, with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty. another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers, symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover. the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear. the non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. i liked this movie, but i hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version. my vote is eight.<br /><br />title (brazil): "^extase" ("ecstasy")
