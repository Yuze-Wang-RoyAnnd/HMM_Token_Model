unfortunately, the director amos guttman died from aids-related illnesses the year after making this film, so we don't know how many more gay-related films we might have had from him. i found this used dvd, from cinevista, on amazon, but it looks like none of his other works are still available. hessed mufla (amazing grace) contains full frontal male nudity, at least in magazines, which turn into a wishful dream sequence. and some drug use. this is the story of two families getting by, or trying to, but the mothers, the daughters, and the gay sons all have their own problems to figure out. jonathan (played by gal hoyberger) meets up with the next door neighbor thomas, who has his own problems, of course. either the translations are a little weak, or maybe guttman kept the conversation sparse on purpose, for a little mystery. watching this, i get the feeling we're not getting the whole story, but that's ok. throw in a cute gay roommate ex-lover miki (aki avni, who went on to do many projects, mostly isreali tv) lots of smoking. lots of worrying by the mothers. a great blues song "all night long blues" done by an unknown female artist; if she is listed in the credits,sadly it was not translated to english. nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect, like any other relationship. but then, usa always has been years behind other countries in this way. a good way to spend 98 minutes... i wanted to see even more of it. won awards at several film festivals, acc to imdb and the film jacket.
