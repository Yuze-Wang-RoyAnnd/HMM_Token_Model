apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties, eugene pallette as the gruff police detective, jack la rue as the "swarthy" italian and of course, james lee as "the chinese cook", this film is the great mystery of a murder in a locked room. for an early 1930's film, this step by step "peeling of the veneer of the mystery" is similar to the columbo series, except in this film, you don't have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance.
