four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble: parties, drugs, cops, mixed-up parents, older boyfriends. jodie foster, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like "a family" (like the family unit she's never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't. slowly, everyone grows up and goes away. that precise plot point, though underscored throughout, is unfortunately tampered with. did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard? or an even longer sequence--also with baio--where foster has a strange soliloquy about the "pain of illusion". some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and i didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding. but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. and jodie's face at the ending speaks volumes. if viewers do get choked up at the end, the movie has earned this. it doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy. it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand. *** from ****
