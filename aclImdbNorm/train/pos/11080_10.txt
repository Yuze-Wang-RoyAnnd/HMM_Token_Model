first of all, when people hear 'guy ritchie', they immediately think of snatch. yes, snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch. they don't expect him to explore new frontiers. this movie revolver is different than snatch; it's much darker and is very complex. the reason i gave a rating of 10 is because i've had to watch revolver 3 times to understand everything. so this movie toys with your head. it's very cleverly written.<br /><br />this movie is different than snatch. it was done wonderfully, the cinematography is beautiful, and you can recognize guy ritchie's personal touch (style of directing) in it.<br /><br />what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers.
