sarah silverman is like a totally manic zooey deschanel and i think i'm in love already. yeah, if you loved jesus is magic, you'll love this. if you didn't, what the heck is wrong with you? kudos to the comedy channel for shoving this in my face. my life finally has meaning, and "your car smells like farts" is my kind of humor. i'm a happy guy. the first episode had me laughing hysterically and i'm hungrily looking forward to next week. this is like grease meets south park. completely outrageous. sarah silverman is someone i could watch reading the phone book. her delivery is precise and oh so funny. she never skips a beat. come to think of it, it's not so much her choice of material. which is some really good stuff by the way, as it is the way she chooses to deliver it. thank you, sarah silverman! thank you, comedy channel!
