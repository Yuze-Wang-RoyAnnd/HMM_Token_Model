i'm glad that this is available on dvd now. this film is an excellent example of the triumph of content & style over empty-headed flashing lights & constant loud noises.<br /><br />essentially, if you have a short attention span or lack the wit & imagination to engage with literary narrative you won't like this film. the reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: matthew jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of catherine storr's novel 'marianne dreams' successfully to a screenplay. an unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know.<br /><br />the casting is excellent, allowing director bernard rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now; they indulge in the craft of acting! i know, i know, actors doing their job & acting instead of resorting to mugging inanely at the camera lens whist a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions & fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat, but it does actually happen in this film.<br /><br />this brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker & not the spoon-fed tabloid reader - apart from a solid script, direction & acting, it relies on atmosphere, suspense & implied horror. if it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of 'paper house' is more in the vein of sophocles than tobe hooper.<br /><br />in conclusion then, if you like lots of loud noises, explosions, constant cuts, & bright flashing colours you'd be better off watching 'transformers', but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a skillful & evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you cacophonous nonsense then this might just be your thing.
