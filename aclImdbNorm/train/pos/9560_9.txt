admittedly, i first picked up ranma 1/2 when i was around twelve. i was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read. then, i went to the comic/manga section and spotted this book. at my first few reads through the chapters i didn't really know what was going on, but i knew that i loved it. i even took it home for a few more reads over. frankly, i wasn't getting anywhere. and then, about five months (i'm 16 now) ago my friend was watching some anime series and i remembered about this manga. i couldn't remember what it was called, but recalled that the author was rumiko takahashi, creator of inu yasha. i googled it, and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes. at first i was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics, but it didn't really matter in the end. no anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind, watch again. i once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day. i don't know how i did it... but i couldn't stop. eventually, after about two days, i grew obsessed. i even dreamt--as crazy as this sounds--about watching ranma. never have i found a series so enjoyable, so funny, and so heartwarming to watch. to this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied. of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers, but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading. <br /><br />ranma 1/2 is about a boy named ranma saotome and his dad genma saotome. intense martial artists. they are so intense, that they went to the ancient training grounds in china and became 'cursed'. the grounds were full of different pools of springs, and if you land in one, you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water. for genma, that was a panda, and for ranma that was a... girl! it's a very crafty fun loving story. on top of that, genma promises his friend that ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the tendo dojo alive. 'course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual. obviously they start to like one another, but both way to stubborn to admit it. but.. genma has a history of doing this. he promised ranma to many girls. <br /><br />trust me. it's worth watching. it's humorous, heartwarming and all around amazing.
