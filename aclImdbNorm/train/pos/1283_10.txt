the film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. the idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in. naturally, the film takes place in los angeles/orange county. he attacks stand up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, blockbuster hollywood films, and touches on many other mediums. eventually, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion. the film is five years old and rings more true every day. it's the best description of post-punk anger i've ever seen. it's also one of my top 10 favorite films.
