in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of jess's brother here is my response:<br /><br />the role of jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. craig sheffer/norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how jess's brother turned out. there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel, for example, when jess's brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later. the dramatic irony was there so craig sheffer's character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death, knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film.
