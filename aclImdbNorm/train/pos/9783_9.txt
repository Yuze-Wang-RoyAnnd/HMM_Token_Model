how you could say that peaches, with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues, is "a small tv idea" is beyond me. besides i can think of many films that have "a small tv idea" in their plots. your obvious dislike of the tv industry (" sue smith has failed to rise above her television background") is confusing. particularly as you are having such "a great time" working in tv. if only we could all be so talented as ms smith (no, i am not a friend or relative) - afi award winning brides of christ, road from coorain,etc. all made for tv. come to think of it, what about those other "small tv ideas" like "against the wind", "bodyline", "the dismissal", "scales of justice", "blue murder", "water under the bridge" ,etc. i think peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested, and most of my friends as well, from start to finish. it is far from flawless yet i think it is among the best australian films i have seen over the last couple of years. who knows, with a few more viewings (there's so much to think about), it might just be up there with classics like "the year my voice broke", "the devil's playground". i really did enjoy this film much more than "somersault" and "three dollars". these films, i think, had their moments-surreal, atmospheric, realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues, but as for sheer entertainment for mr.and mrs average movie goer and me, it was very ordinary if not boring. when i go to a movie, i am always conscious of the audience's reaction to a film (through in- cinemas reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo). some came out of peaches shaking their heads, some with negative criticisms, but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience.
