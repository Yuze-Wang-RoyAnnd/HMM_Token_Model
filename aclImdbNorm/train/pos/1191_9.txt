robert taylor as the mad buffalo hunter charlie gilson is the main character in this film. at the beginning i was thinking that charlie would end up redeeming himself like john wayne in the searchers or james stewart in the naked spur. but as the film goes along gilson keeps doing more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him. stewart granger is sandy mckenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing. gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or human beings. debra paget as the indian girl is a surprising character considering the self imposed censorship of that time. she lies with gilson in total resignation even though she hates him. the last scene of a frozen gilson, is unforgettable.
