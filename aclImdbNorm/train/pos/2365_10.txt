jeff wincott is not only a hunk, he can kick butt! this movie has some of the best martial arts moves i've seen in a very long time. ok, so maybe bridgette nielson isn't the first person i'd hire to play a ruthless politician, she did a great job nontheless! and let's not forget that wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expert/stuntwoman karen sheperd. so she's not cynthia rothrock, who cares?! she's just as good, if not better! (just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie, one word: ouch!!). my suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you haven't seen it, you're really missing out on some great martial arts action.
