i have just recently read the novel "mother night", i've owned the dvd for some time now, and watch it every so often. few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has, i am amazed at the brilliance not only of vonnegut, but of the translation of his text to screen.<br /><br />do not rent or watch this movie on vhs, it must be done on dvd, and it must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film. to see how they took a fairly simple story, yet complex in its substance and dialogue, and made it work so well, i think any viewer will be amazed.<br /><br />the omissions in the movie are few from the text, and do not detract from it much, the movie might as well be the book, and is the best adaptation i have ever seen. i so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch it.<br /><br />it will change you if you do.
