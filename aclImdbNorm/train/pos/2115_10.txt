after seeing you've got mail and feeling disappointed, i decided to see the original movie which inspired this one, the shop around the corner. i was amazed at this movie. it's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times. the acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, that if you haven't seen it, i wish to urge you to see it today. i'm not against re-makes and sometimes i like the new version more than the original one, but this time have to admit that you've got mail is a poor adaption of this classic. don't miss it, go to your video store and rent the shop around the corner today!
