at first,this movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a trance the first time i saw it.it was like a bad dream.a cosmic bore.but i gave it a second chance,then another and another,etc...i finally got addicted to this film,due to it's dreamlike slow pace,wonderful natural sets,bathed in a mellow autumn light and especially the musical score,which is made of some 70's progressive rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by actor/singer/songwriter derek lamb(the troubadour).you should notice the song about hazel wood,silver trout and lady vanishing in the air...,heard in the middle and near the end of the film.there are some carnal scenes in the beginning ,wich allow us to appreciate the natural charms of elizabeth suzuki.if that movie had been made by some "repertoire" directors like bergman,lars von triers or jean-luc goddard,critics would have rolled on the floor,raving about that movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece.i personally think this film is one million times superior to any of fellini's cinematic sh#
