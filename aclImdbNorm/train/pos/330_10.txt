i'm italian and when i've recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty: the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it, but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings. now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema (pasolini etc.), by that time gone. <br /><br />the hollywood epic films are good...for fun. perhaps this 'odyssey' had no english version because is not enough funny... not suitable for pop-corn and coke audience. however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflections.<br /><br />in italy was recently released a very good dvd version: integral, with excellent colors. you can find it in some file sharing, but it's italian only, and without subtitles. too bad: also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable.
