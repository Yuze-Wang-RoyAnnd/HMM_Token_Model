worst movie of all time? wow, whoa now. you cannot be serious.<br /><br />maybe it's all about what you expect a movie to do to you. i live in oregon, so i got to enjoy the beautifully-filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful smith rocks and other areas in central oregon (as well as the sweet cameo of our own ken kesey and ken babbs looking down on baby sissy's cradle at the beginning of the movie). those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than "average" score.<br /><br />or .... maybe it's all about what expectations you have. having read the book ages ago, and thinking to myself "goodness, no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting, quirky, weird book ... especially 20 years later, when mores (morays -- can't put in the accent mark online) have changed" -- i was actually quite pleasantly surprised when i first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again.<br /><br />sissy was exquisitely cast, and i don't care what you all say, i was also pleasantly surprised at rain phoenix's and john hurt's performances. i am not a lesbian nor bi nor trans, but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray -- and those "real" folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted. stilted a bit, stage-ey -- always a bit "on." gus van sant is one weird native oregonian but by garsh he done a good job adapting this crazy book, imho.
