after hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat, serling continued to go about introducing viewers to 'the twilight zone' in a very strange way by scheduling one the series biggest growers as the fourth episode. 'the sixteen-millimeter shrine' is one of the more understated episodes, focusing on an aging movie star's inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes. because of this approach, the episode is under whelming at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short story.<br /><br />both the leads, ida lupino as barbara jean trent and martin balsam as her frustrated but caring agent, shine in their performances. the main problem with the episode is that the supposedly 25 year old footage of the actress is unconvincing. lupino looks identical when playing the young trent as she does when playing the middle aged trent and this diminishes the tragedy of the situation significantly. fortunately, lupino acts her socks off in convincing us of her desperation to return to the past. it's a situation most can sympathise with, and yet trent is far from a sympathetic character. she is a prima-donna who gives little thought to the feelings of those around her, such as the disastrously withered co-star who she tactlessly belittles because he reminds her of just how long ago her glory days were. it is somewhat surprising, then, that she is rewarded with a happy ending. it is clear what is going to happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen and it is cleverly pre-empted in the opening moments when trent scares her maid by stepping out from behind the screen. what is not clear at the beginning, however, is whether being sucked into the projector will prove a reward or a harsh lesson in appreciating what we have and living in the moment. as it turns out, trent is allowed to return to the past she longed for, a testament to how strong the wishful thinking of humans can be.<br /><br />'the sixteen-millimeter shrine' gets better with each viewing. the top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past, even though we can never return. except in the twilight zone.
