the great talents of michael powell and emeric pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful "a matter of life and death". it was part of the recent tribute to mr. powell that played at the walter reade in new york. this film, in particular, shows us one of the best british films from that, or any other era.<br /><br />"a matter of life and death" has a brilliant cinematography by jack cardiff, a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera. particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven, and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth. this was quite a coup, and well ahead of its times. the black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where peter and the conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any film.<br /><br />much has been said in this forum about the film, so our comment will be about the great acting powell and pressberger got out of the large, distinguished cast, who responded magnificently to the directors' guidance.<br /><br />david niven, is peter, whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it. this film marked one of the highlights in mr. niven's career. he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie. kim hunter is surprisingly good as june, the woman who talked to peter as his plane was falling from the skies. as fate would have it, peter and june fall in love at first sight.<br /><br />some of the best british film actors grace this film with their presence. robert coote, is bob, the man who is admitted to heaven, but he is surprised his friend peter never made the trip with him. an excellent star turn by marius goring, who as the conductor 71 steals the film. mr. goring, who had worked with the directors, is one of the best things in the movie. also, roger livesey, as dr. frank reeves, does one of the best appearances of his career, as well as raymond massey, who is seen as abraham farlan.<br /><br />"a matter of life and death" is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators.
