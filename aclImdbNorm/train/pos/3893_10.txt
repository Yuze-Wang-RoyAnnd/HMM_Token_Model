what more could anyone want? he's a history lesson, foreign language tutor, nra representative and ambassador to burundi dressed in a nice silk frock and heels. i laughed so hard i left a puddle. his woes about puberty, transvestism, public school, and done in several languages made the absolute finest stand-up routine i have ever seen. i think about it now, years later when i see cake (tea and cake or death) and hear something translated into french (the mouse is under the table, the cat is on the chair and the monkey is on the branch. i like his versions of what jerry dorsey could have been named before he settled on englebert humperdinck. i really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy. he has a lot to teach us, and a wonderful way of telling it. thanks for your time.
