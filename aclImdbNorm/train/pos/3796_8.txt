jim mckay has made one of the best films you will see all year.the quiet simplicity of this film draws you in from the opening shot and never lets go.there is not one false note in the entire film.not one.everything works.the hand-held camera is never distracting and always where it should be.the three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real.there isn't a single beat where the audience is reminded we are looking at actresses performing a role.these are just real girls trying to find themselves.there is no political agenda,hidden or otherwise.this is cinema at its most basic,and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of movie-goers,it deserves a much wider release.a special hats off to hugh hefner for providing the film-makers with the grant money needed to get this important film made.i can't wait to see what mr. mckay does next.
