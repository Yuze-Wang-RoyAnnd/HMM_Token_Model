morgan freeman and paz vega are the mismatched pair who get in the car and go about doing errands according to the need of one or the other. morgan freeman is superbly human, relating with one and all, while paz vega is the edgy cashier behind the "10 items or less" check out line, intimidating customers and bored out of her mind. together they explore, discover, and learn from each other. to do that of course they must be vulnerable, interested in change, and have a sense of humour, all of which they both have. i wish this film was realistic, i wish this type of story happened more often, i wish we didn't have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even if we come from vastly different backgrounds. the film's message is based in the open heart, and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other from there - a world where peace could be a possibility.
