no, there is another !<br /><br />because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i, ii & iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy, i will state the good points of "the return of the jedi" and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel. of course, i loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but this has been overly debated elsewhere.<br /><br />what we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - a strong ecological concern - anti-militarist positions - fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force - cute creatures - harrison ford's smile - a killer scene : near the ending, when vader looks alternatively at his son and at the emperor. the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet. and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke, thereby risking his own life ! oh, boy !<br /><br />what is wrong in the prequel inmho : - the whole "human factor" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults, than about wisdom - too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen - the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot <br /><br />by the way, if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web (obi wen, i mean) and yoda, then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japan.<br /><br />the magic of star wars, imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice, from a father to his son, albeit the difficulties. "de mon ^ame `a ton ^ame", (from my soul to yours), as would write bejard to the late zen master t. deshimaru.
