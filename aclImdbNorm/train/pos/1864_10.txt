i just watched antwone fisher on bravo. what an awesome movie and incredible young man. this movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult. denzel washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays antwone fisher. kleenex alert--feel good and tearful. the most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother, who he was taken away from at 2 months of age. and one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister. i saw this movie on bravo in 2008 and only wish i had known about it years ago. definitely a movie to add to my dvd collection.
