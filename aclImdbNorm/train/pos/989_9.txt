both my friend and i thought this movie was well done. we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts. we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy. i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job. most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid. we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie. if you don't buy rent it for a good time.
