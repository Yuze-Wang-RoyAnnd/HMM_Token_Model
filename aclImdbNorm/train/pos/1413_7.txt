in 2006, the ampas awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on earth, that film was march of the penguins narrated by academy award winning actor morgan freeman.<br /><br />walt disney studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now. they've taken their stabs at live action film making and it's been hit and miss all across the board. disney then created a sub-division called disneynature and release its first feature film titled earth. this is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries i've seen in quite sometime. <br /><br />narrated by the great james earl jones, earth doesn't offer anything new to anyone who has watched the discovery channel in the past five years or follows the global warming crisis very closely. earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter.<br /><br />it enables an emotional connection to nature that i haven't experienced before. it also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our gorgeous planet, but the grunt and disturbing aspects that it often entails. it's one thing to watch "mufasa" fall from a cliff in to a stampede or bambi's mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods. it's all good because at the end of the film we know it is, just that, a film. this shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all types of families, from all walks of life, living and dying in their natural habitats. these real things make a real movie experience.<br /><br />though a bit heavy-weight on the graphic nature of the film (which many people will disagree), earth is a touching experience. there is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by george fenton. in comparison to march of the penguins or grizzly man, it doesn't really hold any measure but it stands great on its own. at the end of the day, you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places we'll witness in the film. we live here yet it's like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another. earth is beautiful.<br /><br />***/****
