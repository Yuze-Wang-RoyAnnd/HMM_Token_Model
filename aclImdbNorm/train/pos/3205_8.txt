i saw this in the theater and i instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video. i am a big nut for sci-fi action flicks though anyway.<br /><br />without giving any of the story away, it is worth seeing if you like sci-fi without requiring much thought. the story is basic, and the plot is very good. worth your time to see!<br /><br />maybe they will make a sequel? :)<br /><br />8 out of 10
