this movie is very great! the acting is fine, with excellent casting of corbin bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients. in the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman, and then he goes crazy. he also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman, beside the patients he tortures. the most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really fake (like a drilled-out tongue, that has laid for 1 night outside, and is still red in the morning). but the torture scenes are absolutely well-done. though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow; between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts. but for the real horror/thriller-fan this is a must-watch!
