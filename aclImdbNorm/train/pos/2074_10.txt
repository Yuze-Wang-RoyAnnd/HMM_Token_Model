another channel 4 great canned long before it's time. compelling acting from phil davis and the rest of the cast. sexy, intelligent and funny. i remember watching it at the time and even then, asking around, no-one had really heard of it. but trying to find someone now who can recall it is even harder. perhaps channel 4 don't do their job well enough in drumming up the enthusiasm needed. either that or the general public is too interested in the tv vomit that is big brother. i suspect the latter. downloading of garth merengie's dark place prompted channel 4 to release a dvd of that series. let's hope the same can happen with north square.
