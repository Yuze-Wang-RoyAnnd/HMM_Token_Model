the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. it's peak years were between 1968 and 1972. one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle, who had a small but fanatic cult of followers. she was actually able to act, unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks, and her subsequent credits proved it. and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique.<br /><br />gary graver, the director, was also a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skill, combined with monica gayle's screen presence, makes sandra, the making of a woman, a pleasantly enjoyable experience. the film never drags and you won't have your finger pressed on the fast-forward button.
