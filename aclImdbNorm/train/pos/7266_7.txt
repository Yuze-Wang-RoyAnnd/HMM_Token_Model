i remember having a pretty low regard for a venture like this when it was first released. james "not jim" belushi, a hammy kid actress, and a cheesy title in a john hughes formula. you couldn't have paid me to see it 15 years ago. but, i got caught up watching it while wasting away a sunday afternoon, and it hits me on a couple of levels. the fairy tale (part pretty woman, part reverse pretty woman), the very vulnerable, elizabeth_perkins_in_miracle_on_42nd_street -like performance by kelly lynch, the escapism. over all, it gently pulls some very nice strings. it's pretty hard not to fall into the story, develop a crush on kelly lynch, identify with james belushi, dislike the stiff bad guy boyfriend, and laugh at the curley sue lines. has all the ups and downs, with a happy ending, and the kind of message you want to hear. go ahead, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
