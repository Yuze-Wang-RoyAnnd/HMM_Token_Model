the first of two jim thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the other being the more well-known grifters), after dark has all of thompson's hallmarks: dangerous women, the confidence game, and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being, or not as harmless.<br /><br />jason patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring (director james foley uses raging bull-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story) and the too-little-seen rachel ward also delivers a great performance. but bruce dern is the film's secret weapon: his sweet-talking grifter uncle bud subtly commands each of his scenes.<br /><br />there's almost no comic relief in this film, so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void.
