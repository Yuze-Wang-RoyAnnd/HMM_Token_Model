the movie "atlantis: the lost empire" is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently. parents who have had to sit through "the jungle book 2" or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one.<br /><br />the film is one of few to attempt at an original story; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories. films such as "toy story", "finding nemo", and "monsters inc." all do the same, but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney. recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video, and are sequels to an existing successful film. the quality of those films is given way to the profitability. a new era started with "atlantis" following it were "mulan", "lilo & stitch", and most recently "open range". the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past.<br /><br />a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years. including that of young milo thatch, voiced by michael j. fox. milo is employed by a museum in washington d.c.. his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist, who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis. this was seen as a waste by his peers, and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps. after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition, milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment. she takes him to her employer, a mr. whitmore. whitmore was a close friend of milo's grandfather, and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis. mr. whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything. the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers. the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch. the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis. the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis, not just the discovery of people. it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience.<br /><br />the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation. the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images. a feat not easily achieved, most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two. the characters are believably human. there are some nice chase type scenes, with lots of action going on. a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get.<br /><br />the creativity of the writers really shines through. the culture of atlantis is richly developed, including an entire language. the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources, such as plato. the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained. believable, if by a younger audience, that magic really does exist. the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic, but can best be described in this way.<br /><br />although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic. the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemo's nautilus, complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes. the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology. the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been, even holding roles in leadership. this is not a bad thing. it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to, rather than an all male cast.<br /><br />one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song, ever. a tradition that began with the first feature film, "snow white", and carried on through to "the lion king", almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs. this is great and all, what would the seven dwarfs be without "hi ho!"? after the millionth time through it'd almost be better without, but this one spares the parent. not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song. i for one am grateful.<br /><br />the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike. it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children.
