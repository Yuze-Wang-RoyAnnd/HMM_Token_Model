whilst reading through the comments left for this show, i couldn't help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will. the thing about kerching! is that it's a children's show, for children so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy, forced, and probably stupid. i even found one person saying the sets were stupid, but i remember as an eight year old wondering why taj had ikea icecube moulds on his wall, and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine (they didn't). yeah, it can be annoying, the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair, but as a kids show, i rate it 10/10. compared to the stuff they air in its place today, well, lets just say i wish it'd be re-aired. dvd release, anyone?
