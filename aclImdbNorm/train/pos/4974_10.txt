this was a delightful presentation. hemo (blood) as a greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority and innocent wonder. the quote (or scene) i recall vividly is when hemo tires of "all this plumbing ... you haven't learned my secrets at all" and threatens to storm out, the scientist answers him in a single word "thalassa" -- salt water which horrifies the fiction writer but mollifies hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood. <br /><br />such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released. stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning.
