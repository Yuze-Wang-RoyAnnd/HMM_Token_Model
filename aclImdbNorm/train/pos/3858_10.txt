director paul verhoeven's american vehicles are of varied quality, but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable masterworks. this is the story of alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman. but the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's handsome male lover. in the meantime, the writer is plagued with strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse, but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions. fascinating hitchcockian thriller, very original and provocative. i love films that make you think they are about something, but then you realize they are about something completely different. this is one of those movies; a thriller during the first half, and a quasi-religious surrealist saga during the second half. very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for kids or people that go to church every sunday. great cinematography by future director jan de bont. highly reommended!
