mr michael jackson is an artistic phenomenon. his short movies, i.e. music videos, are simply the best. i do not care if i get a sane sci-fi feature from this man, but i do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing, shriek yells, cool crowd choreography, and some bits of cgi and animation. there also should be a few uninterrupted videos. everything i've mentioned is here. stupid plot and over-the-top "vanity fair" are not a problem when i witness mr michael jackson in action. to me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos (not "king of pop" which sounds moronic, especially for us, russians, because "pop" sounds like the russian word for "arses" and mj is definitely not "king of arses"). i can re-watch his best music videos (which are artistically beautiful) and i never get tired of them.<br /><br />my first impression of this film was "what is this...?" (bits of different videos, some drawn images, unsettling jumps from one theme to another, absence of any cohesive plot line, some kids fooling around, etc.) but as i watched it till the end, i could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on tv nowadays. what i like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily.<br /><br />without mr michael jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor. even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of mj musical insanity and artistic quality. he knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles.<br /><br />when i see a proper dvd release with mr michael jackson videos i know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release. "history i", "history ii", and "moonwalker" are all great, though only "moonwalker" is more like one movie (with a solid "smooth criminal" theme, "paparazzi" topic, and a few weird spoofs and twists).<br /><br />being no fan of mj i can still give this "film... like no other" a solid 9 out of 10 (i've been hit by "smooth criminal" for sure and my major complains are the following: initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main "mj anti-drug campaign" should have been given more "sky-rocketing insanity and stress" and there should have been more "moonwalking" itself of course). thanks for attention.
