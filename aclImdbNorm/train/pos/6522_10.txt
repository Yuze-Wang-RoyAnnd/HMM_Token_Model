during the whole pirates of the caribbean trilogy craze paramount pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this anthony quinn directed cecil b. demille supervised movie and getting it on dvd and blu ray with all the extras included. it is obvious to me that paramount pictures execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in new orleans, louisiana which would have helped make the crescent city once again famous for it's pirate connections. when the execs at paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then i will be a happy camper. paramount pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now !
