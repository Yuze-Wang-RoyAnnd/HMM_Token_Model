an ultra-nervous old man, "mr. goodrich," terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing, really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it, saying "you will be next!" <br /><br />he calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier. of course, it's the stooges, who couldn't respond because had come into the office, robbed them and tied them up. some detectives! the moment poor mr. goodrich hangs up the phone and says, "i feel safer already," a monster-type goon named "nico" appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious. we next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that. now these crooks have to deal with the "detectives" that are coming by the house for mr. goodrich.<br /><br />some of the gags, like moe and larry's wrinkles, are getting a bit old, but some of them will provoke laughs if i see them 100 times. i always laugh at shemp trying to be a flirt, as he does here with mr. goodrich's niece, in a classic routine with a long, accordion-like camera lens. the act he puts on when he's poisoned is always funny, too. shemp was so good that i didn't mind he was taking the great curly's place.<br /><br />larry, moe, curly/shemp were always great in the chase scenes, in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house. that's the last six minutes in here. at times, such as this film,
