this game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics. spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. the city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of venom and carnage are appearing all over the city. who is behind these crimes? could it be doc ock? well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later spidey will unravel the mystery. the fighting is basic, not to hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather fun. you get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city. however, that is also a weak point. the swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as spider-man seemingly attach'es his webs to the sky. you also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say spider-man 2 movie video game. still, it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story. so be prepared to see scorpion, rhino, venom, mysterio, doctor octopus, and carnage for one wild action packed ride.
