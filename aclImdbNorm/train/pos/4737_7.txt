hak hap(black mask)is what i'd like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. sure the plot has been tried and heard before, (a biologically engineered soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of supermen that decides he feels that killing and brute force aren't the ways to settle every thing and becomes a pacifist, and a librarian. but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police -his best friend is a cop- he becomes the black mask.) the style that the movie goes for, very visual, works and at least for me is entertaining. i love martial arts movies that are a spectical. people flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop. but that is what this movie is about anyway right, a showcase of jet li doing what he does best, and that is spectacular showmanship of his skills, which to say the least are top notch. as with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala. jackie chan and sammo hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time, these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical feats. but i must say, even with the large holes left in the plot (like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had 20 men that are no more than 15 feet from him with sign of escape? who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment.......ohh well suspension of belief i guess) , the movie to me stays interesting. it is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter. but still all around a great high paced action movie.
