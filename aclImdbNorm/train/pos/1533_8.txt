what network was , diagnosis murder on? i thought it was cbs. am i right or?? also, back in those days, the actual production h.q. was near about the van nuys airport. i surely remember, because i practically made nearly two episodes in those daze. more. i remember the early days. i had found an article in reader's digest giving this actor/writer a clue to a terrific episode. so just for suggesting it i was awarded. awarded or not, i sadly didn't develop it, and was cut out of it all due to poor publicity of mine. so as a justification i learned as i always have, the hard way... roll the dice..craps!!! just a side bar on mr. van dyke. he had a house in the brentwood area on chalon road and it was an incredible party house. dick had a terrific sense of modernism when he built that house.
