24 is the best television show!!!!! it's an incredible tv series with an incredible suspense, excellent plots and unforgettable characters. and the first episode of all is my best evidence. because it's only the first episode, only the introduction, and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns.<br /><br />jack bauer is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of the senator david palmer. he can't trust in anybody because people of the ctu may be involved. and, when this events occurred his daughter: kimberly escapes from house to a party. but...<br /><br />at the end of the episode, you want to watch more, and more, and more. <br /><br />it's only the first of the lot, and it's excellent.
