so this made for tv film scores only a 7.6 on this site? bah! humbug! without question this 1984 version of dickens' classic tale is the best ever made. and yes, the hound has seen the 1951 version which was also good, but not good enough. the lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version, although the acting was wonderful.<br /><br />george c. scott is simply incredible as ebenezer scrooge. we all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then by three other spirits later on that evening. scott is properly gruff as scrooge. too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the new-found glee that he awakens to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson. but hey, this is george c. scott. he's never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy. he has too much dignity, and his scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic manner.<br /><br />the supporting performances are uniformly excellent, as are the costumes, music, and scenery. 19th century london comes to life in clive donner's visionary style. the film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits. the important tale of morality shines through in every frame, though.<br /><br />you won't often find this version aired on television anymore, and that is a disappointment. the 1984 version of a christmas carol should be a required part of every household's celebration of the holiday. when the decorations come out of the basement, this film should find its way into the dvd player at least once during the season.<br /><br />10 of 10 stars.<br /><br />the hound.
