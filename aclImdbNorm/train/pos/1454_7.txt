i had been long awaiting this movie ever since i saw the trailer, which made it look like a political drama, starring three of my favorite actors; al pacino, john cusack, and bridget fonda. and even though it was directed by harold becker, who has done uneven work, he and pacino did combine on sea of love, which ranks among each of their best work. but interference on some level(for starters, several of the scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie) and changing of tone(subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) make this, while watchable, nowhere near as it could have been.<br /><br />which is too bad, because i really wanted to like this movie. there was great potential here to be a film about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about that corruption, not the usual good guys vs. bad guys. and there is good acting here. pacino and cusack are both very good, and danny aiello gives one of the best performances of his career. but fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central storyline, when it turns to a thriller, the movie loses its way, briefly recovers in the final scene between cusack and pacino, and then falls down completely in the end. i wish i could like this more, but no.
