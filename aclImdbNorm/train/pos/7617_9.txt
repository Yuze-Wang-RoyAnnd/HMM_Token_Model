a very addictive series.i had not seen an exact combination among drama, action, suspense and sci-fi never before. i am impressed every chapter. the screenplay is very intelligent, i don't know how the creators invent all this amazing stories, every character have a strange past, troubles, stormy relationships, it gives to the show the human sense needed for creating intimate characters.<br /><br />the most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related among them: the numbers, they have met before without knowing it, and so on. the others, enigmatic security system and the darma initiative are elements that don't let us lose a chapter.<br /><br />mr. jj abrams, what did you think to create this amazing story?
