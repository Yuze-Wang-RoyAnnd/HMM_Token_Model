ok, even if you can't stand liza- this movie is truly hilarious! the scenes with john gielgud make up for liza. one of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century. dudley moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch! the one-liners are the best.
