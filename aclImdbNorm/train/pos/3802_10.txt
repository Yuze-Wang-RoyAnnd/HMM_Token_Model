dragon hunters has to be the best-looking animated film i've ever seen. it was jaw-dropping. the film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash, their weird furry blue dog that pees fire, and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight, and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler, an impossibly immense dragon. but honestly, it doesn't even matter what the film is about. because, it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. the gravity in this fantasy world is different, so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike, and there are forests of floating lily pads. the world is so creative, so uniquely beautiful, with a sort of muted storybook look to it. the world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings. the monsters are visually stunning as well, like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats. some of the plot isn't too original, like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world; but the gorgeous graphics, some seriously sinister scenes, and emotion-evoking dialog makes this film spectacular.
