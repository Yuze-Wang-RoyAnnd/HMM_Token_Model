simply put, oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. it is filled with memorable songs - "food glorious food", "oliver!", "consider yourself" and "oom-pah-pah" to name just a few - and equally memorable characters.<br /><br />the film is a musical adaptation of charles dickens' classic novel and much like the story of oliver twist itself, it is a perfect family film. there are some frightening moments - the villain bill sykes played by oliver reed is scary enough on his own - but overall, the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults.<br /><br />the story - which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now - revolves around a little orphan boy named oliver and his life growing up in london. at first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his fellow orphans but after daring to question mr. bumble, the overseer, he is sold to a family as a servant.<br /><br />after a series of mishaps and close shaves, he meets the artful dodger - superbly played by a young jack wild, who gives his all in the role - and through him, the greedy fagin (ron moody), who trains young boys to pick pocket treasures which he keeps for himself.<br /><br />the film was shot solely in studios and on soundstages at shepperton film studios but this does not translate at all to film. the sets perfectly replicate victorian london, as do the costumes worn by the characters. a multi-oscar winner and a massive success on its release, oliver! is a worthy contender for the best musical all of time and will delight anyone who loves film.
