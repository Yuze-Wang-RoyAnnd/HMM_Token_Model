one of several musicals about sailors on leave, it is the usual sailor meets girl, complications ensue, sorted out happily kind of plot. it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too. the dialogue is not as zippy as 'top hat' for example and randolph scott seems out of place.<br /><br />there are compensations. it has some of irving berlin's choicest songs including 'let yourself go', 'i'm putting all my eggs in one basket' and 'let's face the music and dance'. it has fred and ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here. they do a snappy tap dance, a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance, all in the same film! great versatility and artistry.<br /><br />it also has harriet hilliard who is rather good in her role. she had a varied career, becoming the more famous harriet nelson with ozzie. here she is touching without being sentimental.her two songs are simply and effectively delivered. she makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film. <br /><br />more tightening up have made the film even better. pretty good though.
