the time is the future and for many not aware of it, that day is now. in this final movie for legendary actor, edward g. robinson, "solent green" becomes a landmark classic. many a film buff and environmentalist believe this is our eventual history. the movie is taken from the novel entitled, 'make room, make room' but who's working title was changed to "solent green." the story concerns the earth as it evolves into the future with the world's environmental problems becoming nothing short of catastrophic. the planet's natural resources have been exhausted and basic food has been reduced to simple staples. they come in a variety of colors, such as solent yellow, solent red, and now 'solent green.' however there are those who know the 'real' ingredient in solent green and cringe at their own culpability and fear divine retribution. the first is a food executive named william r. simonson (joseph cotton). upon his death, a dedicated police detective called robert thorn (charleston heston) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. although corruption goes all the way to the top, it begins with simonsons' bodyguard, tad fielding (chuck connors) and security chief donnovan (roy jenson) who target thorn for a waste desposal factory. thorn's boss, lt. hatcher (brock peters) believes his suspicions but warns him of those 'higher and hot' who want the case closed, but thorn will not risk his "job" for an easy way out. what thorn discovers marks him for death, but like the film, awaits a final warning. ****
