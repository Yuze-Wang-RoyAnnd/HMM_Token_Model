"perhaps we can arrange a meet. " "where are you now? " "i'm sitting in my office. " "i doubt that. " "why would you doubt that? " "if you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face-to-face. "<br /><br />bourne remains street tough, and elusive. only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy. conversation is macho, to the point with only shards of bond type gallows humour. its all about the action.<br /><br />the feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well. a scene set in waterloo with a guardian journalist does this to great effect. there is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body.<br /><br />if the shaky cam doesn't annoy you too much, enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going.
