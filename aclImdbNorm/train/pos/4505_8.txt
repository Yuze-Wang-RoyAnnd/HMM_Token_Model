eskimo is a serious movie about the cultural chasm between an indigenous population and the encroaching white man. although filmed in a documentary style seemingly with non-professionals, eskimo is a skilled production that contains a believable story the audience will want to see through to the final shot.<br /><br />the native eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than do the whalers that darken his landscape. when an eskimo man loses his mate, it is natural that other men share their women with their friend. it is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing spouse. all of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding arctic setting. the trusting eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous white whalers (with heavy european accents) that do not view these natives as their equals. deceit, drunken orgies, rape, and death occur after the eskimo men depart for work on the icy cold seas. eventually the lead eskimo (mala) realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge. the audience would have cheered in the 1930's theaters.<br /><br />enter the royal canadian mounted police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back mala for trial. the mounties are played as feeling policemen that know this is not a cut and dry case. will the mounties get their man? is it fair to hold mala to a code of behavior outside of his traditional society? is there a way out that does not punish mala? is it inevitable that the white man's law must prevail? is there no hope for innocence?<br /><br />this is not a great movie, but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the issue addressed in a very different setting. i suspect that the filming of the sequences with animals was done before today's disclaimer that none were injured in the making of the film -- so beware of the raw nature sequences. highly recommended.
