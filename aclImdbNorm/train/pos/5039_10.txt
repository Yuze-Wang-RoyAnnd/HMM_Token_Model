stunning. absolutely stunning. this is a movie about two kids who's father suddenly has a vision. he claims an angel visits him, and tells him that they need to kill "demons". he gets instructions later, and they start rounding up the demons, which are, to the naked eye, ordinary people. they kill these so-called demons with an ax to the head, and chop them up, burying them in the rose-garden. their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them. the movie continues, with a twist at the end.<br /><br />the thing that i love about this movie, is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception. is their father completely mad? or, is he telling the truth? the audience is left to decide. go make the judgment for yourself, and see the movie. now.
