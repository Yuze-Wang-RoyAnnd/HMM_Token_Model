if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd, it was probably 'delirious' you were looking for. how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines? i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time, and when i was old enough to see eddie murphy's 'delirious' and 'raw' (not as funny) i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration. now that i'm older, and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy, i realize two things: everybody steals from eddie, while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard. that's the huge difference: eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful
