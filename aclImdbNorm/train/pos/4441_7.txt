alright, before we review, i have to ask: why isn't this listed individually? it may have been merely a tv item in italy, but to international lamberto bava fans this is its own film. in america this film is distributed on vhs and dvd as either "the ogre" or "demons 3". yes, i know it has nothing to do with "demons" apart from one cast member and the crew. but yes, i personally was upset that this was so hard to find on this site which is otherwise so useful.<br /><br />finally, let's review "the ogre". i've seen the trailer for this many times on youtube and honestly found that rather scary. the movie itself (it is feature length, therefore making it a movie) has many many strong parts and does manage to scare. i was displeased by the last act, but on the whole i don't regret having bought the dvd before seeing it (available from shriek show). i guess the film's tv origins explain the last act. i won't give out any spoilers.<br /><br />the plot is somewhat familiar: an american horror writer vacationing at an ancient spooky castle with husband and son only to find it exactly resembles the setting of her childhood nightmares. there are faint echoes of "the shining", but this is a different brand of supernatural horror. the woman (virginia bryant) finds more and more proof that this is the real life place of her nightmares, but her husband won't believe her. great atmosphere and terror follow.<br /><br />the multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky. the ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a bit of uncle frank's resurrection from the first "hellraiser". there's also a few good shocks and a well done underwater scene. i give them props that the film never stooped to imitating american films with similar concepts, namely "a nightmare on elm street". "the ogre" is an original. and the monster itself was a scary one, when it was presented correctly.<br /><br />on the shriek show dvd there is a lamberto bava interview in which he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic "demons" series. he also gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the movie was filmed. indeed, this setting contributes a lot to the film. the simon boswell music helps too.<br /><br />there's lots of good stuff here. "the ogre" is not perfect, but it is very much worth seeing. take it is a lesser lamberto bava achievement.
