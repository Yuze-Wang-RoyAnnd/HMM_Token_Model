there wasn't a dry eye amongst the audience yesterday afternoon after i left the cinema, having seen this gem of a film in a sold-out house as part of this year's hamburg film festival. and the tears shed were all of laughter. this film was hilarious, there's no other way of saying this. there wasn't one boring bit in it, i laughed right through it and with me everyone else of us three hundred lovers of french cin'ema.<br /><br />alain chabat was absolutely terrific. a great clown if needs be and serious if the situation calls for it. the performance was of course completely over the top, but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well. equally great was charlotte gainsbourg who i love to see a lot, and the mother was also a very strong performance. the sisters could have been a bit more detailed in character script-wise, but apart from that there is nothing to moan about. i had a great afternoon seeing this film while hamburg was drowning in rain outside, and i wish films like this from france would get a regular release in germany. but the distributors is this country don't seem to understand that the french make good films. i at least can't wait to find a dvd which offers subtitles (hello australia? please?) because that film i need at home to watch several more times!
