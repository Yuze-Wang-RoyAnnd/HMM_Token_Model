armageddon ppv<br /><br />the last ppv of 2006<br /><br />smackdown brand.<br /><br />match results ahead********<br /><br />we are starting the show with the inferno match. kane v. mvp. this was an okay match. nothing about wrestling here. this was about the visuals. overall, this was not bad. there were a few close spots here with kane getting too close to the fire, but in the end, kane won with ramming mvp into the fire back first.<br /><br />nice opener. let's continue.<br /><br />teddy long announces a new match for the tag team titles: london and kendrick will defend against: regal and taylor, the hardyz, and mnm in a ladder match!!!! let's get moving!<br /><br />match two: fatal four way ladder match. this was total carnage. judging by three out of the four teams here, you would expect chaos. the spots were amazing. a total spot-fest. one point jeff went for poetry in motion and london moved and jeff hit the ladder! shortly afterword, jeff is set on the top rope with two ladders nearby as mnm were going to kill jeff, matt makes the save and jeff hits the "see-saw" shot to joey mercury! mercury is hurt. his eye is shut quickly and is busted open hard way. mercury is taken out of the match and nitro is still there. he is going to fight alone for the titles! regal and taylor then grab london and suplex him face-first into the ladder! jeff climbs the ladder and nitro in a killer spot, dropkicks through the ladder to nail jeff! awesome! in the end, london and kendrick retain the tag team titles. what a match!!!<br /><br />this was insane. i can't figure out why wwe did not announce this till now. the buyrate would increase huge. i'm sure the replay value will be good though.<br /><br />mercury has suffered a shattered nose and lacerations to the eye. he is at the hospital now. get well kid.<br /><br />no way anything else here will top that.<br /><br />next up: the miz v. boogeyman.(ugh) this was a nothing match. will the boogeyman ever wrestle? the miz sucks too. after a insane crowd, this kills them dead. dud.<br /><br />chris benoit v. chavo. this was a strong match. i enjoyed it. chavo hit a killer superplex at one point! benoit hit eight german suplexes too! benoit wins with the sharpshooter. good stuff.<br /><br />helms v. yang-cruiserweight title championship match. this was a good match. unfortunately, the stupid fans did not care for this. why? helms and yang are very talented and wrestled well. i agree with jbl. he ranted to the crowd. jbl is 100% correct. learn to appreciate this or get out. <br /><br />mr. kennedy v. the undertaker-last ride match. not too much here. this was a slug fest, with a few exceptions. kennedy at one point tossed taker off the top of the stage to the floor. the spot was fine. reaction was disappointing. the end spot was taker tomb-stoned kennedy on the hearse and won the match. unreal. kennedy needed this win. they both worker hard. still, kennedy needed this win. undertaker should have lost. creative screwed up again.<br /><br />a stupid diva thing is next. i like women. not this. at least torrie was not here. that's refreshing. judging from the crowd, layla should have won. the wwe wanted ashley. consider this your bathroom break. next.<br /><br />main event: cena & batista v. finlay & booker t. this was also a nothing match. the focus was cena v. finlay and batista v. booker. batista and booker can't work well together. finlay tries to make cena look good. the finish was botched. finlay hit batista's knee with a chair shot and batista no-sold the shot and finished the match. lame. not main event caliber at all.<br /><br />overall, armageddon would have scored less, but the ladder match was the main event here. that was enough money's worth right there. a few others were solid. <br /><br />the last word: a good ppv with the ladder match being the savior. smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough. smackdown needs to stop letting cena tag along. let smackdown stand on their own two legs. this show proves that smackdown can.
