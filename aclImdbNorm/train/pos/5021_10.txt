i rented this movie and watched it 20 times before i took it back to the store. bill paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists. the story is original and well written. powers booth and paxton both deliver good performances. the story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks 20 years back, then spots in the present, alternating back and forth. this style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can't get dull. bill paxton, please make more horror movies, you have the talent for it!
