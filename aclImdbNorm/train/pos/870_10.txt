"read my lips (sur mes l`evres)" (which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title) is a nifty, twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope.<br /><br />the two leads are magnetic, emmanuelle devos (who i've never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies) and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel (who has brought a sexy and/or threatening look and voice to some us movies).<br /><br />the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he's the neophyte. the second half is on his turf as an ex-con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu.<br /><br />writer/director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability as an entr'ee for us into her perceptions, turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk), using visuals as sensory reactors as well.<br /><br />none of the characters act as anticipated (she is not like that pliable victim from "in the company of men," not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line (well, until the last shot, but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment) as we move from a hectic modern office, to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs. <br /><br />there is a side story that's thematically redundant and unnecessary, but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths.<br /><br />this is one of my favorites of the year! <br /><br />(originally written 7/28/2002)
