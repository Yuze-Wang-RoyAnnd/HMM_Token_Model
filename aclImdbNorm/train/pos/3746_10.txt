i love this movie/short thing. jason steele is amazing! my favorite parts are the french song and in the opening title when the spatula soldier yells " spoons!" i crack up every time. i would recommend this movie to knox klaymation fans, and people who enjoy jason steele's other movies. his style of animation is very original. it takes a few views to notice the detailed backgrounds. his humor is also hilarious, and is definitely not something you'd hear before. like max the deformed spatula who has a sound and light system in his head that beams colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his miserable life. this is a wonderful animation to watch anytime any where.
