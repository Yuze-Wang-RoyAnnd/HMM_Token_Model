"panic in the streets" is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director elia kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in new orleans, using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation. as a result, the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable. an important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster, provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken, then increase the tension to a high level.<br /><br />following a dispute between the participants in a card game, a man called kochak (lewis charles) is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area. when the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus, u.s. public health official dr clinton reed (richard widmark) is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague. reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action, anyone infected could be expected to die within days.<br /><br />as the identity of the dead man is unknown, the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the police commissioner are not fully convinced by reed's briefing. they doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently. the investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community, a group of seamen, the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man's identity and his contacts are eventually found.<br /><br />kochak, an illegal immigrant, had been in a gang with blackie (jack palance), raymond fitch (zero mostel) and vince poldi (tommy cook) and when gang leader blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation, he presumes that kochak must've smuggled something very valuable into the country. as kochak and poldi were related, blackie assumes that poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more. poldi, however, is very ill and unable to provide any information. blackie brings in his own doctor and together with fitch starts to move poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with reed and an exciting chase follows.<br /><br />richard widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man. in an unusual type of role for him, he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of dr reed very convincingly. jack palance's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges kochak's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation. his distinctive looks also help to make his on-screen presence even more compelling.<br /><br />in typical docu-noir style, expressionist cinematography and neo-realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place. elia kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside.
