the sea is watching was an interesting film experience. first of all, the overall feel was intense, internalized, claustrophobic, and small. each frame seemed to be a photograph of something inside, something very focused and not part of a bigger picture. it was obvious what we were to look at in each frame. the physicality of the set itself contributed to that feeling of smallness and intensity. the lights along the middle of the road cut the road in half, and the tiny gate to the tiny settlement followed by the tiny and few cubbyholes that served as the establishments that made up what seemed to be the entire town. even the view of the ocean was framed by a tiny landing on which one can count the number of longer grass swaying in the wind. no panoramic views. in fact, it reminded me of the montmarte sequence of moulin rouge where the camera sweepingly focuses in to the windmill creating again a feeling of a small area where everything is happening.<br /><br />while the acting was passable considering i really could not discern how the lines were truly delivered, i felt that the actions were overly melodramatic and nonsensical. why kikuno would continue carrying on the way she did when fusanosuke announced his impending marriage really didn't seem true
