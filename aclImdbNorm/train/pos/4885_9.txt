possible spoilers re: late-appearing cameos <br /><br />seldom does one see so many fine & memorable character actors (almost entirely actresses to be precise) in one film. even though a few only appear for cameos, each one is a gem. the british do this mix of comedy and real-life pathos better than anyone imo, so it is no surprise that most of the actors are brits.<br /><br />the music is great; no doubt much had to be dubbed (does leslie caron *really* play the bass so well? maybe - who knew?) but clio lane was unmistakably herself - her warm visceral sound still turns my crank like few other jazz singers.<br /><br />as an aging musician myself, not quite as old and certainly not in that class of course, it was a heartening film as well -- a great film for anyone whose wondering if they're past it in their profession or avocation whatever it may be. and of course a great celebration of the life of the stage.<br /><br />i missed a little of the opening, but a provisional 9/10 -- and it certainly makes we want to see the whole thing.
