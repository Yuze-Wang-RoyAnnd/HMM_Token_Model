i used to watch this show as a child, and i loved it! i watched it when it came on toonami years ago....sheesh, i sound so old! i must've been 13 or 14 when it came on...but anyways, it had a great plot line, and i'm one of those girlie-girls who watched (and adored) sailormoon, and i enjoyed it very much. the animation wasn't the best....quite amusing in some parts, actually, and the voice acting was extremely lame in the beginning, but it was all a good watch, and i found myself sucked into it day after day.<br /><br />samurai troopers/ronin warriors is a classic, and an all-time one of my faves. go ryo!!!!
