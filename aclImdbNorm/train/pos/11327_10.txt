this movie probably had a $750 budget, and still managed to surpass titanic. i rented this the day i crashed my mom's car, and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief! it has to be tied with 'the assult of the killer bimbos'. things to look for are: 1. the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2. the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3. the flinstone-like screech out driving 4. the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed (don't worry, i'm not ruining any surprises, for it's soooo predictable) 5. the guy who finds it necessary to howl. 6. the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen. 7. the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall. 9. last, but not least, the wonderful special effects--especially the stab in the boob that made a... heaven help me... popping noise.<br /><br />enjoy!<br /><br />
