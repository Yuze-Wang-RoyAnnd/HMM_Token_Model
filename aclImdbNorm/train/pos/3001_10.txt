cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value. michael curtiz at his best. lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the philo vance series. william powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best. a forerunner to the thin man series. recommend to everyone. did you figure it all out?
