a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store. after he's done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he'll be transferring soon. bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy...and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals. animals like say, a certain rabbit. this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer. i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940's. it still remains as funny nearly 60+ years later. this animated short can be seen on disc 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2.<br /><br />my grade: a-
