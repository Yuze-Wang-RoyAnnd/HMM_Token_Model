spoilers!<br /><br />from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10:00 news, i wanted to see it. i don't remember who it was, or which local omaha newscast carried the review, but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going nebraskan. they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann-margret when she's swimming in the pool. glover's character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth, using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out. i was hooked. there was one problem, though. i was only 13 years old at the time, and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable. let's just say, it was worth the wait!<br /><br />if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine, this movie is it. to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement. the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman. roy scheider, who is as effective as ever, plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains. john glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. he's sleazy, funny at times, and always on the brink of doing something crazy. then there's robert trebor's (nice name, by the way!) character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme. he is a whimpering, sweating, coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models. then, you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy, a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason. who could forget the wake-up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear?<br /><br />after dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up against, scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation, that is until glover goes after his wife! the conflict is played out brutally, with virtually the entire cast getting shot, raped, or blown up. <br /><br />i don't know why i love this movie so much. it really should creep me out, but it doesn't. maybe it's because these characters are all interesting, and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try. it's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glover's running around out in l.a. looking for trouble. just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle. "hey sport, have a nice day!"<br /><br />this film has plenty of shootouts, cool cars, great dialog (like the line in my opening statement), and decent acting. plenty of cameos by real life porno stars. look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glover's place. <br /><br />another thing i must add: how hot are the women in this film??? wow! travolta did right by marrying kelly preston. yum! we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian. and ann-margret. what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty. <br /><br />9 of 10 stars.<br /><br />so sayeth the hound.<br /><br />added feb 14, 2008: rip roy scheider!
