i have loved this movie ever since it's debut in 1981! i have lost track of how many times i have seen it! it never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if i am feeling down. the three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless, plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song? i think i quote this movie without realizing it. i basically know the entire script, so when someone is watching it for the first time i have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it. i can't even narrow it down, although, sir john's character probably gets the most memorable ones. the famous "i'll alert the media" when arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless, but the list is truly endless. the scene's at arthur's soon to be fianc'e's father's house are a scream, particularly his interactions with the moose. do yourself a favour and see this movie!
