for what it is, this is a pretty good movie. i like both johns -stamos ("full house")& stockwell ("christine", "top gun"). they both give strong performances. the love interest is ok, but this is more of a guy's movie than a good date movie. i love harleys, and i hated seeing them paint over the "14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer" with good old army olive drab. there is a small history lesson here in that harley-davidson motorcycles played a key role in wwii. i don't know if the training was quite like this bunches! the movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere, with good riding action sequences. i love looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 (true bike lover, i guess). i wouldn't give it a 10, but i did give it an 8. i do not weigh every movie with the same scale. there are movies that were big-budget, with great actors, that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big. (star wars - episode i is my best example) i loved the first three sw movies, but i thought episode i was weak in comparison. so it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. i expect more from george lucas.
