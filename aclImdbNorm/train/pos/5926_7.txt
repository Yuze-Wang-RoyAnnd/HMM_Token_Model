sleepwalkers are creatures who drain the life force completely out of humans to survive...but they can only use virgins (it's not explained why). charles brady (brian krause) is one such who needs to feed his mother mary (alice krige). he goes after likable tanya (madchen amick). will she escape?<br /><br />on one hand this is a great horror film. fast-paced, plenty of blood and gore and a nice, twisted sense of humor. there are plenty of in joke references for horror buffs (castle rock is mentioned once). also krause is excellent (who would have thought he could act after "return to the blue lagoon") as is kirge and amick. but i find this film annoying.<br /><br />it was written for the screen by stephen king and it's maddeningly vague. the sleepwalkers are never fully explained. where are they from? why are they called that? why does the son have to feed the mother? why do cats hate them and can kill them? what are their powers after all (at one point krause makes a car disappear and change color and style!)? why do they need to feed off peoples' life force? why does it have to be only virgins? why is the son having sex with his mom? none of these are explained leaving the story confusing. it's really too bad because, those questions aside, this is an excellent horror film. excellent makeup and special effects too.<br /><br />fast, gory and lots of fun. if only the script were better. also a fairly explicit sex scene between krause and krige was edited (you can tell) to get an r rating. i can only give this a 7.
