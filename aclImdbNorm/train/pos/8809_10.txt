this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september 11th attacks. this film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on u.s. soil. the aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives. i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point. it also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks. and some of the pieces are actually funny, but not abusively so. this film came highly recommended to me, and i pass on the same feeling.
