you've never seen anything like it. once the coup begins, it's the most dazzling, edge-of-your-seat thriller you'll ever see -- even though you know the outcome. and it's all real, because it's a documentary -- amazing. <br /><br />by the time it was over, it was on my top 10 list of all time great movies.<br /><br />disregard the slobbering right-wing fanatics. everyone i know who has seen this film gives it the 4-star rating. even if you don't care about politics or about venezuelan politics, you will find yourself nerve-racked and -- believe it -- on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />it's a roller-coaster ride.
