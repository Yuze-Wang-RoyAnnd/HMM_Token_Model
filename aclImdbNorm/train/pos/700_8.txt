an insomniac's nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made film. i loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer...the acting was top notch - honestly, i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great as well. i was very impressed by the look of the film, too. usually, "independent films" have a grainy, i-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them, but this director knows what she's doing. the lighting, the cinematography...quality work. i'm looking forward to a feature-length work from tess nanavati!
