ok clara bow silent film from 1927, it's a spin-off of rain, with bow playing the half-hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the staid english engineer--clive brook. bow competes with the local widow (arlette marchal) for his attentions, but both women get a big surprise when his wife shows up (patricia dupont). the predatory wife is ready for a divorce until she discovers he might be on the verge of a fortune. bow settles her hash fast.<br /><br />bow has personality to spare and has a few great scenes: her opening nude bath, her hula in a grass skirt, and the dog rescue scene with bow and brook doing their own stunts.<br /><br />note: the imdb credit list is wrong. the film credits (from the dvd i have) list patricia dupont as playing mrs. haldane---not margaret truax as listed on imdb.
