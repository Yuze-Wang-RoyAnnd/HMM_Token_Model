first of all i've got to give it to the people that got this thing together. 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts. it's a shame, although not surprising, that the movie was banned in the us.<br /><br />that being said i think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments. the movie starts up with the iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of majid majidi's work (the absolutely beautiful "heaven's children" and "the color of paradise"). much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of afgan refugees in iran. absolutely beautiful clip. same goes for sean penn's clip which is superb as well. but just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal. alejandro gonz'ales i~n'arritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut-wrenching "amores perros" he does it as brutal as he can. most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background. those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes, those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families, those who were angry....and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers. a very hard clip to watch and one that you won't forget.<br /><br />some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as "you're not the only ones that are suffering". in particular the egyptian and british clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the us has caused to other people.<br /><br />i will also make a special mention to the clips from bosnia-herzegovina, france, india and japan (although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn't).<br /><br />however, not all the clips are great and i make a special mention on the clip from israel which, in my opinion, is extremely weak. while the idea was good (a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in tel aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in new york is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to) the realization is terrible. the clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air-time at all costs, a guy saying he's a witness and hoping that he can go on tv, and soldiers and paramedics shouting just "because". the clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation.<br /><br />if you happen to have the chance to see it then you should, that is, unless you're a conservative in which case you'd better stay out as you might get offended. but if you're not then you might learn how many of us outside the us lived through 9/11.
