i enjoyed albert pyun's "nemesis" for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. a lot of people complain about the "confusing" plot to the first film, which is probably why "nemesis 2: nebula" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.<br /><br />this one gives the name of the first movie's hero, alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. she is raised by a tribe in africa. a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles, which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). it doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). there are subplots involving africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. the picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. it has its entertainment value, just don't expect quality, or anything of the first movie.
