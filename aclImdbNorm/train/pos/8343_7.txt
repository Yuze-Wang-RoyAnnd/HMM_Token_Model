australian fred schepisi (a cry in the dark) directs this comedy/ romance that is fun, relaxing, and set in the spring. you will laugh while watching this movie. tim robbins (shawshank redemption, dead man walking) is an auto mechanic, ed walters, with a high iq, which gets higher with the help of albert einstein, walter matthau (grumpy old men) and his academic friends nathan, kurt and boris. you can tell them by their preppie shoes. meg ryan (sleepless in seattle, you've got mail) is catherine boyd, einstein's niece who is a competent, but not so confident mathematician. perhaps it is because she is surrounded by all that genius. she thinks that if she marries someone with a high i.q. her kids will have a high i.q. as well, but she does not knows what she wants. between tim robbins cute smile and meg's cuteness this is a refreshing movie. i love sweet stories. people all ages should enjoy this movie. catherine is engaged to the jerk james moreland, who works in animal behavior, but is very stuffy. this is a love a first sight type situation, between the mechanic and the mathematician. witty lines and subliminal lines! the cinematography is nice. princeton, new jersey is beautiful in the spring. with much help from all those brilliant men catherine falls for ed, without knowing that he is an automobile mechanic.<br /><br />favorite scenes: ed taking a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of einstein, nathan, kurt, and boris. ed and einstein riding on the motorcycle. nathan, kurt and boris letting all the research animals free!<br /><br />favorite quotes: albert einstein: "don't let your brain interfere with your heart". ed walters: "when was the last time he said "wahoo""? catherine boyd: "well i'm sure i don't know". this is a refreshing movie, i recommend it. i have the tape and every once and awhile i will watch it again.
