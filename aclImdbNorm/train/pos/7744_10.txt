a must see film with great dialogues, great music, great acting and a superb atmosphere.<br /><br />in the film you will follow 8 people for one day in the city of antwerp, they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird (that's how i love them!).<br /><br />i'm not going to say anything else, just go see and enjoy it.
