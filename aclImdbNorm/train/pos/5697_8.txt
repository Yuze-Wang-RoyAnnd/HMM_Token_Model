may 2004, wonderland is fairly new in the uk. brilliant film of a brutal true story. if you know la from the early 80's, you will appreciate how well it is captured. the use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there. the use of a disjointed 'pulp fiction' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened, while the direction and performances of the cast command attention, especially val kilmer as john holmes; an oscar for sure if i were handing them out.
