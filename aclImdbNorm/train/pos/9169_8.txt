i liked timothy dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for mr r. but i thought zelah clarke too plump and short. this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed. i have seen 4 versions, orson welles is still my favorite mr r , though george c scott did very well and it's a toss up between joan fontaine and sussanah york, although they were both a bit too old for the role. i recently saw a brilliant tv version of rebecca with charles dance and emilia fox. i would love to see those two do jane eyre.by the time i got to watching the ciarin hinds version, i think i was jane eyred out, but i will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing joan fontaine's voice narrate the opening of the first version i ever saw. i always want to go back and read the book again.
