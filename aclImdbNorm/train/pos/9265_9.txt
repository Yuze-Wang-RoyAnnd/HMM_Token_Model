different film directors from different countries have contributed to the film medium a lot by their thoughts. as a result, we have experienced different genres when the medium is concerned. jafar panahi, unlike j.l. godard or f. truffault, believes in simple story telling; schematic narratives is one of the main traits of his directorial job. he has trust upon the automatic as well as critical intelligence of the viewer; he does not feel any necessity to go for alienation or such things to reach to the viewers. he is equally effective despite being conventional. offside (2006), is another schematic creation from him, where gender subordination of middle-east asia gets gradually clear to everybody as the simple but catchy tale of the movie progresses. now-a-days, when all of us are shouting on the issue of rights of women, this movie very calmly creeps into our mind and ultimately becomes a hump for our critical intelligence by conveying the message that the egality of human rights is nothing but an illusive good, an utopia. paternity will never let the women to be empowered. an important soccer match where the nation is participating, a teenage girl who understands the game well, loves her nation does not have the rights to enter into the stadium to cheer for her country. she is merely permitted to listen to the live commentary. her alias could not work for her. as a result, she had to undergo several humiliating situations. from the very beginning her worried father ran here and there for her daughter. at the end of the day, celebration came as the nation won the match which the girl could not see as she was detained in the outer side of the stadium during the match time. but the celebration cannot suppress the question of rights of women which remain in every corner of the world in different format. jafar panahi has most successfully pointed to this issue of gender abuse from with in the frame of conventional film making and patriarchy as well. a global tragedy has been dealt with ease and some times with humour which, in turn, teases our being constantly.
