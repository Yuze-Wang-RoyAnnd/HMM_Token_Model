this is a great movie, i did the play a while ago. it had an extra zing-- to it. i loved vanessa williams as rosey, and also jason alexander has a good voice. it was great. the setting were also very good. except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, makes it pretty long. overall i give it 8.5 stars. they also added a few parts, but it was still cool.
