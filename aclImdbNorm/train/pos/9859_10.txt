ice age is not only animation of the year (in my eyes) it's also the best animated feature i've ever seen!<br /><br />the teaser excited me last year and i've spent many happy hours on the website. scrat is cool! and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes.<br /><br />the animation is superb. your heart really goes out to the characters in this film. they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. it's hard to say which one really steals the picture.<br /><br />i experienced their journey with laughter, tears and amazement. nothing was forced or over done. the emotion was genuine, especially in the dramatic second half. the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in 1997, also a fox production. and before that it was the land before time 1988. all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /><br />
