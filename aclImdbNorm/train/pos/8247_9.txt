as soon as i heard about this film i knew i had to check it out. well, i heard about it, then i found the trailer. after that, that's when i knew i had to see it. and i am so glad i did. you want to see classic television mixed with zombies? no? then get lost.<br /><br />fido is a movie unlike anything i've ever seen. well, actually, it kind of is. it's kind of like a lassie episode and a zombie film. though when combined, it feels completely new and original. fido is about a little boy named timmy and his new pet fido. well this new pet ain't no squawking parakeet or some potty-trained puppy. it's a re-animated dead guy...a zombie. a large radiation cloud engulfed earth which led to all of the dead rising, which ensued the zombie wars. though through the genius of reinhold giger, lead scientist of zomcon, he discovered that if you destroy the brain, the zombie will perish, thus giving us the edge and the win in the zombie war. though due to lingering radiation, whoever dies becomes a zombie. which can be a problem especially with the elderly. though zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs, especially with the domestication collar. the collar stops the zombie's need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet. but not all is perfect in this zombie utopia, collars break, old people die and....well i'll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick.<br /><br />fido is a fantastic idea brought to fruition. with an all-star cast, and great writing fido rises above most in the comedy/horror genre. there are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained. though after seeing the film, i personally think the movie would have been better in black and white. at less than 90 minutes, the movie doesn't go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate. it'll probably end up being a cult-classic of sorts, since it's not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie. it's a comedy/family/zombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe. if you thought anything i said here was interesting by all means check this film out. but if you're still on the fence, swing your leg back over and stay there. 8.5 outta 10
