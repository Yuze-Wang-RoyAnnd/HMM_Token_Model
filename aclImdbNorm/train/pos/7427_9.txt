i saw the trailer for this movie in the 70's when i was barely 16 while viewing another film. oh!!!! how excited me and my best friend were. we couldn't wait for the month or so until it would come on. i saw this movie 17 times that year at the theatre. i love,love,love it. kris is so perfect for the film. he is brash and kinda trashy but also shy and uncertain with babs and it is so endearing to watch it again. when they sing evergreen at the studio and he chimes in with his raspy voice so very different from the perfect notes coming from her but i always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie. the way he looks at her and he is so proud.i could watch this movie every day. we tried to dress like est-her i even have the long sweater and cap that was so like the one she wore. this came on tv on time and i got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to. maybe its just that i was so caught up into it at an age when everything was extreme don't know. the ending always has me in tears even today.
