if you're amused by straight-faced goings-on that are logical within a given illogical situation, you'll enjoy this whimsical 8-minute spanish film.<br /><br />a woman enters a small caf'e. the scene looks ordinary, but the counterman, customers, and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued.<br /><br />suddenly, the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song , dancing across table tops with musical-comedy gestures. the customers, at first immobile, at intervals chime in (badly but gamely) with phrases from the song, read from slips of paper in their palms. on and off they jump up and dance (awkwardly but earnestly) in choreographed motions, like backup singers.<br /><br />but why??? the woman wonders. the answer is revealed as the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's strapped across his chest -- just before the explosive climax...<br /><br />even if you don't catch the song's (probably ironical) lyrics, the situation-perfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle... i'd love to see it again!
