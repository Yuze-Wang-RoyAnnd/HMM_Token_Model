first of all for this movie i just have one word: 'wow'. this is probably, one of the best movies that touched me, from it's story to it's performances, so wonderfully played by sophia loren and marcello mastroianni. i was very impressed with this last one, because he really brought depth to the character, as it was a very hard role. still, the two of them formed a pair, that surprised me, from the beginning until the end, showing in the way, a friendship filled with love, that develops during the entire day, settled in the movie. the story takes some time to roll, as the introduction of the characters is long, but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity. if you have the chance, see it, because it's a movie that will stay in your mind for many time. simply amazing - 9/10.
