something about "paulie" touched my heart as few movies do. it is a witty, funny yet emotional movie. i'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie. i didn't see "paulie" until may, 2004 and have since ordered the widescreen dvd from a seller at ebay.<br /><br />the special effects of showing paulie talking are superb. my son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.probably my favorite part of the movie is when paulie is in gena rowlands (ivy's) company followed by cheech marin (ignacio). tony shalhoub (misha) plays an excellent part as the good hearted human. you root for him all the way through the movie.<br /><br />you can't go wrong renting or buying this movie!!
