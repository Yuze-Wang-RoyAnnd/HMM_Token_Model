wow. saw this last night and i'm still reeling from how good it was. every character felt so real (although most of them petty, selfish a**holes) and the bizarre story - middle aged widow starts shagging her daughter's feckless boyfriend - felt utterly convincing. top performances all round but hats off to anne reid and our friends in the north's daniel craig (the latter coming across as the next david thewlis).<br /><br />and director roger michell? this is as far from notting hill as it's possible to be. thank god.<br /><br />watch this movie!!!
