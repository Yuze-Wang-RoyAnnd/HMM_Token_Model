this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk. the style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it. all you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that i can see) to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination. i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled that's just so unbelievable. what a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to do that.
