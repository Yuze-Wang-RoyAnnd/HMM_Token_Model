written by the writer who penned the excellent murder rooms series which chronicled acd's adventures with doctor joseph bell, i was looking forward to this and i wasn't disappointed. it was quite slow moving, with a lot of emphasis on doyle's frustration at sherlock holmes which was very accurate and excellently portrayed. it was an interesting character study and very well shot ( on digital video, unusual for a period piece ). the acting was excellent all round, particularly tim mcinnery and brian cox although the actor who portrayed acd, whose name i cannot remember impressed me no end. an excellent character study which has about the same amount of twists as any normal sherlock holmes case. do see this if you get the chance
