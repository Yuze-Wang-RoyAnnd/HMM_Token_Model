ghost story,(the new house) is a terrific horror story. this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early seventies.the beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian cabot. remember him from the early family series, family affair in the 1960s? this particular story has barbara parkins and david birney as the lead actors, and as the main characters in the story.i saw this recently,and i was so scared!if you are alone,i would not recommend that you watch this.this story is terrific,no gore or curse words, but very scary. barbara parkins played the young bride. david birney played her husband.both actors were very good in their parts.if you like scary, fun,terrifying ghost stories, then you will like this little gem. i gave this a high rating.i highly recommend this story.
