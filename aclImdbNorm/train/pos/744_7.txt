"foxes" is one movie i remember for it's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970's. as i am exactly jodie foster's age, i related to this movie. it deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships & rebellion of youth. the soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg. "more than a feeling" by boston and sad numbers like "on the radio" by donna summer. the music of my late teens. yep, i'll always remember this one, even if it wasn't huge.
