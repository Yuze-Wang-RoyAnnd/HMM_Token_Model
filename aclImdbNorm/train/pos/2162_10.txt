i was so surprised when i saw this film so much underrated... i understand why some of you dislike this movie. its pace is slow, a characteristic of japanese films. nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will find this not a problem at all.<br /><br />i must say this is the best comedy i have ever seen. "shall we dansu?" is often considered a masterpiece of japanese comedies. it is very different from hollywood ones, e.g. austin powers or scary movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. rather, it is light-hearted, a movie that makes you feel good.<br /><br />i love the movie because it makes me feel "real". the plot is straightforward yet pleasing. i was so delighted seeing that sugiyama (the main role) has found the meaning of life in dancing. before i watched the film i was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork. i felt lost. however, this film made me think of the bright side of life. i believed i was in the same boat of sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't i? it reminded me of "exploring my own future" and discovering the happiness in my daily life.<br /><br />it is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. while some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, i kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive", learning to dance as the film goes on.<br /><br />over all, this film is encouraging and heart-warming. as a comedy, it does its job perfectly. it definitely deserves 10 stars.<br /><br />and yes aoki is funny :-d
