but the rest of us, who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying..enjoy! <br /><br />tom hulce is magnificent as dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, eugene, played by ray liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long hours. <br /><br />due to eugene's work schedule, dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls. he really just wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing, and to make his brother proud of him. he stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started. <br /><br />not about to give anything away here, but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking. those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, its loving characters and a great song i cannot quote here, that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriate..but you hear it in a bar.<br /><br />i thought tom hulce would be nominated for this movie, since he was for 'amadeus' i figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning. no such luck. liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact, but then he does later on. all i can say about jamie lee curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget.
