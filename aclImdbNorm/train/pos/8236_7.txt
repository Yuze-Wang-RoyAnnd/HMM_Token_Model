due to the invention of a "the domestication collar", flesh-eating zombies are brought under control, and become productive members of society; however, they perform menial tasks. the servile dead attend to those living in fenced us 1950s-styled small towns, while untamed zombies roam around in "the wild zone". in the town of "willard", pre-teen k'sun ray (as timmy robinson) lives with parents carrie-anne moss and dylan baker (as helen and bill robinson). alas, the robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie; their new neighbors, the bottoms, have six. so, to keep up, the robinsons obtain zombie billy connolly (as fido).<br /><br />unfortunately, mr. connolly's "domestication collar" is damaged by an old lady's walker, and he eats her; then, new and hungry zombies infest the town. meanwhile, young ray has grown attached to connolly (the boy and his zombie are like tv's "timmy and lassie") and, the robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling "zomcom" authorities. <br /><br />"fido" doesn't go far enough into its own intriguing "wild zone"; but, it is a colorful, stylish, and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore. ray and the cast perform well, individually; with nubile zombie sonja bennett (as tammy) and owner tim blake nelson (as theopolis) the most memorable pair. director andrew currie and crew, including rob gray (design), jan kiesser (photography), don macdonald (music), and james willcock (design), deservedly won awards.<br /><br />******* fido (2006) andrew currie ~ k'sun ray, carrie-anne moss, billy connolly, dylan baker
