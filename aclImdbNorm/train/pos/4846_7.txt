this is a classic british comedy-thriller i had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had arisen for that until now. it's based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously (most notably in 1931 by the same director but, unfortunately, this version seems not to have survived in its entirety!); for the remake under review, the plot has been updated to the then-current wartime situation.<br /><br />anyway, i was mainly familiar with early british comedians through the films of will hay: given that this one features a similar plot of legendary hauntings, smuggling and enemy agents, it's very much in that vein (it was actually scripted by hay's regular writing team of marriott edgar, val guest and j.o.c. orton); the stranded travelers element, then, was an equally tried-and-true formula. the star this time around is arthur askey (abetted by richard murdoch) - none of whose films i had watched before - who is as unlikely a hero as hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating...but one soon warms up to him, and askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play (and the 1931 film version) was split into two here, with murdoch acting as the star's straight partner.<br /><br />the remote single setting (the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night) provides for some wonderful atmosphere; the last half-hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (raymond huntley and linden travers) and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is especially gripping and well handled. also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is kathleen harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster, with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink.
