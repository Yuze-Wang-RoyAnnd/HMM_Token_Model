ok, this movie was cool. i don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun. my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in. enjoyable all the way until the end, but a great concept. this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy. judgment is victory for robot jox.
