this is just about in the same league as `the black cat', although i'd give this a 9 rather than a 9+. that's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing!<br /><br />`the invisible ray' is part horror, part drama and certainly part sci-fi. for a movie made in 1936 the sci-fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time. the mixture of horror, drama and sci-fi are a perfect blend, while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldn't be better.<br /><br />director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often. what i'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot. the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood. it's a standout moment in the film, which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre.<br /><br />as with `the black cat' and `island of lost souls', i can't understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd. when you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to dvd it's that much more puzzling.<br /><br />anyway, watch this film if you get the chance. when it's released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library.
