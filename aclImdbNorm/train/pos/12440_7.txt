recap: it's business as usual at louche's casino in tanger. the casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day. the owner louche and some staff leave for the night, leaving modesty in charge. suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino, shooting wildly. unknown to modesty, they have already killed louche, and are now after the money hidden in the vault. but no one present, and still alive, at the casino knows the code to open the vault. the vault itself is heavily booby trapped with explosives so the assailants can't blow the door as planned. suddenly modesty finds herself eye to eye with the gangsters' leader miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in jeopardy.<br /><br />comments: this is a review written with no connection what so ever with other published media about modesty blaise, as i have neither seen nor read any of it. the first point i like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified. foremost i thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between modesty and miklos as the main plot. sure, there are some bursts of action but they are not really an integral or important part of the story.<br /><br />as already mentioned the main plot and the main suspense-filled scene, is the game between modesty and miklos. it's an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character, and in doing so much of the story takes place outside the casino at a much earlier time. someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a tv-series, and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such. but, i felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done. i was in no way disappointed in the lack of action, instead i enjoyed this game, the history much more than a simple action movie.<br /><br />i think the two main stars, alexandra staden and nikolaj coaster-waldau did very well. staden especially portrays modesty very well, and really carries this confident and talented character.<br /><br />7/10
