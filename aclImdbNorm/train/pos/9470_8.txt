i'm not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan, an advice columnist, who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. its a story thats been told before, but not like this. there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be. the cast is wonderful, and even if carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as the widower who's suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you. at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be, the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film. worth a look see
