"one shot, one kill, no exceptions." a must see if you are into marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! great overall storyline, great camera work, good drama, action, details, and more. pretty close to the real thing. but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults. this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins. the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think. its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action. sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie. tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life. the plain of dealing with all of the death. must see for sniper fans.
