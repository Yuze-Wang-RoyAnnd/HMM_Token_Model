this is one of the best movie i have ever seen. my parents comes from rural india and to some extend i have seen the life of the villagers. peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /><br />the movie just reflects exactly the same. full credit to the director and the actor. they have done an excellent job. i just wonder how can movies like lagaan and paheli can go for oscar and not doghi. i don't understand the criteria on which the movies are selected. is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the difference.<br /><br />hope to see more movies like this in the future.
