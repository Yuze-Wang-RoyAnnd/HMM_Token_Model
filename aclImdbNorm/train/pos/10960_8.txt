i really can't remember who recommended this, but they said it was one of their favorite films. it is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident.<br /><br />someone said that truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth here is something to see. i really can't understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year. how can you improve on this? the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton's. in the process they become recluses and what is best described as "crazy cat ladies." they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie. this film was done after that rescue. all during, you couldn't help but think, "how bad was it before?" it's a look at high society from the darker side, and it is utterly fascinating.
