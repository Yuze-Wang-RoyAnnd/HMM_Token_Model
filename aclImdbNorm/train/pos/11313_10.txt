gino costa (massimo girotti) is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar. he meets the young, beautiful and unsatisfied wife giovanna bragana (clara calamai) and her old and fat husband giuseppe bragana (juan de landa), owners of the bar. he trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging, and has an affair with giovanna. they both decide to kill giuseppe, forging a car accident. the relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police. this masterpiece ends in a tragic way. the noir and neo-realistic movie of luchino visconti is outstanding. this is the first time that i watch this version of `the postman always rings twice'. i loved the 1946 version with lana turner, and the 1981 version, where jack nicholson and jessica lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema, but this one is certainly the best. my vote is ten.
