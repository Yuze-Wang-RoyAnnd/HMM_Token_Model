herbet clutter, wife bonnie, and their teenage children kenyon and nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of holcomb, kansas--but in the early hours of 14 november 1959 all four were brutally murdered. rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on author truman capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion. the result was the book in cold blood. controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well-written, it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day.<br /><br />the 1967 film version of capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. filmed in black and white in many of the real-life locations, it has a slightly documentary quality, icy and detached--and the overall cast is exceptional. this is the film on which robert blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so. as killer perry smith, blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; it is a masterful performance from start to finish. as richard hickock, scott wilson is no less fine.<br /><br />like capote's book, the film opens with smith and hickock as they travel to kansas and brings them to the clutter home--only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction. the centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the clutter home; actually filmed in the clutter house itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, horrific and deeply disturbing.<br /><br />director and writer richard brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy. given the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance. strong stuff--and recommended.<br /><br />gft, amazon reviewer
