so i flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought i'd pass a half hour watching "girlfight" while waiting for "hart's war" to start. with a title like that i figured it was some exploitation 'b' flic about inner city girl gangs.<br /><br />much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all. instead it is a well acted, well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. she is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts. as he doesn't really want to be a boxer (only following through on their father's wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead. <br /><br />the story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest. for starters, her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer. after grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. yes, a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot, coming across more of an interesting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences.<br /><br />all in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of. some time later when i saw the much advertised and acclaimed "million dollar baby" i thought "wait a minute, this seems kind of familiar". needless to say, i didn't watch "hart's war" that night.
