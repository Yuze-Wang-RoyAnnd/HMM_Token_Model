i suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay. i thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called "the fear:halloween night". i expected this movie to be somewhat of a halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy. but it opened with a good scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people(including his mother) and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit. pretty good for a sequel and i never even seen the first.
