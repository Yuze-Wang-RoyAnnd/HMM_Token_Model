this was the first "walking tall" movie i saw, i think in a $2 movie theater along hollywood blvd. , so i didn't have any reference to the first installment done by joe don baker. i remember being shocked at the corrupted system of mcnairy county and the brutality of the "redneck gangs". i was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he's not going to let it slide, and went out to do something about it. courageous ? i thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine.<br /><br />i think this movie is a great story about american courage to stand up and do something about a system that's only serving its own interest. i was pretty blown away about it, and think this is still one of the best movie of the hero/anti-hero genre, which one might laugh but includes recent movies like the "the punisher", but even more so because it's a true story. the recent remake starring the "rock" just doesn't do any justice to the real fire in the story of buford pusser.<br /><br />a "classic" that i'm sure will resurface again in the future.
