i am sad to say that i disagree with other people on this columbo episode. death lends a hand is frankly kind of a boring columbo to me. after a few times, i get bored and changed the channel. i still love robert culp and patricia crowley and ray milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. first, robert culp plays an investigator for ray milland's character. he hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by patricia crowley to see if she is having an affair. in return, culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career. out of anger, culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. i don't know. maybe i just didn't care for this one at all. of course, columbo gets him in the end. it's just the question of how.
