the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo. but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion.<br /><br />the excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill, suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws. the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before.<br /><br />the biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation. the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end.<br /><br />good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then. apart from the filthy language/parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes, the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years.
