the movie never claims to be something spectacular like many films do. the films props itself as a fun and entertaining time. and that's exactly what it was. it is the korean version of a male bring it on.<br /><br />from the get go you can feel for the rest of the film and how it will end but the enjoyment is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the film is a carbon copy of another. instead, the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the 2 remaining "thugs" came to be men in their own right. therefore, the film is fun and entertaining.<br /><br />the camera work, specially the dolly moves were very well executed. the script, being a tad weak, was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire. this film will not win any oscars, nor any dvd blockbuster sales, but a fun watch and a fun experience.
