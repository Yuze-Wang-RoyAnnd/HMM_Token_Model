while it certainly wasn't the best movie i've ever seen, it was certainly worth the $8 (which can't be said for many movies these days.)<br /><br />this was a pleasant account of a true story, although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie, (ie, billy sunday's character was three or four people in the real story combined together.) robert deniro was of course good, and cuba gooding, jr., was also impressive.
