this show is awesome. i thought that the two episodes where paul died were so sad; i actually cried. but the other shows were awesome; kerry was my favorite character, because she was in "the dark side." i also thought that bridget was funny because she was all perky. i also thought that guy who played kyle was really, really cute. i loved it when kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. the guy who played rory was cute, and paul, played by john ritter, was really funny. this whole entire tv show is funny, and i wish they still showed it on tv. when they did show it on tv, though, i watched it every single time it was on. the next time it shows, i will watch it over and over again.
