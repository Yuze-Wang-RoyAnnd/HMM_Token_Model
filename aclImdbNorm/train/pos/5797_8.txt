and i don't say it in a bad way.<br /><br />i watched this movie at the cinema when i was 6 or 7. for me and my cousins it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. when we left the theatre, michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it.<br /><br />over the years, i saw this movie being aired a few times but i always changed the channel. even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart. and i liked it that way.<br /><br />so i've only seen this movie once and i believe it was a good decision not to watch it again. if i saw it today, i know i couldn't help but criticise mj's acting, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. for me this is a childhood memory, so my feelings towards it are those of a child from 20 years ago.<br /><br />i see my adult self intervenes in my rating and gives it an 8 for the memories and wonderful music. for that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though, this is definitely worthy of a 10.
