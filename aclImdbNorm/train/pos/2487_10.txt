i must say that, looking at hamlet from the perspective of a student, brannagh's version of hamlet is by far the best. his dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded. it helps the play come to life on screen, and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching, as we did while studying it, to follow and analyze the text.<br /><br />one of the things i have heard criticized many times is the casting of major hollywood names in the play. i find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier, as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with shakespeare.<br /><br />also, his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text. such as how far the relationship between hamlet and ophelia really went and why fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end. all in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with shakespeare. it is presented in a way that one does not have to be an english literature ph.d to understand and enjoy it.
