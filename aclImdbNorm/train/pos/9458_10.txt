this is a sublime piece of film-making. it flows at just the right pace throughout. the accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. the humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely depressingly tragic nature of the film.<br /><br />however, despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch. i thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that i haven't experienced for a long time. that is to say, it is superb and yet without all the common trappings of modern films such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /><br />'dan in real life' lacks nothing for being without the regular vices. it has a fully matured plot that just doesn't require, and indeed would be ruined by, any further embellishment. at the same time, the theme is entirely adult. it's a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers.<br /><br />there are some scenes that feel a bit 'waltons' but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments. the rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the idyllic which turns to the darker etc. this undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. the peaks and troughs are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill.<br /><br />i highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy. put aside any prejudices because this is a must see!
