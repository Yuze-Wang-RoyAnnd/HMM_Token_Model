this is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time. it has all the right ingredients - a mystery corpse, a weary middle-aged cop corrigan (walter kinsella) and his rookie sidekick tobin (john miles), a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the tobin in the shape of a female botanist mary (patricia wright) who helps solve the crime. there's also a terrific shoot-out finale which takes place in a stone cutters yard.<br /><br />watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where lt. corrigan refers to the dead woman as 'tatooed tilly' before the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo (confusing huh?). also later when tobin is chasing the killer across the back yards he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he didn't catch him!
