this movie is very entertaining, and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality. other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy, the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor. it has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes.<br /><br />as a finder of lost children, murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl, which leads him on the path for which others believe he was "chosen" - - to protect the golden child. the young boy is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose very life is in danger, if not for the help of murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector.<br /><br />also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts. one such scene is where the golden child, that murphy's character is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice.<br /><br />this is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware. as we accept this premise of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality, and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away, and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us.<br /><br />this is an excellent movie, with a good plot, fine acting, and for the most part, pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting, and eddie murphy humor.
