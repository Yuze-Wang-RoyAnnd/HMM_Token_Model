***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** packed with memorable moments (such as the quote above, immortalized by primus), deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild woods to go white water rafting and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn. this is not a hollywood film. there are virtually no special effects whatsoever, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty. the city boys look like city boys, and even the tough guy louis, portrayed with precision by burt reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip. this is a perfect example of a what-if film. what if a few friends went river rafting in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with, and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives?<br /><br />there is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. when the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film, they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there, and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate. this communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene, in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downriver for them. while drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), louis is having some difficulty buying the gas, and bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is. when the boy turns away from drew, who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session, bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks, knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react.<br /><br />this is the kind of thing that we see in deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow. this great scene where a lot of fun was had (including the funniest 'redneck dancing' scene until o brother, where art thou?) ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other. these people are apples and oranges, and they live by completely different rules of life. the people that louis, bobby, drew and ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, which do not include thou shalt not kill. confused by their awkward behavior, the four friends set out on the river, hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin.<br /><br />(spoilers) when they are briefly separated from each other and ed and bobby run into the hillbillies beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant, the uncertainty about the way that these people live - which was established by the scene above - comes into play to create the most tension during the scene. i think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film, namely the assaults and actual murders, takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film. there is no gratuitous violence here, it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a startlingly powerful effect.<br /><br />the move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people, and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other. the trip down the rest of the river after the assault, which takes up the majority of the film, delivers some spectacularly effective tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much happening that you become numb. it is surprisingly effective when we find out that ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff, and the tension in the film doesn't even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river, because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing.<br /><br />this is a very disturbing film, which is a testament to its success, because it's pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit. the hillbillies are the human (i.e. more realistic) version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childish but fairly similar films like gator bait and gator bait 2, neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like deliverance. when we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that it's almost like we, as individuals of the audience, are really a fifth member of the team. it's not often that a film is able to come across that way.
