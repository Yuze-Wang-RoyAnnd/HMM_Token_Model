the industry dropped the ball on this. the trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens. had people had an opportunity to see this, work of mouth would have made it very successful. the 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters. i checked this out based on the rave recommendation richard roeper or (ebert and roeper) in his book. an example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens. which gave it no chance to be seen. some movies go to video quickly because they aren't that good. this is oscar worthy and it's a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it. maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on dvd or cable. if you haven't see this movie you should. great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie. it could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films. girl interrupted comes to mind. if you like that you will like this. <br /><br />both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic. even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic. the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school. erica is even better in this than in traffic. i hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine. see this movie and if you like, recommend to friends so it doesn't get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year. this movie was buried while spiderman 2 tops records. what kind of word are we living in? aghhh. so to make the world right again see this and recommend it.
