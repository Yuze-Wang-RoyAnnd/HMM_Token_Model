i rented this film from netflix for two reasons - i was in the mood for what i thought would be a silly '50s sci-fi-asco and because it is the first feature-length superman film. needless to say, after about 15 minutes i found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />an experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor. lois and clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation. a day later, strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for superman than clark kent. it seems that the radioactive mole men have invaded from their six-mile deep home near the earth's core.<br /><br />supermen and the mole men is a simplistic but well-made piece of social realism. released in 1951, starring a lead actor who served in world war ii, the moral of the story seems to be that americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else. to drive this point home in a typically straightforward superman manner, reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the mole men of being 'nazis' at one point.<br /><br />even in the 1950s, the science underlying this film was nonexistent. six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle, let alone the "hollow center of the earth" - which, in any case does not exist. forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book.<br /><br />the film is a little unevenly paced. although the molemen are interesting, a bit creepy, and nicely portrayed, there are several corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior. the script is intelligent and economical. by today's standards, the costuming is poor to fair, but for its time, this film's special effects and costuming were quite good. the cinematography is also generally very good, and the acting is much better than one might expect. i was particularly impressed with reeves, jeff corey and walter reed.
