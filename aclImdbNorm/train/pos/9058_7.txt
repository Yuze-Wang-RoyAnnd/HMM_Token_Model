i read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later i saw the movie. there are a few differences: <br /><br />1.billy was oringinally suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in one day by 7:00pm.<br /><br />2.billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms. in the movie after billy eats all the worms, joe has to go to school with worms in his pants.<br /><br />3. joe is suppose to fake some of the worms but in the movie, he doesn't at all.<br /><br />even though there are changes,this movie is still one that kids will enjoy.
