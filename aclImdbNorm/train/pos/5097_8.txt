this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it isn't on any of her collections.the reason why is probably because it doesn't have a happy ending,unlike all her other films.its also not a musical,although she does belt out one song called' the world owes me a living'.the film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white,the version i have is in colour and on vhs,i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic,unlike i would say the colourised films of laurel and hardy which are dreadful.the film is good for its age and the story hasn't dated at all,i'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake.at times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out, in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five.although don't be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it,especially when {jerry}gary cooper steals a necklace,and hides it in shirley's teddy bear.the tension and slow build up to his actions,{while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room}is very well directed.gary and caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good.in all this is a good film from the early 30's,accept it for its age.
