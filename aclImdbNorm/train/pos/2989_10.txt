first off, i would just like to say what a big fan of bette midler's i am. stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast (bette midler, john goodman, trini alvarado, stephen collins, marsha mason) this is one of my favorite films of all time. it deals with a mother raising a child on her own, she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter jenny played wonderfully by trini alvarado. this movie is very good and i suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it. roger ebert gave is 3 1/2 stars! and it deserved 4! wonderful! i give it 4 out of 4!
