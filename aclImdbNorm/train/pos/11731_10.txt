i think that this movie is very fun and horror. i love elvira and i like this movie. it's very pity that second part of this wonderful movie had no success, because it very funny like a first part. i also regret that besides of this movie i have no seen cassandra peterson in other films.i think that she is amazing actress with big...potential. i hope that ii'll see her in future in the third part of elvira's adventures. cassandra peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses. cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. you can rely on me. what can i more add? this is cool and classical movie!
