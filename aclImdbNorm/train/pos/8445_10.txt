homicide: the movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted series. loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season. the entire series, and especially the movie, provided a life-like look at life (and death) in baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore, but once i experienced life here for myself, i realized how realistic it was. and the movie certainly retained that spirit. i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series, but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city.
