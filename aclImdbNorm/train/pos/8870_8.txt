when john singleton is on, he's *on*!! and this is one of his better films. not quite as tight as boyz-n-the-hood, but close to it (and with much of the same stellar cast). this film was very well written, very well put together, and very well shot. there's very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (eg: where did fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff? no mention of a rich background... and why doesn't professor phibbs have an office? a professor of his stature *should* have one... and while we're at it, for an engineering student, hick or not, remy's a pretty dumb character - i'd think that he'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence - he talks and acts like a total buffoon).<br /><br />but that aside, the film was very sharp. a good array of characters and points of view; and singleton doesn't take sides in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic, and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides.<br /><br />much of the cinematography was excellent; i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well. also the malik/deja scenes were really well shot as well.<br /><br />the dialogue was a bit much at times; this film had a tendency to get *really* preachy at times, and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness (we really didn't need the us flag with 'unlearn' typed onto it, give some credit, we're not morons...). and to top it off, although *most* of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well, sometimes it gets *way* too cheezy (like deja's death, which is fine until she screams out 'why!!!' which simply ruined the entire effect and scene).<br /><br />but the acting, in general, was top of the line. fabulous performances by omar epps (perhaps the best i've ever seen), kirsty swanson (who knew buffy could act??), michael rapaport (surprised the hell out of me...after true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a one-role actor), and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are *always* outstanding.<br /><br />downside? jennifer connelly was flat; though it's not completely her fault: her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional. generic to the highest degree. and tyra banks, who had the role, was nothing short of horrid. she whined and whined and whined. yet another in the long line of models-turned-actresses who failed miserably (though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule).<br /><br />finally, the soundtrack! wow! an amazing soundtrack (which is definitely worth buying!) which fits the film like a glove. each scene has a twin song (although the tori amos songs started to *really* annoy me by the end...not her best work). liz phair, rage against the machine, ice cube...how can one go wrong??<br /><br />all in all: a really good watch, a really strong cast, great script, great film. 8/10.
