as we all know the sub-genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. i've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days.<br /><br />coming into the 40 year old virgin i knew basically what to expect; i did see the commercials after all; "is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?" what i didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. there's still the weird "off-the-wall" characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink noah's ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message.<br /><br />the main character andy is (unfortunately for me) a person i can relate to. in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities. andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. most importantly of all; andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them. combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. it's like my life story.<br /><br />the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does. i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie.<br /><br />i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light. the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go; it's quite simple. it deals with andy's relationship with trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end. sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end, and i assure you it does. these are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that i can easily ignore it's few faults.<br /><br />when i say "good" i mean "bad" of course. this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. for the most part i think it succeeded. there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish. or the scene where andy goes with his trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence "ooh! como se llama!" an interesting little note about that scene; the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.<br /><br />actually since we're talking about steve carell, i'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. i was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. this man has talent it the 40 year old virgin proves that.<br /><br />to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see. i'm glad that i did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching. it's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance. now excuse me while i go puke my guts out; i can't believe i just wrote that...<br /><br />my review from frider waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
