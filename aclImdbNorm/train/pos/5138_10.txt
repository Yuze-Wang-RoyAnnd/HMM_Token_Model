back in 1994, i had a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. i stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents' house a lot.<br /><br />i didn't have a tv in my apartment so i used to watch my parents' tube. i had just finished watching a segment of the x files when a program came on called personal fx. i was hooked instantly. i had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc.<br /><br />after my long vacation, i used to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours just to catch personal fx.<br /><br />i can remember one episode during which co-host claire carter announced that the new york apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that personl fx would return to the air.<br /><br />it never did! personal fx was the first -and best - of the collectible shows. and it vanished from the air! almost fifteen years later, i'm still sore.<br /><br />way to go, fx.
