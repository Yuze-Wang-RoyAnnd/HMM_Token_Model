the bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion! these characteristics of idealistic imagery which "moonstruck" possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in hollywood. let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are "yesteryear". "moonstruck" is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old italian neighborhood in new york city. new york city has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical new yorkers, this includes a lot of italian americans living in new york as well! the mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes. ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in american history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made. these generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable! for this italian family of a bygone era, confusion, indecisiveness, agitation, and yes, of course, love, all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them! the kindred spirits with everyone in "moonstruck" seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties. one might wonder about cher playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie. in "moonstruck", however, i think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation. all of the characters in "moonstruck" are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity. the most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose! i thought the acting in this movie was sensational. all relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like!! for this family, nothing is glamorous, nothing is pretentiously romantic, and nothing is overly emotional (just moderately so). the fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives. taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore'. thus signifying everything!! the homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; be honest, get angry; be honest, get confrontational; be honest, get distorted and emphatic; most importantly; be honest, and fall in love!! this is cher's best performance ever as an actress!! nicholas cage, danny aiello, and olympia dukakis, were wonderfully flawed in "moonstruck" such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie! director, norman jewison (famous for "cincinnati kid", "thomas crowne affair", and most famous for "in the heat of the night" which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film! i am italian american in descent, (partially anyways) cher is not italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director! i guess since non-italians like eating our food, they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too! it is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending!! for those of you who didn't like this movie, i just have one thing to say "snap out of it!!" this movie "moonstruck" is totally happy go lucky!! totally eighties!! and totally five stars!! see it!!
