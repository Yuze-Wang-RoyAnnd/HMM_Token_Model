i have watched this movie on dvd a couple of times now,the first time, i watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour. an engrossing entertaining film, thank god no kiera knightley in it, refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of queen victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. nothing bad about the movie at all, no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing. might prompt the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as conroy and lord melbourne
