i think the movie was pretty good, will add it to my "clasic collection" after all this time. i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie. maybe some of the more esoteric points defy "logic", but a great many religious matters accepted "on faith" fail to pass the smell test. if you're going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie. is it just me or has anyone else noticed the aja-yee dagger is the same possessed knife lamonte cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in "the shadow". no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here (imdb), but i would bet a dollar to a donut it's the same prop.
