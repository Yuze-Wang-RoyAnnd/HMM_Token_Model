louise brooks gives a wonderful performance in this well-made french melodrama. she plays a typist named lucienne who, despite being in love with a man named andre, dreams of rising above her position in life. she sees opportunity in a beauty contest for miss europe, but andre is furious when he discovers that she's entered, then demands that she withdraw. she tries to take back her entry only to discover that she's already been chosen as miss france and will now go on to the main pageant.<br /><br />this is a story of love, loss and decision played out to its passionate end. the movie is very energetically filmed by director augusto genina and cinema tographers rudolf mate and louis nee. the filming style is more like modern movies than the hollywood flicks of the '30s, and shows the different style employed by europeans. there are many fast cuts and traveling shots, mostly done with great skill and verve. the high energy of the movie's first third dwindles a bit in the middle but picks up again in the last 15 minutes.<br /><br />the performances were very good by all the principals, but that of louise brooks is especially memorable. louise leans heavily on her silent screen skills even though this is a talkie, but because her silent style had a surprisingly contemporary, understated feel, she makes the transition to talkies very well. the long early scene at the fair was especially poignant as louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation, of being trapped in a life she no longer wants. i doubt it's ever been done better.<br /><br />the film builds to a superb finale, artfully shot, powerful and stylish. this is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film. and the tragic storyline only underscores the greater tragedy that this is the final starring role for louise brooks. she wasn't just a great beauty who looked fantastic in a swimsuit, she really was a major acting talent who basically threw it all away. we are all the poorer for that.<br /><br />this movie is less well known than her german films with g.w. pabst, but i think it's a better one. i think this crew is just better at storytelling than pabst, and while prix de beaute may lack the deep moral complexity of the pabst films, it's much easier to follow and is overall a more streamlined, focused piece of work. and it doesn't hurt that louise's singing parts are done by edith piaf, either.<br /><br />bottom line, this is a classic louise brooks film well worth looking for.
