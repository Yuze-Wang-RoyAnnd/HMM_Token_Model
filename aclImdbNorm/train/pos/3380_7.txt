i've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s; some horrendously bad, and others thought provoking and truly frightening. soylent green fits into the latter category. yes, at times it's a little campy, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but some of the film seems awfully prescient. here we have a film, 9 years before blade runner, that dares to imagine the future as somthing dark, scary, and nihilistic. both charlton heston and edward g. robinson fare far better in this than the ten commandments, and robinson's assisted-suicide scene is creepily prescient of kevorkian and his ilk. some of the attitudes are dated (can you imagine a filmmaker getting away with the "women as furniture" concept in our oh-so-politically-correct-90s?), but it's rare to find a film from the me decade that actually can make you think. this is one i'd love to see on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation, i don't think the overall scope of this film would receive its due. check it out.
