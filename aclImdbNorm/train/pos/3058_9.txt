i bought this a year or more ago for $2 (yep, $2), left it on the shelf for ages, now watching dvds while holed up with a cold.<br /><br />this is a haunting movie. brilliant performances by all involved, especially the 6yo boy (about the only smiles you get in this movie).<br /><br />plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever, grosse pointe blank, but obviously that's lighthearted, this is heavy hearted.<br /><br />as a psychologist, a clinical and forensic psychologist, a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed. scary stuff! brilliant work all round.<br /><br />pete
