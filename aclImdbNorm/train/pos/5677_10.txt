the 3rd and in my view the best of the blackadder series.<br /><br />the only downside is that there is no lord percy who was the funniest character from the previous series but hugh laurie's prince regent is suitably madcap laugh a line.<br /><br />as a package it's quality through and through with convincing regency sets, superb cutting sarcasm and little bits of the wacky, the 'macbeth' actors standing out and prince georges 'lucky us' chicken impression, and the missing words from dr johnson's dictionary.<br /><br />few comedies have been quite as both clever as they are funny, okay the odd lame observation or line gets in but mostly it's a scream.
