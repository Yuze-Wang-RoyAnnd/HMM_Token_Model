this is a film about 17th century italian artists and one artist in particular, a woman artemisia, an unheard of profession for females at that time, and she dared to paint the male nude detailing his unique musculature.<br /><br />the camera work is principally indoors for that is where the artists mainly worked. there are some great shots. close-ups by candle light suggest the beautiful work of the classical painters and it is fascinating to watch the painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding brushing in details of religious frescoes. it is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes,faces, make-up) are quite superbly authentic because the italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries. the beautiful artemisia is urged by her father to study under the great florentine artist, tassi, who has become expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new) but the unsuspecting artemisia is introduced to more than new techniques in painting. after posing for her, tassi violently rapes her. her father is outraged. court proceedings follow.<br /><br />this romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. the outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. scenes such as women running across a field with the wind billowing their voluminous clothing add wonderful effects.<br /><br />artemisia says she paints to please herself; her father paints to please others. as for this film, it will please most, i think.
