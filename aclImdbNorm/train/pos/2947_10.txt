if you haven't seen this, you do not know what you are missing. the first time you do, you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard, and having probably wet yourself as well.<br /><br />it is that funny. there hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that i have seen that tops this or even comes close. so many classic one liners, stories, and segways..<br /><br />the drunken uncle at the bbq, gi joe, mr t, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and i'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter, or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act.<br /><br />pure classic!! shame you can't get it on dvd..<br /><br />rating 10+ out of 10
