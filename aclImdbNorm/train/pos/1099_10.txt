although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built (or bought) to your specifications, it is not the first, nor the last. in 1940 jack benny and ann sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy george washington slept here by george s. kaufman and moss hart. and about fifteen years ago shelly long and tom hanks had the lead in the money pit. the former was about moving into an 18th century country house that...err, needs work. the latter was about building your dream house - in the late 1980s. although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as blandings, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name.<br /><br />jim blandings and his wife muriel (cary grant and myrna loy) are noticing the tight corners of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters joan and betsy (sharyn moffett and connie marshall). although blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 he is making $15,000.00 a year, which was like making $90,000.00 today), and lives in a luxury apartment - which in the new york city of that day he rents! - he feels they should seek something better. he and muriel take a drive into the country (connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want.<br /><br />and they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to. for one thing, they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise, if cynical friend and lawyer bill cole (melvin douglas, in a nicely sardonic role). for example, jim buys land from a connecticut dealer (ian wolfe, sucking his chops quietly), with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of connecticut. bill points out he's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth. there are problems about water supply that both blandings just never think about, such as hard and soft water - which leads to the zis - zis water softening machine. they find that the designs they have in mind, and have worked out with their architect (reginald denny), can't be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for. <br /><br />the escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils jim. he has been appointed to handle the "wham" account ("spam" had become a popular result of world war ii, in that the public started using it as a meat substitute, in the light of it's success with the armed forces). jim can't get a grip on this (he's not alone - one or two other executives fumbled it before him). he comes up with the following bit of "poetry"(?):<br /><br />"this little piggy went to market,<br /><br />he was pink and as pretty as ham.<br /><br />he smiled in his tracks,<br /><br />as they gave him the ax -<br /><br />he knew he would end up as "wham"!"<br /><br />his secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one!<br /><br />jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of bill to muriel, although (in this case) bill is blameless. but he's always around (jim keeps forgetting that bill is the clearheaded one, and that he's keeping jim and muriel from making so many mistakes). all three have mishaps, the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house, just as the men have left for the day. they can't open the door, and jim (in a panic) tries breaking the door down by a make-shift battering ram. he breaks a window, and the door opens by itself.<br /><br />the film works quite satisfactorily, with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves. it is one film which (despite changing price levels and salary levels) really does not age at all. after all, most americans dream of owning their own home and always have.<br /><br />a number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with myrna loy and emory parnell regarding the paint job parnell's company has to do on the various rooms. she carefully shows the distinct shades of red, blue, etc. she wants - even giving a polite parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue. the commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job. they proudly called loy "mrs. blandings" in the commercials' introduction. you can imagine though how the no-nonsense parnell handles the situation afterward, when loy leaves him with his paint crew.
