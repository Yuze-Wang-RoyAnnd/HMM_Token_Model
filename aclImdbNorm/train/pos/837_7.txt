"the matador" is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow, happily-married american businessman (greg kinnear) in mexico. although the sardonic julian (ironically surnamed "noble") appears to be a "tough guy" on the surface, underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities, a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless. thus on his birthday, he reaches out to danny, a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by julian's "unconventional" lifestyle. in fact, both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter, franker moments of self-evaluation.<br /><br />although the film is a bit too reminiscent of "analyze this" and "midnight run" to feel entirely fresh and original, "the matador," nevertheless, earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting. brosnan, looking aged and almost used up, sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never has before. playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being, brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment, then genuine and sympathetic the next. he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale. kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian deepens. hope davis does a fine job as "bean," danny's loyal and loving wife who, like her husband, finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and "dangerous" figure from a world far different from the one she knows.<br /><br />at times, we find ourselves feeling that "the matador" is holding something back from us, not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise. at the end it feels a little too light, a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should. this could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director richard shephard, and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet. still, one appreciates the fact that he doesn't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece, rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh.<br /><br />'the matador" is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will, hopefully, signal a new phase in brosnan's acting career.
