this was a great movie with a good story. my children (10, 7, 5, and 4) all loved this movie, including myself. the music was also fantastic. no, the horses do not talk, but instead, the story is told by spirit. and to hear a story told by a horse's point if view was fun.<br /><br />i think the title says it all, "spirit". this movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. i would have to say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie, and even got so into it, they laughed so hard, and they cheered for spirit in the end. <br /><br />enjoy "spirit" with your family and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story. your kids will love it. i think you will too.
