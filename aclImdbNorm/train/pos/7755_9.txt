"written on the wind" is an irresistible, wonderfully kinky film, as only director sirk could have done it. the movie is submerged in a bucket full of freudian symbols, weird melodramatics and colorful contrasts. the connection between financial success and moral decay is the film's main theme. sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. however, i prefer to see the movie as a prime example of what sirk could do with kitschy material. the palette of colors is particularly impressive. the acting in the film is great too. rock hudson and lauren bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the movie belongs to robert stack and dorothy malone (she deservedly won the best supporting actress oscar), who manage to keep the film at a boiling point. kudos to frank skinner's pulsating score, russell metty's brilliant camera work (every single shot is a masterpiece in itself), and the production design department. also, the title tune is a beauty. it's an unforgettable movie.
