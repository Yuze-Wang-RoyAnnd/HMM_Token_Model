whilst i have loved haunted house movies such as amityville and poltergeist, this made for tv adaption of susan hills book packs a huge punch on the horrors of hollywood.<br /><br />with a brilliant cast (many of which star in heartbeat and other tv dramas), great acting, and fantastic setting (which portrays 1920's life convincingly), it has all the right ingredients to entice the viewer into what is a powerful ghost story.<br /><br />herbert wise did not need blood, violence, or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience. using your own imagination, the woman in black is a figure of fear and dread, and whose presence is never absent once she first appears.<br /><br />the main character arthur kidd, a solicitor, learns about his unseen spectre on his mission to settle the estate. the widow dies and arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many oddities, which may haunt him for some days. some of the scenes are very unsettling and claustrophobic, particularly the locked room which opens itself, which turns the generator off and closes arthur in darkness. the film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in arthurs shoes, and his efforts to shake this ghost off. the writer puts many chilling additions into the story, an example being the tin soldier's re-appearance. one is eager to learn the meaning of it all. the fact we never really learn that much about the widow, leaves more to the imagination and makes it all the more unsettling.<br /><br />the widow for the most part, looks vicious and intimidating. the scene after winding the generator sent the chills down me, a woman who appears out of nowhere on isolated marshy land with a howling wind
