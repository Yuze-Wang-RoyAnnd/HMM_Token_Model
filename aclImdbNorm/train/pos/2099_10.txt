this is superb - the acting wonderful, sets, clothes, music - but most of all the story itself.<br /><br />i am amazed there aren't more reviews of this movie - certainly one of the best of the 1980s.<br /><br />it's also a wonderful movie to see in tandem with the great "random harvest" which has much the same opening crisis <br /><br />-- a middle aged, unknown english w.w.i officer is in a hospital toward the close of the war, suffering from shell shock and complete amnesia without any idea of his name, origin, or anywhere he belongs - he proves to be a very wealthy established man - when he "recovers", he will not remember the years before the war -- <br /><br />but there the movies' resemblances end.<br /><br />my warmest thanks to all who participated in the movie - particularly the actors ian holm, alan bates, ann margret (what a great and surprising casting choice), glenda jackson, julie christie.<br /><br />this one stays with you forever.
