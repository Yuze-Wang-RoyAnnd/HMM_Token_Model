in the immediate aftermath following world war ii, sound minds in hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag-waving that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. "best years of our lives' and even 'gentleman's agreement' investigated the way americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war, but delmer daves' "pride of the marines" beat them to it.<br /><br />the film is about philadelphia smart alec john garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole, with japanese soldiers eerily crying out at him and his buddies "mariiines, tonight you die!", he is blinded by a hand-grenade, and dumps his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her after coming home.<br /><br />delmer daves is uncompromising in his depiction on these men who are brave, as it were, almost by coincidence. they are there, in the foxhole, and when shot at, they react. so much for heroism, but they get the job done. and then comes the self-pity, the dark, gloomy sense of humor. garfield is in angry denial of his blindness and the film makes no excuses, "there's no free candy for anyone in this world", as his buddy tells him. the same guy, a jew, played by dane clark, reminds him, "in a war somebody gets it, and you're it. everybody's got problems! when i get back, some guys won't hire me, because my name is diamond".<br /><br />great movies are made with guts like these, and if the first half hour of 'pride of the marines' fails to rise to the occasion completely, from then on it evolves into a true work of art. you weep, and you ponder, you ache and you hope against hope. well, simply: art.<br /><br />
