i think that the movie was kind of weird. in the opening scene, a person is killed for no reason. he doesn't get mentioned again. the special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie. it isn't the best example of a classic horror movie but it still was an alright movie. i give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale.
