18 directors had the same task: tell stories of love set in paris. naturally, some of them turned out better than others, but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - besides, wouldn't it be boring if all of them had the same vision of love? here's how i rank the segments (that might change on a second viewing):<br /><br />1. "quartier latin", by g'erard depardieu<br /><br />one of the greatest french actors ever directed my favourite segment, featuring the always stunning gena rowlands and ben gazzara. witty and delightful.<br /><br />2. "tour eiffel", by sylvain chomet<br /><br />cute, visually stunning (thanks to the director of "the triplets of belleville") story of a little boy whose parents are mimes;<br /><br />3. "tuileries", by ethan and joel coen<br /><br />the coen brothers + steve buscemi = hilarious<br /><br />4. "parc monceau", by alfonso cuar'on ("y tu mam'a tambi'en", "children of men"), feat. nick nolte and ludivine sagnier (funny);<br /><br />5. "place des f^etes", by oliver schmitz, feat. seydou boro and aissa maiga (touching);<br /><br />6. "14th arrondissement", alexander payne's ("election", "about schmidt") wonderful look for the pathetic side of life is present here, feat. the underrated character actress margo martindale (hilary swank's mother in "million dollar baby") as a lonely, middle-aged american woman on vacation;<br /><br />7. "faubourg saint-denis", tom tykwer's ("run lola run") frantic style works in the story of a young actress (natalie portman) and a blind guy (melchior beslon) who fall in love;<br /><br />8. "p`ere-lachaise", by wes craven, feat. emily mortimer and rufus sewell (plus a curious cameo by alexander payne as...oscar wilde!);<br /><br />9. "loin du 16`eme", by walter salles and daniela thomas (simple but moving story from the talented brazilian directors, feat. catalina sandino moreno);<br /><br />10. "quartier des enfants rouges", by olivier assayas ("clean"), a sad story feat. the always fantastic maggie gyllenhaal;<br /><br />11. "le marais", by gus van sant, feat. gaspard ulliel, elias mcconnell and marianne faithful (simple, but funny);<br /><br />12. "quartier de la madeleine", by vincenzo natali, feat. elijah wood and olga kurylenko;<br /><br />13. "quais de seine", by gurinder chadha;<br /><br />14. "place des victoires", by nobuhiro suwa, feat. juliette binoche and willem dafoe;<br /><br />15. "bastille", by isabel coixet (fabulous director of the underrated "my life without me"), feat. miranda richardson, sergio castellitto, javier c'amara and leonor watling;<br /><br />16. "pigalle", by richard lagravenese, feat. bob hoskins and fanny ardant;<br /><br />17. "montmartre", by and with bruno podalyd`es;<br /><br />18. "porte de choisy", by christopher doyle, with barbet schroeder (mostly known as the director of "barfly", "reversal of fortune" and "single white female").<br /><br />i could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average (or even slightly boring), but not a single of them is plain bad. on the whole, i give "paris, je t'aime" an 8.5/10 and recommend it for what it is: a lovely mosaic about love and other things in between.
