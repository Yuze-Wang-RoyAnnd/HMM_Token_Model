the matador (2005) *** _ pierce brosnan, greg kinnear, hope davis, philip baker hall, dylan baker. brosnan gives one of his best non-bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin facing a mid-life crisis while on assignment in mexico where he befriends a square yet likable american businessman (kinnear at his most affable) and discovers there is more to life than death. newbie filmmaker richard shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath-of-fresh-air into the 'buddy comedy' formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing brosnan to get his ya-yas out with devilish glee. a sleeper gem indie hit.
