in cold blood has to be ranked as first-rate movie-making, even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make-believe, but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work, based as it is on a true-life crime spree.<br /><br />it opens with quincy jones' music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward kansas city, effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end. the b&w photography of conrad hall does a superb job right from the start.<br /><br />also clear from the start: robert blake and scott wilson are natural born actors. they do a great job of portraying free spirited buddies looking for the next thrill. "ever see a millionaire fry in the electric hair? hell no. there are two kinds of rules in this world. one for the rich and one for the poor," says wilson, taking a swig of alcohol behind the wheel.<br /><br />both are destined to cross the path of a farm family, showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind.<br /><br />blake, reminiscing about movies, and thinking of hunting for gold in mexico, says: "remember bogart in 'treasure of the sierra madre'?" (an ironic moment, because blake himself was in the film as a little boy selling lottery tickets). "i got you pegged for a natural born killer," wilson tells blake.<br /><br />john forsythe is one of the lead detectives on the case, discovering that all four family members were tied up, shot in the head and one had his throat cut. "don't people around here lock doors?" asks paul stewart. "they will tonight," is the terse reply.<br /><br />after the murders, the killers discover that there was "no big fat safe in the wall", like their prison informant told them. so, in the end, it was truly a stupid, senseless crime. the question is: why did they do it? and this is something the second half of the film explores in depth. it takes an hour and a half into the movie before the detectives catch up with the killers and begin the interrogation.<br /><br />it's these final scenes that carry the most conviction and the most interest as the boys are told they've made numerous mistakes and left a living witness. the actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end. "it makes no sense," blake tells forsythe. "mr. cutter was a very nice gentleman. i thought so right up until the time i cut his throat." the screenplay by richard brooks is concise and to the point--and so is his direction.<br /><br />summing up: brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on a crime spree that made no sense then or now for a mere $43. chilling.
