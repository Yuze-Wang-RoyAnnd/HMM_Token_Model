what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that, while perhaps lacking in substance, still provides great entertainment throughout it's running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do. i saw this film principally because it was directed by john dahl - a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction, rounders and roadkill. i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i've already seen from the director, it would be well worth watching - and red rock west is certainly a film that dahl can be proud of. the plot focuses on the overly moral michael; a man travelling across america looking for work. he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county - only catch is that the job is to murder a man's wife. he's been mistaken for a killer named lyle, but instead of doing the job; he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway. however, his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real lyle turns up...<br /><br />john dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road; he did it three years earlier with kill me again, and again almost a decade on from this film with roadkill. it's not hard to see why dahl chooses this sort of location, as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one. dahl also provides his film with a 'film noir' like atmosphere, as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters. the acting is largely very good, with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role, and getting a-class support from lara flynn boyle, j.t. walsh and, of course, dennis hopper; who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance. it has to be said that the second half of the film isn't as gripping as the first, but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it. overall, red rock west is a film that you're unlikely to regret watching. it's thrilling throughout, and you can't ask for much more than that!
