"panic in the streets" is a fairly unknown little movie from director elia kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as "a streetcar named desire", "on the waterfront" and "east of eden". kazan already won an oscar in 1947, before this movie, so he was not a completely unknown at the time. still "panic in the streets" is mostly a movie that passed under the radar.<br /><br />the great thing about this movie is the oscar winning script. it has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime/film-noir elements. the dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility.<br /><br />the cast is fairly unknown (especially at the time it was released) but it still features zero mostel and jack palance in one of their first movie roles. especially palance impresses as the tough gangster boss, with a very powerful looking face.<br /><br />still the movie drags a little at some points. the movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from.<br /><br />yet, "panic in the streets" remains a perfectly watchable movie, mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch. for fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.<br /><br />8/10
