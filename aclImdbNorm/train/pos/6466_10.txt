i really loved this movie and so did the audience that i saw it with in los angeles. after the film, lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them. i can see why it was such a huge hit in its homeland, sweden. the film is masterfully directed and each character brilliantly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and care about them. the music is very natural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking but inspiring. would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see - even people who don't normally go to subtitled films. definitely deserved the oscar nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected without pretension in a small-town community with everyday people. it is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. a must see!
