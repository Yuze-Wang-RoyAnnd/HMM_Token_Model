i first saw enchanted april about five years ago. i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas. it's about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april, leaving their humdrum lives behind them. they are very sad women at the outset of the film, and you can't help but root them on as they plan this get-away with two other women they invite along to share the expenses. this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen. it' pure and simple, with no car chases, no animosities and no deaths. it was made with care and in very good taste. you cannot help but smile all through it -- except when you're crying happy tears!
