i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne's "waitress" (2007). this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie. adrienne was a marvelously talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency. ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge. male lead reg rodgers, looking like judd nelson, is fine. there is also a great cameo by ben vereen. the song at the end of the movie "the bastard song" written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy: <br /><br />"it's a world of suffering,<br /><br />in a sea of pain,<br /><br />no matter how much sun you bring,<br /><br />you're pummeled by the rain...<br /><br />don't let the heartless get you down,<br /><br />don't greet the heartless at your door,<br /><br />don't live among the heartless"
