here is one the entire family will enjoy... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. shelley duvall outdid herself with this unique, imaginative take on nearly all of the popular fairy tales of childhood. the scripts offer new twists on the age-old fables we grew up on and they feature a handful of stars in each episode. "cinderella" is no exception to duvall's standard and in my opinion it's one of the top five of the series, highlighted by jennifer beals (remember her from "flashdance"--and she's still in hollywood today making a movie here and there) in the title role, jean stapleton as the fairy godmother with a southern accent and eve arden as the embodiment of wicked stepmotherhood. edie mcclurg ("ferris bueller's day off") and jane alden make for a hilarious duo as the stepsisters. matthew broderick is an affable prince henry. you'll all keep coming back for this one!
