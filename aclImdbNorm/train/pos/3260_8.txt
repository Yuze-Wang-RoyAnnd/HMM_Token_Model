people call this a comedy, but when i just watched it, i laughed<br /><br />only once. i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was 14,<br /><br />and i wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be<br /><br />taken seriously. there were quite a few scenes that were meant<br /><br />to be funny, but i cared too much about the characters to laugh at<br /><br />them.<br /><br />i suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love,<br /><br />and try to take it seriously. i think you'll find that, despite a few silly<br /><br />flaws, it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.
