*** out of ****<br /><br />yep! dressed to kill is that kind of a movie. it's like kalifornia, but it's different. remember? that movie from 1993 which stars brad pitt as a serial killer who is "welcomed" by a couple of travelers in a trip to california as a buddy who might be a good company along the way. when i watch a movie, i always like not to know anything at all about the plot, before watching it, because the surprises may get even cooler. that's how it was with kalifornia. when i watched it last year for the first time, i never realized it was a suspense movie, so when i found out, i was shocked, and when the movie went on and on, it got even better and i was at the edge of my seat, almost kissing my monitor, so close i was to it! so, we're discussing about dressed to kill, right? before i watched this movie (today!), i've only watched 2 others movies from brian de palma, so i can say i don't really know that well his works, but can tell from afar that these 2 movies for me were as great as they could be. carrie (1976) and mission:impossible (1996). when i watched carrie on the tv, i was really that desperate to get a dvd copy and i can tell: this movie is great! mission:impossible also. and today, i watched a third movie from depalma. <br /><br />well, dressed to kill is a movie like kalifornia. when the movie goes on, it goes completely different than what you'd expect. i was watching, very curious, the scene of the museum, where dickinson follows the mysterious man to his cab and they end together in an apartment room. you may guess what may have happened there. but when the movie reached the scene of the elevator, the movie went completely on a different path. i was watching the rest of the movie, and i really liked it. however, there are some low points... some characters in the movie are completely silent! take, for example, the mysterious man from the museum scene. i was always hoping that he could say something but he never did! this was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece. even in the cab scene, where dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum, the completely silent man grabs her, pulls her inside the cab, and they start kissing each other. you know, it reminded me of the mexican tv series of the 70's "el chavo del 8", where some characters are completely silent. getting past these low points of the movie, it is actually a great movie, considering the suspense, the characters and the plot. dennis franz is cool as detective marino! reminded me of him as capt. carmine lorenzo in die hard 2 (1990) where he plays almost the same kind of character. <br /><br />well, concluding this review, the ending of dressed to kill is the same ending as it is in carrie! i don't know if i really liked that, because i hate imitations! i understand that carrie is a movie from depalma, so it's not actually an imitation, because after all it was his idea! but it turned to be a repetitive idea in dressed to kill, so depalma could have done something different instead of showing nancy allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to amy irving at the ending scene of carrie. this was, of course, with no doubt, another low point. but if you get past this, you will find that dressed to kill is a really good movie, and i assure you that it's not, by any means, a waste of time watching it.
