second-feature concerns a young woman in london desperate for a job, happy to accept live-in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son. thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy--i end up feeling like a prisoner too--but this rather classy b-film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic. it's far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (nina foch) is quick on her feet. rehashing this in 1986 (as "dead of winter") proved not to be wise, as the plot-elements are not of the modern-day. "julia ross" is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!) but it stays the course nicely until a too-rushed climax, which feels a little sloppy. *** from ****
