look, although we don't like to admit it, we've all have to suppress our fears concerning the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events that take place in this movie. you know: you get into your car and you immediately start thinking,"gosh, i hope today isn't the day that my accelerator sticks at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 mph, all four door latches break in the locked position, both my main and emergency brake fail, my ignition switch can't be turned off, and i've got a full tank of gas; all simultaneously." fortunately, for most of us, our thorazine kicks-in before we actually decide that it's a bad idea to be driving a car. not so for the makers of the harrowing, white-knuckle, edge-of-your-seat (if only in preparation to leave the room) action juggernaut, "runaway car" but they go ahead and drive anyway!<br /><br />i am endlessly pleased to have found (thanks to the imdb) that this movie is real, and that i didn't merely dream it.<br /><br />this movie is, at the very least, one of the fantastic sights you will see on your journey to find the el dorado of very bad cinema.<br /><br />i highly recommend it.
