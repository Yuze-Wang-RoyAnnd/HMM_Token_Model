hint number one - read the title as "the time of the mad dog," or perhaps dogs. this is a pretty good ensemble piece (look at the cast and rent it - you know you're curious already), and first-time director bishop gives them their chance, taking his time, letting the characters interact and chew the scenery as they wait - not enthusiastically - for the return of "the big boss" and whatever revenge ensues.<br /><br />for some of us, the highlight is seeing christopher jones after his self-imposed exile from films; he remains a commanding film presence. and yes, with christopher jones, larry bishop and richard pryor involved, this is the "wild in the streets" reunion party!
