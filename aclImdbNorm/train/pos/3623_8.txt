disney might just be on to something here. first, they had "remember the titans" with denzel, a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle america. now, with quaid and the rookie... yet another sports story based on truth.<br /><br />both movies move you to tears at times, and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them. my wife and i took in the rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie. we were not let down, when asked if we'd be buying this on dvd when it comes out, it was a no-brainer. most definately.
