wasn't sure what to expect from this film. i love watching brosnan in any movie, he's always good, but this was totally different. he's a mess, and plays being a mess very well. in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni :) so yes, there's not a lot of violence, there's not a lot of action, but the dialogue is cracking, the acting is superb and very refreshing, and it's pretty funny too :) i don't think you'll come out of the cinema going "wow! i was blown away", but you'll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film. can't ask for more than that.<br /><br />oh, and if you're lucky, some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you'll get inverted, upside down, reversed (with reversed audio) adverts!! brilliant. nothing like watching a jack daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american "twin peaks" commentary :)
