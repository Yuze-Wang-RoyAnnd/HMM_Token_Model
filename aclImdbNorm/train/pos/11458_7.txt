greetings again from the darkness. insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. how strange for most of us to see someone who must work... no matter the conditions, else his reason for living ceases. to see goldsworthy's sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic. this artist creates because he must - not for money or fame. it is his lifeforce. when you see his failures, energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon. it is not the dread of beginning again, it is that he takes his energy from his work. watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful, but nonetheless, breathtaking. he discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same. when he says he needs the earth, but it does not need him ... i beg to differ. only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best.
