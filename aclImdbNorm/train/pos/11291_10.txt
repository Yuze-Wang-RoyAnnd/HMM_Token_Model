has anyone been able to buy this movie? my uncle "hutch" was a real (not reel) pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot's wings. <br /><br />he's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie. he was killed in a dogfight over italy, he was only 24 at the time. do we know the film studio that made it?<br /><br />or has anyone seen it at a video store, like blockbuster? i wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make dvd's these days.<br /><br />please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where i can buy a copy. thank you.
