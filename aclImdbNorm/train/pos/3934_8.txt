young mr.lincoln is a poetic,beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in american history. henry fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about. it is perhaps the actors best performance.watch how he singlehandedly stops a lynching-mob.alice brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer woman.most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom,and there lies the only negative thing i can say about this movie.most of the characters from judge to spectators are given so many folksy humorously lines that distracts from the serious trial that is on hand.but i'm quite used to this because the humor is a ford trademark. supporting parts by ward bond and donald meek are very good.
