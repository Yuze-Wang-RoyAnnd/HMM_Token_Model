one of my favourite "domestic" movies. i don't know if there is any person in our country who hasn't seen this movie! it's funny, and sad at some moments...i don't know how did people around the world (who had opportunity to watch it) accept this movie, because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of serbs in the first half of the 20th century, to be able to understand it! but as i see here, there is somebody from canada who watched it...and he liked it.<br /><br />i think that i'll try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site, but first to find out how to do that...<br /><br />cheers.
