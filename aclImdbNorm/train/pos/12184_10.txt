in a lot of his films (citizen kane, confidential report, touch of evil) orson welles gave him the role of an exuberant men. in "the lady from shanghai" it's the only time i see him holding the role of the victim. the role of the culprit, he gave it to rita hayworth, i guess it's because he was in love with her. therefore, it's an interesting film. but i find the story excellent too. the direction is genius, as usual with welles : two scenes are particularly brilliant: the one in the aquarium and the final one with the mirrors. this film is brilliant.(10/10)
