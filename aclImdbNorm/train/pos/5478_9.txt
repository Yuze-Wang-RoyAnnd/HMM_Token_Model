no sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. here's a few different slants on it from one of those "religious nuts," as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly. <br /><br />1) "baby face" (1933) offers perhaps the classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. there is a lot of truth to what barbara stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want.<br /><br />in this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. at least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. <br /><br />2) the ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. a sad comment that so many "critics" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. no surprise, i guess.<br /><br />any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start-to-finish and stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. at a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it.
