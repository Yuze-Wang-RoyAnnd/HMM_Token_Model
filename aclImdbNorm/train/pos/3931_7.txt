a somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of abraham lincoln's early years from director john ford, concentrating primarily on a trial in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder.<br /><br />the film offers an interesting portrayal of this important american figure and the film is well made, but seems somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments from his presidency or even his debates with stephen douglas. the obvious intent was to portray lincoln as young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become. but the result for me was that while i admired the portrayal it just wasn't as satisfying as i think it could have been with a greater scope.<br /><br />in the role of abraham lincoln we have henry fonda who effectively displays a quiet strength. fonda's performance includes some gangly mannerisms' and other affectations which are fairly effective in presenting a portrayal of lincoln, particularly when combined with some effective makeup and the costuming which occasionally is a bit to overt.<br /><br />the supporting cast is solid and surprisingly does not include that many of ford's regular supporting cast (sometimes referred to as his stock company) but we do have ward bond one of the most prolific character actors in hollywood. bond has appeared in more of the afi top 100 films than any other actor, both the original and revised list. he has also appeared in 11 best picture nominees.<br /><br />the film features one scene that would seem to have inspired a quite similar scene in "to kill a mockingbird", where it would be done even better than it is here, even though that scene is one of the most effective in this film.
