"the classic war of the worlds" by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h. g. wells' classic book. mr. hines succeeds in doing so. i, and those who watched his film with me, appreciated the fact that it was not the standard, predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year, e.g. the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book. obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. those who envision themselves as amateur "critics" look only to criticize everything they can. others rate a movie on more important bases,like being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the "critics". we enjoyed the effort mr. hines put into being faithful to h.g. wells' classic novel, and we found it to be very entertaining. this made it easy to overlook what the "critics" perceive to be its shortcomings.
