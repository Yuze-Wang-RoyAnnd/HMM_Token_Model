in this 1943 film, judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-van heflin. this film was certainly a big change for mr. heflin, especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in "johnny eager."<br /><br />wasn't spring byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children, with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren?<br /><br />the singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between heflin and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired. it was a gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer.
