"casomai" was the last movie i've seen before getting married, just last year. <br /><br />it was also the first movie i've searched for, after i was married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest.<br /><br />sometimes, reality is not that apart from fiction. to all those who wrote that priests like "don camillo" don't exist in real life, i would recommend them to visit my priest pe. nuno westwood, in estoril, portugal :-)<br /><br />to all others, i would only recommend them to see this movie, before and after the "i do!" day :-)<br /><br />rodrigo ribeiro portugal
