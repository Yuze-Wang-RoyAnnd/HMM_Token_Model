of all the reviews i've read, most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre. neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre, he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual, as most of us are, however hard it may be for anyone to admit. alexandre is getting away with life perfectly, being totally taken care of, getting and giving what he wants. the girls are allowing this, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron. is there anything wrong with any of this? is anyone in love? really? i don't think so. though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion. ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandre's position, in an urban area can ask for. i'm looking for a patron, anyone interested?
