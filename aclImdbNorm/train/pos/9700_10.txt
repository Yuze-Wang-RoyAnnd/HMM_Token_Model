somehow, this movie manages to be invigorating, bittersweet, and heartwarming at the same time. stars like tony shalhoub (from providence) bring the tale to life. the story itself is inspiring. we see a desperate, up-and-down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird's.<br /><br />paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl (played by hallie eisenberg, also known as the pepsi girl) with a speech impediment. while she learns to speak correctly, so does paulie. however, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything being said. the military father doesn't like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist, ivy. she teaches him manners, etc., while traveling across the country to find paulie's owner. the movie continues with several twists of fate, until paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement, and found by a russian custodian, who is touched by the bird's story. the plot is in keeping with the simple, metaphorical theme that language is a gift, and a curse. i would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding. a beautiful mixture of flute, digital base, and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy. the sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more. and, as a final remark, the puppetry is entirely believable. (unlike in star wars, where yoda resembles a muppet) this film is one of my favorite movies, with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently. overall, i give this movie **** out of four stars, two thumbs up, and a big hug.
