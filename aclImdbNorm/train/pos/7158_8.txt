holes (2003, dir andrew davis) <br /><br />when stanley yelnats iv is wrongfully convicted of stealing, he is sent to 'camp green lake'. at this camp, the warden, and her two henchman, mr. sir and dr. pendanski command the campmates to dig holes after hole after hole. but for what reason? stanley plans to find out.<br /><br />i never really had any intention in watching 'holes', and i must admit, i only really watched the film, because i'm such a fan of shia labeouf, but even if you are not a fan of him, then it doesn't matter. 'holes' is one of those disney film that the whole family can enjoy. the story is lovely written and incorporates a wonderful idea of including flashbacks to the past. these are not distracting and really gives a great back story. all the cast are great. the young stars act well and the addition of jon voight and sigourney weaver are a joy. shia labeouf shows that even at 17, he can act without any flaws. this is one disney film, you definitely would enjoy as a family.<br /><br />"i learn from failure." - stanley yelnats iii (henry winkler)
