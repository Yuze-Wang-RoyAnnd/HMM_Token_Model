"i'll take you there" tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date. unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mostly tongue-in-cheek situational comedy featuring rogers and sheedy with little emphasis on romance. a sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving, stays fresh, and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers.
