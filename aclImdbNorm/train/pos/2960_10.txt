well the main reason i tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by trey parker and matt stone of south park fame. however as soon as the film started the laughs started erupting from my belly. from the subtle gestures towards a joke, to the blatant toilet humour throughout, along with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo. this film could ruin event he sternest mans poker face, let alone his poker underwear. some of the funniest blink and you'll miss it jokes ever portrayed in hollywood, along with constant critique of themselves thrown into the bargain.<br /><br />i just goes to show that not only is trey parker adept at writing he's not too shabby at the old acting game either. i was surprised with the amount that i was absorbed in this film. however i'm quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet, here in the uk. sort it out boys!<br /><br />i am, and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits, and occasionally snorting into my lager. all in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. however if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude things steer well clear! however i'm sure the inclusion of jenny mccarthy and jasmine bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudices.
