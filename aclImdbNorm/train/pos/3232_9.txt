went to see this finnish film and i've got to say that it is one of the better films i've seen this year. the intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories, all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town. the stories come together very nicely in the end, reminding, perhaps, a bit of the way tarantino's movies are made. most of the actors performed very well, which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type. i especially enjoyed the acting by sanna hietala, the lead actress, and juha kukkonen. i noticed btw that imdb has got the wrong information about sanna. her name, as you might have noticed in my review ;), is not heikkil"a, but hietala.
