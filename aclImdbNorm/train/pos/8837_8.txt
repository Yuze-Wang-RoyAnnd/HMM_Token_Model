my personal feeling is that you cannot divorce this movie from its political/historical underpinnings like so many (american) reviewers tend to do. this is not about growing up on main street, usa. it is about growing up in yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the east and the west. just like the guys are torn between esther and everybody else, and esther is torn between the "tovarish joe" and the guys. there is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under tito. i feel the movie is under-rated and it is too bad we have lost the director. movies like this make freedom feel more important. it is not just "another eastern european coming of age film"...it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom.
