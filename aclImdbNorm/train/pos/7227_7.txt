peter o'toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor. the lovely susannah york provides a good foil for o'toole's dramatic presence.<br /><br />the film alludes to incest--without a single explicit scene--but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary. though this is not major film by any reckoning, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances. <br /><br />even york, signing the papers at the end, is a treat to watch, exuding tragedy silently. the possible weakness here is thompson's laid-back direction. but the film floats because of the actors and the script.<br /><br />i saw the film twice over a period of 20 years--on both occasions with the name "brotherly love". "country dance" is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.
