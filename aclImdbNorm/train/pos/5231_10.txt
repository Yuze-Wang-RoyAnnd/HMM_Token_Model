to communicate in film essential things of life - like what is life, does it have a meaning? - is sheer impossible. of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film (story), but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness. this happens if the input from the senses overrules the "input" from our mind, i.e. our thoughts. few directors know how to communicate essential things. tarkovsky, is one. his "stalker" shows images of existence, communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind. i think de zee and de graaff do the same.
