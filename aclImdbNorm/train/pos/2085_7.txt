sidney franklin's "the good earth" has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting, especially from luis ranier, who won an oscar for her portrayal of o-lan. rainers performance is so complete, she is nearly unrecognizable. having very little dialogue throughout the entire film (and it is a long one), rainer relies instead on facial and body language. she looks and acts chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as such.<br /><br />the film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it. when lung and wife o-lan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning. it is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch) that they again find fulfillment. a common formula told with the unique perspective of a chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the film a classic. money isn't worth anything without friends and family, a point that the film drives home perfectly in it's last 10 minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion.
