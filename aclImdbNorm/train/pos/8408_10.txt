"it wasn't me! it was, er, my twin brother rupert!" bobby says to dugan when confronted about being over at sally's place. i have used this line dozens of times over the years (no one has yet to believe it, though).<br /><br />this movie is one of the all-time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability. steven oliver was perfect for the part of dugan, so much so that he was in 1978's "malibu beach" as the same character (not nearly as much screen time, though).<br /><br />"nobody calls dugan a turd!" is another line for the ages. this classic film was definitely worth the price of admission.
