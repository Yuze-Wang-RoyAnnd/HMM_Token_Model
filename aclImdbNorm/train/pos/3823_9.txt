i saw this film in the worst possible circumstance. i'd already missed 15 minutes when i woke up to it on an international flight between sydney and seoul. i didn't know what i was watching, i thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but quickly became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman who's child had been kidnapped. the premise started taking twist and turns i didn't see coming and by the end credits i was scrambling through the the in-flight guide to figure out what i had just watched. turns out i was belatedly discovering do-yeon jeon who'd won best actress at cannes for the role. i don't know if secret sunshine is typical of korean cinema but i'm off to the dvd store to discover more.
