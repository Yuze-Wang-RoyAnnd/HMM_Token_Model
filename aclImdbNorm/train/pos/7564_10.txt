in my line of work, i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film. when i can, i take a look at these low-budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs. once in a while, though, there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire, as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible. the short film b r o k e n, directed by alex ferrari, is a genuine surprise and worth a second look.<br /><br />clocking in at a scant 20 minutes, b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling (but surreal) story with almost no back story. the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening. a young woman (samantha jane polay) awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home. when she awakes, she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book. these nasty guys and girls are larger than life. they are all guns and knives. there is no way out.<br /><br />the kicker here is that, despite being a low budget film it doesn't play like one. from the very beginning, the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot, edited, and produced by professionals. it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers. the film is sharp and cool, it looks good and it feels like something big.<br /><br />the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films. polay and paul gordon (who plays the head killer, duncan) were well chosen. as two of the few speaking roles in the film, it is up to them to carry the film. no special effects, no matter how good, would have saved this film from bad acting. thankfully, polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho. some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent, but it hardly shows.<br /><br />the downside to b r o k e n is that it's only 20 minutes long. the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle. watching it, i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany, but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be. the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop, but it comes off as unsatisfying. i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film.<br /><br />my rating: 8 out of 10.
