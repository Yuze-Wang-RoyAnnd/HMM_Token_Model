this movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are amilee and my life as a dog. the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson. <br /><br />in japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life, sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. in the instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her. but is it only by her beauty, by her faraway glance, or a connection that they will both discover that they share? <br /><br />shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society, they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.
