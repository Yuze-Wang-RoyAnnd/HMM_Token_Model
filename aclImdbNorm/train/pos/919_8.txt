having been a fan of 'columbo', i was sorely disappointed in 'corky romano'. while certainly a funny movie, falk's mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he's played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used. after 'corky romano', i was honestly both surprised by and soured on mr. peter falk. however, having just seen 'finding john christmas' and its predecessor, 'a town without christmas', for the first time within a week of each other, i have to say that 'max', peter's falk's delightful character in both movies, is surely as memorable and lovable as 'columbo'. while parts of the movie are quite predictable, such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out. i too wish i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies, and i highly recommend them whether you're a falk fan, a christmas nut, or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel-good movie of the week. this movie may end up lost among the throngs of made-for-tv holiday flicks, so be sure to find 'finding john christmas' before it's too late.
