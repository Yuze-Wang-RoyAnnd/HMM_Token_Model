when i rented domino i was expected it to be very dumb. i hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and domino also just got very bad reviews. the only reason i watched it is because i like have liked keira knightley, mickey rourke, christopher walken, and tony scott on other occasions. i also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories. yes the editing and cinematography were frantic, the story was weak, and the acting was mediocre, but i still loved this film for some bizarre reason. domino was very, very entertaining and often very funny. it was horribly underrated when it was released i think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like scotts last film man on fire and instead just got wonderful entertainment. i actually understand why everybody hated domino so much, even though i loved it and recommend it.
