across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal elders. in every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'end time.' in this movie called " the last wave " an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. when those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. david burton (richard chamberlain) plays the defense attorney assigned to defend the accused. although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic aboriginal named chris lee (david gulpilil), burton proceeds to defend the infraction as tribal law and therefore not subject to standard justice. the movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. good silent drama. ****
