it has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism. the only two movies i can think of is "enchanted april" (1992) and "the enchanted cottage" (1945). both movies used wonderful actors not stars. in both movies, all the actors gave their best romantic performances.<br /><br />"enchanted april" is about four english women after wwi who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in italy while on vacation. it is amazing "enchanted april" was made in 1992. it stands out as an enjoyable classic.
