impactful film of four city slickers in crisis in appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity. each of four businessmen face their darkest fears when they tackle a challenging whitewater trip, on a river about to be replaced by a dam. when locals along the way decide to "have their way" with the interlopers it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors. each of the travelers is outstanding, although voight gives the lead and strongest performance. the rural scenery and culture is well-captured, including the breathtaking dueling banjos sequence. i saw this on a date when it came out, not exactly the perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it). i sort of remember this as a break-out dramatic performance for burt, voight was already established. not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed.
