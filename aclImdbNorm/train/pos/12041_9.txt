this is a plain old spooky ghost story. i showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club, and they were kept spellbound until the ending! no blood or gore- just good old fashioned suspense. it starts out right from the beginning, and builds and builds. the ending is a real twist that caught me unawares. <br /><br />well directed and well acted. it is also a "period piece"- set in the 1920s- which added to the atmosphere. <br /><br />i was so impressed i got the book by susan hill from amazon. the movie follows the book rather closely. <br /><br />it's a shame it's not readily available on dvd. my copy is vhs. this along with "haunted" are probably two of the best ghost stories i've ever scene. which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes "in your face" gore any day!
