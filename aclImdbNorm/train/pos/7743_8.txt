i went to see it 2 times this movie, a friend of mine went to see it at the release party, and he was telling me it was so great, that i was expecting very much about the movie, to mutch, i couldn't enjoy it because i was not watching it in nuteral position. the second time i knew what to expect and i enjoyed it more than the first time. after the second time i felt so in the mood to have a party. i loved the music it's just great.<br /><br />if tom barman improves his directing talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking about. if you can delivere this movie as your first you must be talented.<br /><br />the acting is done by some great belgian stars (dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of upcomming talents like titus de voogdt.<br /><br />
