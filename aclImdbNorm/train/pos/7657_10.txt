this is a very grim, hard hitting, even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry. it's black and white photography keeps it from being dated. mickey rooney is excellent as the twisted, yet strangely sympathetic lead. one of the first movies to portray the psychological desolation of death row. it is also quite poignant.
