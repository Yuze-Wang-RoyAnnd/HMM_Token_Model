thanks to a smart script and a steady hand from writer/director kevin meyer, "perfect alibi" is an entertaining and very likable mystery thriller. the movie starts methodically and builds up steam as the clues begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems to be. teri garr and hector elizondo are terrific as they team up to unravel the mystery, reminding me of nick and nora charles, from the "thin man" movies. kathleen quinlan is excellent as alex mcarthur's tormented wife and the character roles, played by veteran actors charles martin smith, bruce mcgill, anne ramsey and estelle harris are well done and provide plenty of light moments at just the right time. there's even a cameo by rex linn. in all, i felt like i was reading a good book by the fire.
