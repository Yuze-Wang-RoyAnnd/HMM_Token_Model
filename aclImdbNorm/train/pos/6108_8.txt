i enjoyed this film very much. many korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school. cinematography was average. the movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular. editing, however, was very neat and unusual.<br /><br />the acting was also very good. kim ha neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in the korean soap-opaeras. but this time, she plays a cute tomboy very well. kwon sang woo also plays his role very believable.<br /><br />what i like the most about this film is, the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated. there are many korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and i always thought it was very stale. there was no such crap in this movie.<br /><br />very funny and well-done.
