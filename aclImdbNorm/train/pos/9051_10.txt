i was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare. my comment? "i am watching my life!"<br /><br />though younger, but only by 5 years or so, than the "rocket boys" i remember the absolute urgency with which sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole science fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind. my own tornado landed me in my own state's science fair, in physics by '62, though our group was less successful in gaining the support of, for example, firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event, our city went so far as to allow us to tour the nike missile site on chicago's lakeshore.<br /><br />this movie brought it all back for me and i will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us "ubernerds" of the late '50s and early 60's.<br /><br />we are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country. see it!
