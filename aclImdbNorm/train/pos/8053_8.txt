this is of of sammo's great early comedy films. this isn't a parody of enter the dragon, the main character (sammo) is obsessed with bruce lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size. nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting. oh, the fighting. good, fast-paced scenes with high impact (the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of sammo's kicks).<br /><br />the funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional. there is a jim kelly looking guy (one of three experts hired to take out sammo), but he was a chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig. come on, didn't they have any real black people in hong kong in 1978? well, i guess i've seen enough white fake-as-hell "chinese people" in old american movies too.<br /><br />this is one is for any sammo or bruce lee fan.
