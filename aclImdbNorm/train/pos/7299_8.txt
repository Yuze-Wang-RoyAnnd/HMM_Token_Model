poorly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster... awesome. the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. haha. good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners. i highly enjoyed this movie, but before you watch it make sure you're in for a good laugh. i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious. i can not, in my right mind, think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. however, if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy, i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed. very simply. so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. it brought some joy into my life.
