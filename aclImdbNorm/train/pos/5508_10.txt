the year is 1964. ernesto "che" guevara, having been a cuban citizen for the last five years,disappears from the face of the earth,leaving a glum fidel castro to announce that he is probably dead,when in truth, he has left cuba to move to bolivia to live an assumed identity. whilst living in la paz,guevara undertakes an idea to overthrow the corrupt,bourgeois government there. once again,steven soderberg takes up where 'che:part one' leaves off (only better this time). the pacing is more on target,the job of acting is ever so fine (including a turn by a sickly looking benecio del toro,as che guevara). suffice it to say,it's probably best if you see both films,to get the true story of guevara & what kind of a man he was (i had the rare open window of opportunity to see both films at one screening----talk about a long haul!). as with 'che-part 1:the argentine',this film has no mpaa rating, but contains enough salty language & violence to easily snag it an 'r'.
