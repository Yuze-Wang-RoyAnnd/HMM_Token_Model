it is often only after years pass that we can look back and see those stars who are truly stars. as that french film critic, whose name escapes me, said: "there is no garbo. there is no dietrich. there is only louise brooks"; and there is, thank heavens! louise brooks! this is the third of her european masterpieces. but it is also an exceptional film for being one, if not the, first french talkie, for following a script written by famed ren'e clair, for reportedly being finished (the direction, that is) by georg pabst, and for incorporating the voice of edith piaf before she was well known! so much talent working on and in a film, how couldn't it turn out to be a masterpiece?! and that's what this film is. it's a shame louise brooks was blackballed by hollywood when she came back to the states--so much talent cast so arrogantly by the wayside! in the film, in addition to getting to watch louise brooks in action, it's great to see pictures of paris ca. 1930 and to hear piaf's young voice. i never get tired of this film!
