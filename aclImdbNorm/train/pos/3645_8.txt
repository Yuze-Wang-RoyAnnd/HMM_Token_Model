a fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at doing something about them when the chance strikes. nothing was easy for morris either-he had a family, job, job opps elsewheres, a mortgage, etc-it wasn't like he could just drop what he was doing and blithely hop on the greyhound to play aaa ball for 4 months. it took guts. i am glad that they showed his indecision, almost up 'til he got the callup to the majors.<br /><br />i can remember seeing him pitch against the red sox(i think...), it was a great story. though morris actually looks more like john kruk or a mills watson than quaid-that's okay. <br /><br />quaid does a very good job playing the man, the teacher, coach and 'oldest rookie'.... as someone who is in the the same age group, i certainly can id with his plight. you're not quite too old to do what you had dreamed of as a kid, but it's getting there. you have to do it sooner than lator.<br /><br />believably told, nicely edited, paced, acted, good to see the familiar faces of the late royce applegate, brian cox and rachel griffiths here.<br /><br />good job all around, glad to see it hit.<br /><br />*** outta ****...who woulda thought that the tampa devil rays woulda been the subject of such a good movie early on?
