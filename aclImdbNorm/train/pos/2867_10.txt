i lost my father at a very young age.so young in fact,that i have no recollection of him.over the years i have learned many things about him. one of those things was that he loved westerns,and watching bonanza every sunday evening was an absolute ritual for him.i,myself, remember the tail end of the series' run,having been 8 years old when the show ceased production in 1973.watching this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my long ago lost father.it has all the right elements to make a show successful;laughter,tears,edge of your seat suspense,and it even angered you at times.my most vivid memory of the show's original run,came shortly after the death of our beloved "hoss" cartwright,dan blocker.one particular episode,and the end of the closing credits, flashed a picture of blocker,and faded to black,and i can also recall my oldest sister with a tear in her eye at the sight of this.i can remember this as though it were yesterday.on behalf of my late father, who is not here to say so himself,we love bonanza.long live the cartwrights.
