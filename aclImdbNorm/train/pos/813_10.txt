after ''empire strikes back'' ''return of the jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the star wars series.<br /><br />luke went to tattoine to save han solo from jabba. at the same time, the galactic empire is doing in secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous death star. if this station stays totally constructed, it will be the end of the rebel alliance. both vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new death star,and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule.<br /><br />r2 and c3po are inside jabba's palace to send a message from luke to jabba,where lukes pretends to negotiate han's life. he gives r2 and c3po as a gift to jabba as part of his plan. jabba does not accept the negotiation,since he is using han solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(han still is frozen in carbonite) lando is hidden as jabba's guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter. when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise. the problem is that jabba discovers leia's plan and takes her as his slave,while han is thrown away in chewbacca's cell.<br /><br />luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends. at his first try to kill jabba,he falls into jabba's monster cell (bantha),but easily kills it. jabba stays angry and decides to thrown han,chewbacca and luke to sarlacc, a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it's 'food'. luke,han and chewie has success in scape again, and even boba fett dies when han accidentally throws him in to sarlacc's mouth. leia kills jabba and goes after han,luke and chewie as well c3po and r2. <br /><br />everybody's safe again,luke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedi,as well his promise to yoda. the problem is that yoda is too old and sick, since he already has 900 years old, and before he dies, yoda says to luke that he does not need more training,but to really be a jedi, he must fight with vader again. he confirms to luke that vader is luke's dad, and that there is another skywalker besides luke. in his last moments, yoda asks to luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to luke transmit his jedi knowledge to other people. when yoda dies,obi wan's spirit shows up to luke and tells him that luke's father killed his good side anakin to become darth vader, and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. luke stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. obi wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia, and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies. he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader, the emperor will win the war.<br /><br />at the same time, the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up, since luke is stronger than before, and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark side.<br /><br />now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series,when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station, the '' death star 2'', luke will confront vader and the emperor, and leia, han and chewie needs to turn off the 'death star 2' power field, with the help of the ewoks.
