i have seen this movie more than several times, on tv. i always watch it again...never turning the channel. this movie is full of chilling surprises, and absolutely edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, without being overbearing or stupid. helen hunt's talent is magnificently shown in this movie! i recommend this movie to anyone!!!
