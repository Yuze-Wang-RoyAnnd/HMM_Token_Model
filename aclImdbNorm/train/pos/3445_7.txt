first, this was a brave film. i've seen irreversible and can understand the comparisons. however, i cannot begin to understand the people who've trashed this film. i can see how the end may have come off extreme but i'd be lying if i didn't say i wished that every guy who's ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what jared got. conversely, it didn't solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesn't pretend to is what made me appreciate it.<br /><br />the comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with. i certainly did and intently. i'm 24 years old. the way the film drags made it realistic to me. people have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film, not only do they lose interest, they demolish whatever has been built, and call it rubbish. when in actuality it's their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as talia lugacy's.<br /><br />rosario dawson displayed the numbness of self-destruction flawlessly. i think she portrayed maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act i rarely ever see done well. often times, much like the films "aimed at teens" mentioned in the prior comment, the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and lifeless. dawson, in my opinion, manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to: drone-like existence in the waking hours, working some dead end job to survive (and distract) and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings.<br /><br />i thought this film told the truth and i appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape. so many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning...i believe that maya's face during the act was the end...not the act itself...not the vengeance or the meaning behind it...just her face...<br /><br />thank you
