i saw this movie at the theaters when i was about 6 or 7 years old. i loved it then, and have recently come to own a vhs version. <br /><br />my 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it. <br /><br />i have enjoyed watching it again too. though i have to admit it is not as good on a little tv.<br /><br />i do not have older children so i do not know what they would think of it. <br /><br />the songs are very cute. my daughter keeps singing them over and over.<br /><br />hope this helps.
