the true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. some would say this is the tragic tale of america in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and aids. honestly, this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. what is the second part of their master plan? once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get high again. great plan. even if you don't know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises. the fact that cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. the story was better off with a more straight forward approach. as it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. the bigger story, in more ways than one, is john holmes. he is the center of this story anyway. this movie should have been all about him, his life. he was the one in wonderland, with the wonders about to fade away.<br /><br />p.s. although it isn't official, boogie nights is a better version of holmes life. it isn't entirely factual, but it's far more enjoyable.
