what's the best way to start a review of a movie like der todesking? let me start by saying i've just come direct from viewing this movie, and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and i don't think they'll be moving any time soon.<br /><br />it's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you haven't seen it. if not, let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate-budget gem that's been lost for a few years a la "near dark", nor is it a low budget, schlocky, "fun" b-movie. what it is it low-budget art, put forward in a simple yet poignant way. the idea is a simple one - seven stories revolving around, and ending in, suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse. sounds simple right, even boring? it isn't. words can't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through; it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not.<br /><br />i could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction; maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super-8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky. i could point out that some of the sound effects are out-of-sync in a way to rival any fulci movie, but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance.<br /><br />as far as extreme movies go, i've seen the hardest of them, and yet der todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed, despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that i would consider "gratuitous". in fact, the most disturbing scene i found was the last tale. i won't ruin it, just to say that the character's emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise, if not yearn for his end. <br /><br />sure, it's not the best movie ever made, and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish, but in spite of these flaws der todesking is an experience i would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema. if you're someone who likes comfortable viewing or "nice" movies, or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless, this is not what you're looking for. <br /><br />whether you enjoy it or not, it's one you won't forget in a hurry.
