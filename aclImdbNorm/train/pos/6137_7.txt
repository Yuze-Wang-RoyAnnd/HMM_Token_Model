what a great gem this is. it's an unusual story that is fun to watch. yes, it has singing, but it is very nicely crafted into the story and is very melodic to hear. it was so pleasant to watch; i enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /><br />the movie takes place in england during world war ii. it is about an apprentice witch who is searching for a missing portion of a spell that she needs. she uses her rough "magic" to transport her and 3 children under her care to various destinations to find it. they are joined by her correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work! <br /><br />although the special effects may seem a little dated at first, once you get used to them they become part of the charm of this movie. in fact, the movie won an oscar for these effects! <br /><br />the movie is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like the tuneful songs. the characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. i think anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie.
