let me set the scene. it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies. i am with my friend deciding what to see. we look for a movie that is starting soon and "the grinch" comes up. we buy tickets not knowing what to expect. what we got was a roller coaster of fun.<br /><br />jim carrey (who may i add is my no.1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron howard's best movie (next to apollo 13). the way that this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music was just amazing. it really brought this childhood movie to life.<br /><br />the story is based upon the story of the grinch. as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas. he lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk. but one little girl is going to change the grinch's look on life and on others in a drastic way.<br /><br />cindy lou who (played by adorable new actress taylor momsem) meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away. she attempts to break the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the towns people.<br /><br />all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents. a solid 10/10. well done jim.<br /><br />
