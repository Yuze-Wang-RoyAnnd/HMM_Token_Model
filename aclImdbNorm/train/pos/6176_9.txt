the 1986 tv movie of the spirit was a pilot for a possible series. however, spirit creator will eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced. i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit (sorry) of the comic with a modern twist. i'm sorry it didn't materialize into a series. sam (flash gordon) jones was a perfect spirit. nana visitor was a nice ellen dolan and of course would later go on to star trek:deep space nine years later. maybe with the release of frank miller's big-screen version of the spirit, more people will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history. it seems that when hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea, someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars. when antonio banderas donned the mask of zorro, we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on dvd, such as the great alain delon version of the 1970s (although all copies i ever saw were badly edited). heres hoping someone will release the tv adventure of the spirit to dvd soon.
