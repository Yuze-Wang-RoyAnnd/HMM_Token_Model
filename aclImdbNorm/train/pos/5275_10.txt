this movie is great! this movie is beautiful! finally, a movie that portrays moslems as people, no stereotypes here. this movie is driven by the story, by the acting and above all by its theme, that of cultural affirmation and discovery. they may seem like clich'es but they are not, at least not in this movie. the vista of the grand mosque of mecca is absolutely stupendous and the audience is given a glimpse of a side of the moslem world that is rarely of ever shown in the west. here the people are caring, supportive, devout, tolerant and devoted to each other. what a welcomed and way overdue departure from the usual negative portrayals of arabs. outstanding movie.
