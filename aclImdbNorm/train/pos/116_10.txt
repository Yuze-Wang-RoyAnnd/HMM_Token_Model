man oh man... i've been foolishly procrastinating (not the right term, there's a long list!) to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so. and "news" are: marvellous labyrinthine spectacle!<br /><br />for any von trier's "follower": both rigets, element of crime, dogville, dancer in the dark, the five obstructions, etc... europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms. everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic! you really get the feeling of being inside this "imaginary" nightmarish time warp. taking from the masters of surreal cinema like bunuel, bergman, till noir films of the 40's with acidic drops of avant-guard von trier leads the art-film scene as the "well intended totalitarian" movie maker of nowadays. his authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues, without being irrational, hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world.<br /><br />as utopian as it seems, i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect. the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary, as a tool for reflection, perhaps it could be the start of a new era: "the age of emotional control over our fears". this is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over.<br /><br />bravo!
