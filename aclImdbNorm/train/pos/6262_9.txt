this was incredible, meaning that it was hard to believe, that the "forgotten tribe" would make this astounding migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, cooper and schoedsack, didn't stage some of the scenes and shots. but what shots they are! the cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the score of iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richness.<br /><br />i had the pleasure of seeing this and "kon tiki" on the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science.
