i think this is a great version, i came on here before, to help me find which version i should use and i went to jane eyre 1983 and read a comment from users comment and then helped me to get this version. i do not regret picking this version and neither will you. i tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to it,there is nothing like the book,and trust me if you are reading the book you want something that is going to match up with it. when you are looking for something real and moving after you have read the book it is hard because you want something that is going to match up with that. i would say god personally led me to this version. it points to true love for a humans. i would say god's love is greater.if there is anything better, i would like to see it. but so far there is none like it!
