i had heard this movie was good from a lot of my friends that saw it, and they all said it was amazing, so i had very high expectations- and nancy drew exceeded those high expectations! it had funny parts, it kept me entertained with the action and all the dudes trying to kill her, and emma roberts was amazing as nancy drew. the rest of the cast was very good, also. i would definitely recommend this movie!! <br /><br />nancy: "i wonder why those guys were trying to kill us?!" corky: "yeah, i was wondering that too. actually, it's kinda creeping me out!"<br /><br />nancy: "i hate when people try to kill me. it's so rude!"<br /><br />~nancy drew
