this episode from the first season slightly edges towards controversy with the whole gender bending angle.i imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was finished to appease censors.<br /><br />the story itself is original and well written and the directing is complemented by the fine acting.(nicholas lea makes his x-files debut though not as agent krycek but as a victim called michael) i especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending itself.<br /><br />its different but enjoyable.ignore any bad reviews you may hear.watch it for yourself and make judgement then
