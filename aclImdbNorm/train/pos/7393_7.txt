this movie was an impressive one. my first experience with a foreign film, it was neither too long, nor too complex. i myself enjoyed the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. the story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first, but it proved to be very touching and realistic. there was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience.
