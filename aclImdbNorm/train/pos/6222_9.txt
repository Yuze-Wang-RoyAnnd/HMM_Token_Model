this really is a great movie. some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever. but basically, all of fred and ginger's movies are the same. after the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott? his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again. he adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. he has a winning personality and a great smile. randy is in my top ten all time favorites list. it's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. ok, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars: errol flynn, alan ladd, victor mature, etc. he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions. all of fred and ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him.
