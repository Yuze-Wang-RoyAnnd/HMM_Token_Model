as i watched this movie i began to feel very nostalgic. as a child growing up in a rural area i felt as if i was a kid again! the swimming pond (it's called a "tank" in central texas), the running through the countryside like a wild free spirit! the story was very believable and i totally lost it and cried toward the end. through the pain we go through in life...life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
