what a great movie! this is so reminiscent of the wonderful disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's. i was so pleasantly surprised, after the past 20 years of absolute detritus disney's live productions crews have churned out.<br /><br />this movie is an absolute joy. the child stars were just that; professional, quality actors. i am most impressed with the quality of this movie.<br /><br />sigourney weaver was a total sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys. siobhan fallon was wonderful as the star's mother.<br /><br />i won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb! this work reminds you what it's like to be a child, without going all sugary or being too grim. the deleted scenes featured on the dvd version were truly best left deleted. they were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it. while the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent. it was best that way.<br /><br />this was an absolutely delightful movie to watch.<br /><br />it gets a 9/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
