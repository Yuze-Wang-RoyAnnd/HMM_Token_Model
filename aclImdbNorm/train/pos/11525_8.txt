this movie is awesome for three main reasons. it is esthetically beautiful. i absolutely loved that. there is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets. a photography which looks very costly (and probably was not) completes the look . i always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits/loners coming together and becoming a family . sometimes they fall into clich'es but this one does not. this group of actors really portrays well flawed, yet extremely likable characters. alan larkin is the best (between him , the van and the road movie theme, i could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year little miss sunshine
