forget depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door, and have a great time with this maniacally funny, totally absurdist, ultra-campy live-action "cartoon". mystery men is a send-up of every superhero flick you've ever seen, but its unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied, and well-cast that they are memorable characters in their own right. dark humor, downright silliness, bona fide action, and even a touching moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner. the comedic talents of the actors playing the mystery men -- including one mystery woman -- are a perfect foil for wes studi as what can only be described as a bargain-basement yoda, and geoffrey rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarrely charming) villains ever to walk off the pages of a dark horse comic book and onto the big screen. get ready to laugh, cheer, and say "huh?" more than once.... enjoy!
