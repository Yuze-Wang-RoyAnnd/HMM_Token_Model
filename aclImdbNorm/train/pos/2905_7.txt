this is a very funny movie, easy to watch, that entertains you almost all the time. the work of the director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark. the movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon, but the jokes and comedy are of argentinian sort. the twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by peretti and has to go with detective diaz (played by luque) on his assignments while he also assist him (diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him). some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide: understandable and laughable anywhere. is very good overall, it would deserved an 8, but i rated 7 because it gets a little down at the end. on a personal remark i must add that is a "bravo" for argentinian filmmakers, considering the little good is coming lately.
