as a westerner watching another culture's view and tradition of marriag, i found just married mesmerizing and delightful. the idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. yet this is the case in this hindi film. told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of abhay and ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. as said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. we see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. we see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. there's song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching.
