yokai monsters: spook warfare (yokai daisenso, 2005) a movie about "yokai" or traditional japanese "monsters" of folklore. it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on parade.<br /><br />the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak, kappa water imp, a living 'brella, a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face on the back of her head, a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd-like wrist, & so on.<br /><br />these sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore, but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era, comparable to today's halloween haunted houses, or the "freak shows" of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks. ghosts & goldfish monsters & dancing one-headed umbrellas were trumped up to create "chills" during the hot summers. the fatcheek woman & such were recreated by tricks or illusions, based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; & if their design for the movie is a bit simple & hoky, this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills.<br /><br />these rather endearing monsters have to face off & destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan & disguised himself as a samurai lord. despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy, & too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak, it is all played very poker-faced & is very charming. it has some beautiful cinematography, much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade. viewed in the right mood or with the right friends, it is exciting, moving & touching.<br /><br />yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf & cub: white heaven & hell (1974) &and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy. the yokai monsters series is not the equal of majin at its best, but the yokai are nevertheless great fun. the first miike movie which is the most child-oriented of his family films, with the gozu & izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers.
