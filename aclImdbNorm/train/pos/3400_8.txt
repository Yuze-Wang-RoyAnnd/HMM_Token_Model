domini enfilren (marlene dietrich) has spent most of her life caring for her father. now that he has died she is free--but doesn't know what she wants. boris androvsky (charles boyer) is a monk who has fled a monastery to taste more of life. they meet accidentally in algiers, fall in love and get married. but he can't leave his past behind and she can't live without him...<br /><br />way overdone romance full of hysterically bad dialogue and situations. dietrich and boyer do their best to give good performances but nobody could get away with some of their lines! still, in a way, it is a classic. it's shot in gorgeous technicolor (try to see it on dvd) where every frame is breath-takingly beautiful. dietrich is always dressed to the 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and strikes hysterical poses to show off the clothes and her body. boyer just walks around looking stricken (no shock there). still i was never bored. it was wonderful to look at and the non-stop stupid dialogue kept me in stitches. the end almost had me falling out of my chair because i was laughing so hard! now i love corny romances and give them plenty of space but really---this is unbelievable! it also runs a very short 80 minutes.<br /><br />as a camp classic i give this an 8. as a serious movie--a 1.
