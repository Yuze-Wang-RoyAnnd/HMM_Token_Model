many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie (gackt, hyde, and wang lee hom is very famous singer in japan). but don't judge it before you watch, is what i say. gackt and staff are very serious when made this film, and they worked so hard. it's a good film with a touchy story inside. several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. they made it so good until i can't stop watching this all over again. <br /><br />the story has written pretty well but i admit that their act are little disappointing. this is especially for hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language (japan). but, it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie.<br /><br />i think gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life. when toshi was killed, when sho asked kei to turn yi-che to being vampire like him because he won't let her die, when sho's brother died, kei shoot son die, and the best and beautiful scene is when sho pass away~ even i told that hyde's skill is still weird but i give him two thumps up at that scene!!<br /><br />there's a time where the plot goes too fast like they didn't tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and being sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also son is sho's brother in law.<br /><br />whatever, i love this movie~ (very much ^^). <br /><br />this is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.
