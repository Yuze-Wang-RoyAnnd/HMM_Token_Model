i've known about bettie page for many a year now. the soft-core porn images of her from the 1950's have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today. the "bettie page" look is also still hugely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then. so i watched this film with quite a bit of familiarity to begin with. the result did not disappoint.<br /><br />among other things, it was hugely entertaining to see the movie's recreation of actual figures like irving klaw, john willie, and bunny yeager
