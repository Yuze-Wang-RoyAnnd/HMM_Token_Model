this one-minute film is arguably the first movie ever made. other inventors had previously filmed actions - like edison's motion photography of a sneeze - but the lumiere brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium. at the time, of course, their `cinematograph' must have bewildered their peers, including their subjects. in this first instance, the brothers record employees leaving their factory, some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the camera. the lumieres attempt to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle, but `la sortie des usines lumiere' doesn't nearly match the ingenuity of their later films. the most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers' selection of a familiar working class ritual as their subject. their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world's people, a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today.<br /><br />rating: 8
