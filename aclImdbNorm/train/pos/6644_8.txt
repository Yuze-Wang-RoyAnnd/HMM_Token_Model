after too many years of waiting, anne rivers siddons' noted 1979 book "the house next door" has finally been filmed. the result veers a bit from the novel which, especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it's a tv film, the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good, just not as great as the book, one of stephen king's favorites and one of mine as well.<br /><br />with more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release, all the richness inherent in the original three-part story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured, especially the climactic revelation near the very end.<br /><br />still, the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence. there are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed. actually, one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next-door amateur-artist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvas.<br /><br />be sure to read the great novel.
