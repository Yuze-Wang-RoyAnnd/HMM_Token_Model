the concept of having laurel & hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious. it guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially stan laurel of course as usual.<br /><br />the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. it doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending. it's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless, so it works for the movie.<br /><br />the supporting cast of the movie is surprising good. sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor.<br /><br />the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences, which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed. it all helps to make "dirty work" to be one of the better laurel & hardy shorts.<br /><br />8/10
