well i don't personally like rap, but i still found fear of a black hat hilarious. i'm sure i didn't get some inside jokes, but some i knew, and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after i'd stopped laughing. i'm a big fan of spinal tap, so naturally i had to check this out. it was deriviative from this is spinal tap, sometimes blatantly, but this film still stood on it's own as an original, intelligent, and funny satire. my personal favorite: "back in the time of slaves, they didn't have hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt. now we have hats."
