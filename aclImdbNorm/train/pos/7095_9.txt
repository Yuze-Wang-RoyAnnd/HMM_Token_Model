terry gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of chris marker's short film la jetee is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast. gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by david and janet peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor james cole (willis at his most steve mcqueen-like -- better than mcqueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals. willis, the justifiably oscar-nominated brad pitt, and madeline stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers. even paul buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting. this one's a don't-miss!
