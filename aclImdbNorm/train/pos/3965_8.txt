the film as entertainment is very good and jimmy stewart is excellent as chip hardesty, with well done co-starring turns by vera miles and murray hamilton. but the film, directed by legendary director mervyn leroy, was constantly vetted and script approval as well as every aspect of the film, down to clothing, was closely watched and controlled by j. edgar hoover. not that j. edgar hoover didn't have something to be proud of. his management of the bureau from 1924 to his death crated on of the finest investigative services in the world. but by 1959 hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started to collect dossiers on powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom. and he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single wart about the bureau. the films shows only continued successes and glosses over the failures which occurred, and the bureau's part in the witch hunts of the early 1950's. enjoy the story, but with tongue firmly in cheek.
