winchester 73 is the story of a man (jimmy stewart) obsessed with getting back his prized possession, a repeating rifle made by winchester. the rifle keeps changing hands, and stewart doggedly keeps after it. this 1950 b&w effort by anthony mann is more a crime film than a traditional western, and the cowboys often seem more like modern-day gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. shelley winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man (charles drake) she may marry. she ends up falling for stewart, but not before she is passed around a bit. winters is the most complex character in a film filled with unusual characters. watch for a young dan dureyea as a nutty killer and tony curtis in a very small role. a woefully miscast will geer plays wyatt earp.
