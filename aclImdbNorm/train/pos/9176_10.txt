this review comes nearly 30 years late. nevertheless, it has to be mentioned that i chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight! i just had to write about it! i got smitten and forgot anything else existed once i saw this movie. how ironic it is to see literature's ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man! yet, what a welcome irony! it suited me perfectly and more so because timothy dalton did full justice to his role. he delivered an astounding and triumphant performance! i have never seen anything like it! all the other actors are very good too. the whole movie was put together beautifully. i don't care what anyone says about this movie. i just love it and love it! it made me happy and satisfied. it crushes me a bit to say this but i prefer jane eyre 1983 to a&e's p&j, which i believe is the ultimate mini-series. <br /><br />the excerpts from jane eyre spooked me a little back in school. i never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well. seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy. the scenes and mr. dalton's voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously, which, of course is a masterpiece. bravo to the whole team and especially to mr.dalton!! this movie is now a part of me.<br /><br />i give it 10/10 rating.
