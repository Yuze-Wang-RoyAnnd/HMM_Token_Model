red eye starts in texas where hotel receptionist lisa reisert (rachel mcadams) is about to catch the last 'red eye' flight back to miami where she lives & works. while waiting for her plane lisa meets the handsome & charming jackson rippner (cillian murphy) & they both seem to hit it off, then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other. once the plane takes off & they are in the air jackson reveals who he really is & that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence, jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary charles keefe (jack scalia) & they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in miami. jackson tells lisa to phone the hotel & make it happen or her father will be killed...<br /><br />directed by wes craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as the last house on the left (1972), a nightmare on elm street (1984), the serpent and the rainbow (1989), the people under the stairs (1991) & the scream trilogy of teen slashers a short, punchy, fast paced little thriller like red eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film craven usually makes. the script by carl ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that i must admit i really enjoyed, at only 85 odd minutes in length it's a very quick moving, economical & straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight, taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots. some may like this approach like i did while other's may not but i think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick & fast without the film slowing down any & giving you a chance to relax. i really liked the plot for red eye, sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell, it's a film made to entertain & for me that's what it did. i really liked the two central character's, lisa comes across as very likable while jackson rippner (an obvious play on the name of the notorious victorian serial killer jack the ripper) is a suitably slimy villain with a cold 'i'm only doing my job' type mentality. another plus point is that i didn't think anyone behaved overly stupid here, everyone actually seemed like human beings & the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion. i really liked this & it's one of craven's better more recent films.<br /><br />craven turns in a good solid tense, tight, taught & fast paced thriller with an attractive cast, some good action & a gripping plot. he certainly doesn't hang about & once he starts the action & tension he never lets up, far & away the most effective part of the film is when rippner is holding lisa hostage on the plane & once the film switches to miami & lisa's fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it's still good. a special mention goes to rachel mcadams who is absolutely gorgeous in this, i could probably watch red eye again just because she is in it & looks drop dead stunning. those who see wes craven's name attached to red eye expecting a horror film should think again since there's no horror in it at all (despite the imdb listing 'horror' as red eye's genre). i am not sure about the ending, on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see lisa kill him in some way.<br /><br />dreamworks apparently gave red eye an initial budget of $44,000,000 but reduced it to $25,000,000 although it's still a very well made film with glossy production values. actually shot in los angeles & florida in california. the film was supposedly written with husband & wife sean penn & robin wright penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads. as i have already said rachel mcadams is pure eye candy & is a total babe in this & worth watching the film for on her own. oh, & she puts in a decent performance too.<br /><br />red eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that i enjoyed immensely, i didn't think i would enjoy it as much as i did & i am glad i decided to watch it. this definitely gets a recommendation from me & rachel mcadams really is hot stuff in this...
