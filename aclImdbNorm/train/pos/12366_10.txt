wonderful film, one of the best horror films of the 70s. she is realistic settings and atmospheres. as usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments. i have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency. obviously because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati, is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here.<br /><br />before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment. in the film a good gift because 10 is really well done. raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of kubrick films. he really impression. excellent film really. i consider a film anthology of years'70.
