i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it). i don't remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade, a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head :) (todd schaefer, kenny johnson and kevin mcparland). i also remember the last scene when jennifer mcallister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. it's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. but where do i find it? how can i download it?
