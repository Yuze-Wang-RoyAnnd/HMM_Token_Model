super mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break. i've beaten the game 4 times, but i've never gotten all 120 stars...(i've gotten 111)...but i hope to achieve them eventually. even though i didn't officially play this game until i was seven in, i loved watching my sisters play it. now i am 13 and still play this, erasing games and starting over again.<br /><br />the graphics are unbelievable for an early n64 game. the gameplay is addictive. the controls are great. the levels are tough, but not impossible. the bowser fights are challenging.<br /><br />i would like to tell you more, but why don't you just get it for yourself? put the x-box 360, ps3, and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo 64 and play this amazing, wonderful game.
