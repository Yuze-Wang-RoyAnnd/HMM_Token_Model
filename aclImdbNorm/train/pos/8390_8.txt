my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience. film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match.<br /><br />there were many cliches used in the film, but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing. sound was also brilliant (sometimes back being louder than dialogue).<br /><br />everything seemed to be in right place. and i loved the way how after-war-time was presented. real fun!<br /><br />
