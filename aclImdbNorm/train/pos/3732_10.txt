producer joel schumacher who also directed "phone booth",'02, and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into combat!! colin farrell(roland bozz),"intermission",'03, gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back. matthew davis(jim paxton),"blue crush",'02, gave a great supporting role and shea whigham(pvt.wilson),"all the real girls",'03, showed his true acting skills in the role that he played. there was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. one army veteran instructor from viet nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. enjoyable and entertaining film to view.
