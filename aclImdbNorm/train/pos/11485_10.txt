zero day leads you to think, even re-think why two boys/young men would do what they did - commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates. it captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their own/mutual world via coupled destruction.<br /><br />it is not a perfect movie but given what money/time the filmmaker and actors had - it is a remarkable product. in terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide/murderers it is better than 'elephant' - in terms of being a film that gets under our 'rationalistic' skin it is a far, far better film than almost anything you are likely to see. <br /><br />flawed but honest with a terrible honesty.
