double exposure was a tremendous surprise. it contains outstanding acting (particularly from the underrated callan), fine cinematography and a compelling storyline. in other words, it's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s.<br /><br />callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models, at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother (who happens to be missing an arm and a leg). when the models callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead, the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity... but there is more to the picture than he is seeing.<br /><br />this film never received the praise it deserves. most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time, but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot. it's clever and unique, which isn't something one can comfortably say about most films of this genre, but it's also passionately crafted and performed. double exposure is a gem of its kind.
