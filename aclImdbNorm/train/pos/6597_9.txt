we always watch american movies with their particular accents from each region (south, west, etc). we have the same here. all foreign people must to watch this movie and need to have a open mind to accept another culture, besides american and european almost dominate the cinematographic industry.<br /><br />this movie tell us about a parallel world which it isn't figured even for those who live in a big city like s~ao paulo. all actors are improvising and they are very realistic. the camera give us an idea of their confuse world, the loneliness of each character and invite us to share their world.<br /><br />it's a real great movie and worst a rent even have it at home.
