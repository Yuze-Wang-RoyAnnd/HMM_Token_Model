generally, it's difficult to rate these cut-&-paste films. some of the segments can be quite good while others bring down the rating of the overall product. in this one, for instance, the all-girl scene in the doctor's office was quite exciting...one of the best in this viewer's (limited) viewing history. then there's asia's segment... the lady is always entertaining. and the story that binds the whole together was an interesting concept. the swap scene that closes out the offering ain't bad either. technically, the production values are fairly high. recommended.
