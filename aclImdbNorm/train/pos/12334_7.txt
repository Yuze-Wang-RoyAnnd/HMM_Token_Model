does anyone happen to know where this film was shot? the aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful. it appears to be england. however, ivy's apartment building certainly looks like the brill building, with its fascinating elevators.<br /><br />charles mendl is listed as playing "sir charles gage". maybe i blinked, but i never saw him. perhaps he was the husband's lawyer, but, again, i don't recall that character being in the film, other than being mentioned as having made a phone call. perhaps he was in the aviation scene? or the ballroom scene? did anyone spot him?<br /><br />herbert marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film.
