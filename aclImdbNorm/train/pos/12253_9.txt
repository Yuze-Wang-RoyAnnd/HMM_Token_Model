this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel. although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular "pride and prejudice," "emma" is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen's novel -- especially considering its short length. the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one, as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma's character in the rest of the book. i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well-picked. kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow's '96 version. samantha morton's wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book. mister knightly's role is carried out extremely well in my opinion; both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much-neglected, sumptuous film.
