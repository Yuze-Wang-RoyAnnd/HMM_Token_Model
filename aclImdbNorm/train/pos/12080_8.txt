julia ross (nina foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in cornwall. when she awakens they keep telling her she's marion hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? you'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is fun.<br /><br />along with "the narrow margin" and "face behind the mask" this is one of the best b pictures ever made. (b pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). it's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), is well-directed, fast paced and exciting. it only stumbles at the end which i found a bit too implausible to buy.<br /><br />foch (a good actress) is just ok in the lead but dame may witty is great and george macready is excellent (and frightening) as the villains. well worth catching. a perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget.
