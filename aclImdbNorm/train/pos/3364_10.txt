i too was quite astonished to see how few people had voted on this film, and just had to write something about it, although my comments are quite similar to those written already.<br /><br />i like many things about the film. the superb acting between mastroianni & loren. the way the film is narrated: humanity and love slowly developing between these two outsiders, and contrasted to the simultaneously & continuously ongoing inhumane marching pace of the fascist radio announcer (who happens to be a colleague of mastroianni's part)and the adherents "going to and coming from the show". to me this is a very fine film about what it is to be human. maybe some of you would argue that the anti-fascist "message" is too clearly delivered, but to me this didn't destroy the film in any way. my vote is 10/10.
