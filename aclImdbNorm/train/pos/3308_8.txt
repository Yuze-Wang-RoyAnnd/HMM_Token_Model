the power of kangwon province is director hong sang-soo's second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film, including the multiple connected narratives (in this case, two), and stories of troubled or troubling relationships, as well as a potent dosage of irony.<br /><br />one thing that's clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism. however, this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein. the two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to kangwon province with her friends, only to find herself drawn to a stranger, the second about a man who also goes on a trip to kangwon province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes.<br /><br />again, hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet i don't think he's entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters, drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony. i think the think i've come to love about hong's films is that they just feel so real, especially the complex and conflicted characters. not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings, but rather, that these characters he and the actors present, feel fully developed and believable.<br /><br />this is not a fast moving film. there's a lot of lingering and like the previous film, things don't always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways. there doesn't appear to be any element of the film that isn't intentionally placed in the film and it's made my a little hyper-aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses.<br /><br />power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion, regret, longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision-making. it's a rather hard balance to keep and it's surprising how hong manages to pull it off twice in a row. technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear. this film doesn't pack the same emotional wallop that the first does, but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision. great viewing for art cinema lovers. 8/10.
