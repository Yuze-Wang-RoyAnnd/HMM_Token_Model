what a lovely heart warming television movie. the story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope. her mother is also very distressed ..only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness.which all viewers hope will materialise. samantha mathis is brilliant as the little girl's mum ,as she was as the nanny in" jack and sarah",worth watching if you like both samantha mathis and happy; year tear jerking movies! ellen burstyn is, as, always a delightful grandmother in this tender and magnificently acted movie. jodelle ferland (the little five year old) is charming and a most convincing young actress. the film is based on a true story which makes it so touching."mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human kindness which is clearly illustrated and clearly is still all around us in this difficult world we live in. "mermaid" gives us all hope ,by realising that there a lot of lovely people in the world with lot's of love to give. james robson glasgow scotland u.k.
