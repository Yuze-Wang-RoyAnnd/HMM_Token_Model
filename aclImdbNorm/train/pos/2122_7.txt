back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made. good old all american james stewart appearing as a hungarian in the shop around the corner. had i been casting the film, the part of kralik would have been perfect for charles boyer. his accent mixed in with all the other european accents would have been nothing. stewart had some of the same problem in the mortal storm also with margaret sullavan.<br /><br />margaret sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her. but is only this one where neither of them dies. sullavan and her husband leland heyward knew stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in new york. in fact sullavan's husband was stewart's good friend henry fonda back then.<br /><br />i think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non-americans in mutiny on the bounty. stewart in the mortal storm was german, but all the other players were american as well so nothing stood out. <br /><br />but if you can accept stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from ernest lubitsch. the plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in budapest don't get along in person. but it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other. also employer frank morgan suspects stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife. <br /><br />though the leads are fine and frank morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are felix bressart and joseph schildkraut. bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after morgan starts asking people for opinions. he makes himself very scarce.<br /><br />and joseph schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to frank morgan. you really hate people like that, i've known too many like schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day. sad that it pays off a good deal of the time.
