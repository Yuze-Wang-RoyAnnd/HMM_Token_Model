i've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life (eg what it takes to get into music school), britney bashing, etc, etc. so let's focus on the movie and the message.<br /><br />i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. for the average adult male.... 2 out of 10.<br /><br />i like pop/rock music, i'm 45. i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews. i didn't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any 'self promotion'.<br /><br />i watch movies to be entertained. i don't care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. what is the movie and does it entertain me.<br /><br />i watched this movie for the message. the world's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem (which is a whole other story) so watched with the message in mind, as that is an area of interest. the movie is light, bright and breezy, great for kids. i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don't give up message, so yeh, it was a bit predictable. great message though...should be more of them.<br /><br />this movie is a great family movie, but for a bloke watching by himself, get hannibal.
