there are so many words i want to use to describe this movie, but can't really do that can i? this movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. i'm serious. don't watch this movie if you're easily offended by profanity, sex, nudity, homosexuality...and everything else associated with nature. being a woman, and that might not even be a factor, i can watch this movie over and over again. trey parker and matt stone are absolutely brilliant. along with all their other debuts, i think baseketball is the prize winner. i'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie. watch the movie!! that's all i'm going to say. it's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because i'm one of those people, like ozzy osbourne, who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak. so i'm keeping it professional. best movie. heck yeah!!
