despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of most uninspiring disney films i've seen, and i don't slam disney films very often. spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured, either by the cavalry or by indians, both of which try to "break" him. spirit ends up forming a bond with the indian, and that, in a nutshell, is the story. with exception to the beautiful animation of the horses, neither i or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film. it's ironic that it's titled "spirit", as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of. an extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by bryan adams and hans zimmer. and although this film is rated g, you will still probably have to end up explaining what "breaking a horse" means to your five year old. i did.<br /><br />
