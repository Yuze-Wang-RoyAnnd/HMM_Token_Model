oh it's so cool to watch a silent classic once in while! director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy (at least for 1928) cameo as himself. the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you. marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger "drama" studio. she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world. for a moment she even denies her (poor) past! the cameos are simply hilarious, certainly the scene where the main character (marion davies) sees...marion davies in the studios and concludes she doesn't seem that special... it's got to be one of the first movie-in-the-movies here and for real freaks it's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then. a must-see if you ask me!!
