i barely remember this show, a little ,but i remembered it was great! my eldest brother, reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an advertisement for the d.v.d set coming out. the network, again screwed up in pulling this from the air, so that they could put what else in it's place? it should have gone at least 3 seasons. why not, right? i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the 'gods' of the entertainment world. but they mis-guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time. let it be said that, they have a lot more flops than 'hits'. this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line-up. anyhow, i am getting this for my collection.
