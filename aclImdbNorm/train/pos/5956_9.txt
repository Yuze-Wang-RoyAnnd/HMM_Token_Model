yes, this is an ultra-low budget movie. so the acting isn't award winning material and at times the action is slow-paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie. this film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously, explains it and develops a full plot out of it. aside from the vampire story, we get detailed genetics info, legal and law enforcement, martial arts action, philosophical musings, and some good metal music. kudos go to dylan o'leary, the director/writer/main actor. it is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well. i think to appreciate this movie, you have to be well-versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things. there are some great camera work, too, interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack- something i haven't seen before, but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in fulci's zombi. the casting is good, in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed. the main vampire also looks perfect for the role. the female victim looks vulnerable. my only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick, there should have been more nudity. if you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this flick is for you. i'm looking forward to seeing future projects by mr. o'leary.
