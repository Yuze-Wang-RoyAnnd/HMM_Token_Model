i saw this movie with my dad. i must have been pretty young, around 15. it was on star movies one afternoon.the movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. it really caught pace after the first half hour.<br /><br />all the actors are great, especially blades and lou diamond. i guess it's the ensemble, they just play so well together. i can watch this film anytime.i think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score. the jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious.<br /><br />a perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
