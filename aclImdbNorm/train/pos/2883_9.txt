"cinderella" is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried. once her father died, cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house, like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters. one day the king sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the royal ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. of course, cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did. cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the royal ball, until her fairy godmother appeared. so she did some magic and made cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back. while at the royal ball, cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. then the king orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper. the duke searched every house, but finally found the women who it belonged to, cinderella.<br /><br />clyde geronimi, wilfred jackson, and hamilton luske directed one of the best animated disney films in 1950. this film is about a magical fairytale. in the beginning of the film cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her, but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love.<br /><br />my favorite thing about "cinderella" is the music. when cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic, she sang the song bibbidi bobbidi boo. when i was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so i will never forget it. i also loved the part when cinderella and the prince were singing the song so this is love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love. overall this film was my favorite film when i was a little child because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale life.
