the group of people are travelling to belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation`s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes. the man who "steals the show" is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him. in the end, the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan`s song of a dying country.
