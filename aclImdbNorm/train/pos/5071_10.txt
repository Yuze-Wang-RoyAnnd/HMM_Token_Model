i saw this movie on the hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful, especially since it was based on a true man. pierce brosnan was very good as the loner english man who took on the persona of the half breed grey owl. the photography was beautiful.<br /><br />this movie made me do more research into this character archie belaney known simple as grey owl. i want to read as much as i can about him. at the time i did not know richard attenborough had directed it. but i am not surprised. i like all his movies whether he is acting or directing. i gave it the highest rating. however, i would have liked to have seen more in the movie about why he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house.<br /><br />you can't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes.
