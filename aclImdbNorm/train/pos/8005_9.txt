i bought this game on ebay having heard that it was a similar game to elite. the gameplay is indeed very similar, and is very addictive. once i'd played it a couple of times, i immediately went back on ebay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too.... i have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie, it's brilliant. if you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single-player game, simply set up a freelancer server on your own pc (easy to do and the software is included) and play to your heart's content. there are still a huge number of freelancer servers on the internet, so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatening, because you don't often meant other players unless you want to. so go get a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single-player campaign, then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself. the depth of this game is staggering, with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is nearly endless. fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on ebay. get one with the full written manual if you can (blue box, not xplosiv red box), it's loads better!
