this film, as low budget as it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers i've ever seen. if you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can appreciate just how good of a story it is, how very well written the script is, and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money.<br /><br />all the elements of a great film are here. the visuals, though shot on digital, were gorgeous in places. the bizarre, dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just amazing. it's such a trippy piece of work, but not done in a pretentious way, and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film. it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there.
