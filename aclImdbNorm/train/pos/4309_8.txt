a lot of the comments people have made strike me as (sorry) missing the point. kasdan wants to present life, simply, ordinary life. the conventionally structured story, where characters have insights that change their lives, and then fade out, music up, and the film is over, is absorbed into this much larger canvas. several characters in this movie have just such illuminations, and then they move on. sometimes they can hold onto their insights, sometimes they can't, and that's the way life really is. in other words, kasdan jettisons conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the ongoingness of life
