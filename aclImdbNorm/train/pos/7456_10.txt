don't get me wrong. "goldeneye" was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise. but the series had fallen into a fps rut. enter "everything or nothing", which puts bond in third-person. when i wrote my earlier review for "from russia with love", i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly. even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise, eon definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety. missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an suv, driving an aston martin, driving a limousine that is wired to explode, commandeering two different types of tanks a la "goldeneye", riding a motorcycle, flying a helicopter, repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires, and free falling after a plummeting damsel. sure, vehicle controls are a little clumsy, but the issue here is the variety.<br /><br />as movie adaptations, "goldeneye" and frwl were all that i could have hoped for. but eon's original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure. this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe, shannon elizabeth, heidi klum, and misaki ito. judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q, respectively, and pierce brosnan, while no sean connery, adds credibility to the game's proceedings. all characters resemble the stars, with the disappointing exception of heidi klum, who's in-game model doesn't do the real-life model justice. mya's theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes.<br /><br />the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies. willem defoe's character is a former colleague of christopher walken's baddie from "a view to a kill". richard kiel appears as jaws, the hulking henchman from "the spy who loved me" and "moonraker" in three fight scenes, the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have.<br /><br />single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as bond. like bond, you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing. the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth, with plenty of wall and object cover. unfortunately, unlike frwl, only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging, so bond may end up crouching low when he's supposed to be peeking around a corner, and vice-versa. the game also allows players to go into "bond reflex" mode. while you browse your inventory, everything around you will go into super slo-mo, allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with. while this takes some getting used to, eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular "bond moments", such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath, and greatly add to the bond movie feeling.<br /><br />there are 3 available difficulty levels: operative, agent, and double oh. on operative, you can breeze through in a few hours. on agent, a few weeks. on double oh, a few months. the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission. garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear. some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints, but when all is said and done, no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie.<br /><br />multi-player, unfortunately, is not as thrilling. "goldeneye" still has the best multi-player mode of any bond game. eon's main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond's. a more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode. but the single-player mode is the most complete bond experience to date. the ending, as with most bond games, is anticlimactic. while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game, the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing. also, levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error. still, for any serious bond fan, not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films.
