this movie stars emily watson, of breaking the waves fame. this movie about one man's obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is being held. a chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by emily watson. she falls for this oddball of a man, who is obsessed with chess. this is all at the dismay of her mother, who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; a proper gentleman. her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman, as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such. what ensues is mostly a journey through the man's psyche. it tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present. emily watson is amazing in this, as well as the actor who plays the main character. it is definitely slow, but is well worth the watching. the ending was even satisfying. :)
