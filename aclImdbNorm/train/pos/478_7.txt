i'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert, luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience.
