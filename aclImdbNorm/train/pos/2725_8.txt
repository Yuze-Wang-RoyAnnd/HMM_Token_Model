"in cold blood", adapted by director richard brooks from truman capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals. the film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger-man perry smith (robert blake).<br /><br />the cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease. robert blake and scott wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities. they play off of each other effortlessly while blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies. the rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on.<br /><br />richard brooks received oscar nominations for both his script and his direction. in my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some ill-advised narration in the late stages. the oscar-nominated cinematography by conrad hall is also top-notch, as is the editing. also worthy of note is the jazzy score by quincy jones which secured the last of the film's four oscar nominations.<br /><br />unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence. brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual hollywood approach. i recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.
