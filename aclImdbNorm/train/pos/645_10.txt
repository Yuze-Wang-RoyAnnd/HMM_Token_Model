i hate over-long over-talky french movies, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all. i saw it twice in the mid-70's, and then it disappeared. but i finally got to see it again in 1999, and fell in love all over again. what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago. if you haven't seen it, don't miss your chance!
