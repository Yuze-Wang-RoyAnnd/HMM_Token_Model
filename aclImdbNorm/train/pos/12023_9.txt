a shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern british films, one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the criteria that american films are judged. britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it, but at warmth british films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor.<br /><br />this film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor, so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers. it's a couple of decades later, gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind. he teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses. when students he's fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether he's just all talk.<br /><br />this is a subversive film in that there's not the usual worldly character of any american movie that you expect to do whatever he does, but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles. maybe. it's certainly no protest-by-numbers though, being too warm. where u.s. film may seem realistic because they're urban and gritty, this and other british films of recent years - those that don't try to match america for visceral thrills - are real because british humour reveals truths.
