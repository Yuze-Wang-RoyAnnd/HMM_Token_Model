it was "the night he came home," warned the posters for john carpenter's career-making horror classic. set in a small american town, halloween centerers around serial killer michael myers' attempts to track down his sister laurie strode, and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal ways...leaving poor laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible michael. this plot out-line inspired countless horror knock-offs throughout the 80s, 90s and continues to do so today, as well as a poorly received 2007 remake. the difference between them, and this, is, quite simply, that "halloween" is the best.<br /><br />made on a very modest, tight budget...halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub-genre of "sexually promiscuous-teens getting stalked by a knife/axe/chainsaw/ wielding psycho".
