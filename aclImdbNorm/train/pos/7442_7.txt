i rented the film (i don't think it got a theatrical release here) out expecting the worse. the previews made the film look awful. i was in fact very surprised, it was well worth watching; it was loosely scripted, almost like an ensemble piece of film. it had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing. it is flawed, mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning 'comedy' effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or larry sanders way.<br /><br />at the moment it is the fashion to be critical of jerry springer, he is also an easy target. springer could have made citizen kane and it would be proclaimed 'the worst film ever made'. i recommend this film for anybody interested in the show. a flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film.
