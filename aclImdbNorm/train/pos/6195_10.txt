after seeing this film months ago, it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and i feel i must buy it or at least see it again, even though i watched it at least 3 times when i rented it at that point.<br /><br />i fell in love with hal hartley's directing many years ago - i found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained. it is a strange feeling, granted, and i assume most people out there really just don't get it, or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - i guess i just really get it - its as if these films were made for me.<br /><br />although i don't remember if i actually laughed out loud during this film, it remains one of the funniest films i've seen in many years. if you don't see the humor of the grocery bag fay carries from the street to a church, to her brother's publisher's office, to her son's principal's office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film. the bag is a silent character in itself, being dragged around as an icon of motherhood the usually brash, bitchy parker posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film besets her.<br /><br />i consider "henry fool" my least favorite of hartley's films. i honestly don't remember it very well - i think the character himself was so despicable i found it tedious. hartley's forte seems to be feminine character development.<br /><br />aside from posey's brilliance, it was wonderful to see elina lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses, again. her extravagant naivet'e is perfect for hartley's direction. his ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughout.<br /><br />this film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story, explaining political situations in afganistan. this is never suspected at the beginning. the complexity of this film's development is unparalleled.<br /><br />this is the epitome of a "stand alone" sequel. the less you know about henry fool the more mystery is spun around him, the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film - as an alcoholic chain-smoking complaint machine, hurling insults at his islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him. its like finding out santa claus is actually a 12-year-old schoolyard bully.<br /><br />although i was impressed and satisfied with hartley's other recent films "the girl from monday" and "no such thing", "fay grim" goes far beyond what i expected, with a sense of humor and originality no oscar winner would ever dare.
