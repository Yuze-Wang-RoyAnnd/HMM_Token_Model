i caught this film late on a sat night/ sunday morning with my brother. we had been drinking. this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen. from the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film rocks!! the continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it, it slaps you in the face with the holes. in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. cut to his son and new girlfriend (the ships pr director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true)on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion. ......then the dad is there hugging them. how???? who cares, its magic. there is not one redeeming feature to this film. the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide, you've guessed it. enter the villains who, instead of checking under the one table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and 'take them out'.<br /><br />get some mates over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and howl.
