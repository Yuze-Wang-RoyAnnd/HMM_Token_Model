this is a great movie for any fan of hong kong action movies. asides from it's little plot, the weak drama and bits of comedy antics, the movie is action packed with gun-fighting and martial arts action. kept me entertained from beginning until the end. i thought shannon lee was awesome in the movie.<br /><br />having an action director like corey yuen is what keeps hong kong action going strong. this modern action film is highly recommended!!
