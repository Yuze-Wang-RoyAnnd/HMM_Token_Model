this is one of the movies of dev anand who gave great yet distinct movies to hindi movie industries such as jewel thief and guide. the story is short (if you ask me what is the story), plot is simple- a brother seeks for his lost sister. sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant hare rama hare krishna. yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's.hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom ,escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern (which was new for whites) religion. they have been handled perfectly. zeenat gave her best and dev as usual was remarkable. songs are the best used (unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs) in this movie. they have not been spoiled.one perfect example is 'dekho o deewano...ram ka naam badnam na karo'. each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. the end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie. overall devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here. a must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful nepal of 70's.
