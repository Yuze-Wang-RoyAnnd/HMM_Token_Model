of the three remakes of this plot, i like them all, i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd. there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re-watchable. in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each? of course the main stars in this one are great, but the supporting actors are also superb. i particularly like william tracy as pepi. he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in. he appeared in many, but most are not available. as the other comments, i also say - buy this one.
