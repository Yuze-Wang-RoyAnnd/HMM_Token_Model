when will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world? if you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching "bill and ted's bogus journey." this is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch, keanu and alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from "bill and ted's excellent adventure" with even more 'style' then they had in 1st movie. it's not rocket science but it's great for a laugh, the characters being extremely like-able and the story-line being so radical you have to laugh. don't expect 'deep-and-meaningfulls' just expect pure fun!
