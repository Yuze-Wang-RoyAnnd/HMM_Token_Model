this is a better adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow (although i liked that one, too). it isn't so much that beckinsale is better -- they are both very good -- but that the screenplay is better. davies is a master at adapting austen for filming, and the production values here are very good. it's not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment, but it's close, and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better.
