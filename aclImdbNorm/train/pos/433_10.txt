this is one of those rare movies, it's lovely and compelling, dignified and quirky, a true gift. i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy, or any vacation at all, because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience (yup, find the magic). i especially loved josie lawrence, as lottie wilkins, but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film. further the costumes, if you're drawn to fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well done. i just wish they'd release it on dvd because i'm wearing my tape version out! <br /><br />absolutely well worth your time, just make sure to settle in to watch it, without any interruptions.
