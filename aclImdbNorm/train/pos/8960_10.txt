this may not be war & peace, but the two academy noms wouldn't have been forthcoming if it weren't for the genius of james wong howe...<br /><br />this is one of the few films i've fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without dissatisfaction. whether you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not, bb&c is a visual feast.<br /><br />i'm not saying it's his best work, i'm no expert there for sure. but the look of this movie is amazing. i love everything about it; elsa lanchester, the cat, the crazy hoo-doo, the retro-downtown-ness; but the way it was put on film is breathtaking.<br /><br />i even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above, and the "special effects" that seem backward now. it all creates a really consistent world.
