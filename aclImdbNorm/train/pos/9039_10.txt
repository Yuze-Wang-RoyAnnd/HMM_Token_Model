i grew up in southern west virginia; i'm about the same age as (or maybe a year older than) homer hickam, author of "the rocket boys," the book forming the true-story basis of this heart-warming film.<br /><br />and so i relate closely to the west virginia coal-mining theme, and to the stunning effect sputnik had at that time (october 4, 1957) on all of us. the rocket boys went on to make great lives for themselves. i went on to get my degrees in physics and computer engineering. all because sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the "science gap" the u.s.s.r. had on the u.s. in those cold war days...<br /><br />this is a wonderful film for everyone, of all ages. but if you grew up in west virginia in the late 1950's, it'll touch the core of your being.<br /><br />everyone: get it; watch it; recommend it to your friends... who'll thank you many times.
