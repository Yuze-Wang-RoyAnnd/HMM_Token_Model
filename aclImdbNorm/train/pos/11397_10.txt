timeless musical gem, with gene kelly in top form, stylish direction by vincente minnelli, and wonderful musical numbers. it is great entertainment from start to finish, one of those films that people watch with a smile and say "they don't make 'em like they used to!" but they never did quite make them like this. the climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history. movie magic, clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved. a must see!
