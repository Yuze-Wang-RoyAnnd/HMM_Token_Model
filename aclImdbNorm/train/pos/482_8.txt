this is a poem on film, wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry. it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly. (italy's lake district in the twenties.) it's a love story with a twist. the characters are unique and believable. the settings are deliciously exotic. some of the scenes --- the funeral boat in the fog --- the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor --- are beautiful images. and rather than the mandatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet one. if film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece.<br /><br />
