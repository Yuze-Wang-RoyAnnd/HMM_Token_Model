i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival, in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festival.<br /><br />i absolutely was into it. i love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes. it is amazing set-design. the scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies.<br /><br />and the music is so nice.<br /><br />i rate this experience 9/10.<br /><br />* spoilers ahead *<br /><br />the documentary tells about awesome blues-men, with black-and-white old-looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing. it is really amazing. but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary. it is the too abundant use of links to modern rock-bands playing those blues songs in a modern way. i didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome blues songs. this is the same kind of un-perfect musical taste i found when watching wim wenders buena vista social club.<br /><br />the documentary was such a standing-ovation at this first screening in the little cinema, that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the croisette at the open-air cinema. though the sand, the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night.
