this was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues. it dealt with issues of rascism and class. but, it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself. this movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny. it also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society. what others think of you is not important. i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it. the actors i think were able to convey each character wonderfully. i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. at a just glancing look you wouldn't see how deep the movie is, but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie.
