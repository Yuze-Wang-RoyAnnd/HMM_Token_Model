as a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie. there are few movies that show horsemanship as this one does. i would love to know if brian does his own riding in the film. would also like to know if he enjoys horses. brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden. where did he learn to ride? the only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding scenes are always full tilt, like a horse can run forever at full steam. the camera-work is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse. it would be very interesting to know how they went about casting this movie to find all of the very good horseback riders.
