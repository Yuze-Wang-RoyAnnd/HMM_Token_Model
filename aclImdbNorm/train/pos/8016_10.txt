don't think of this movies as just another kids movie - the whole family can enjoy it. its a strange mix of a movie, as its seems to have a movie within it, but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike modern films!) it does give you all the elements of a film (decent plot, good characters - well it does star the muppets, a list of lesser celebs* which films would clamour for) what is surprising, is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some heartwarming, some funny and some serious - it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together.<br /><br />* the celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine miss piggy!!!!
