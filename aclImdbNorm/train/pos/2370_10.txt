it's a great american martial arts movie. the fighting scenes were pretty impressive for american movie made in 90's. of course the fighting scenes aren't that good as in honk kong movies, actually only few american movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in honk kong movies, even nowadays. when you watch american martial arts movie, you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes, but still having some nice moves, which can be surprisingly good sometimes, or at least that's what i'm expecting from these movies. i was impressed by this film. some fighting scenes were really impressive, the acting, direction and the plot were good enough, so it's a really worth watching movie, if you like american martial arts films of the 90's.
