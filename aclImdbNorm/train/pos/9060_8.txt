saw this today with my 8 year old. i thought it was cute. i agree with the other poster that it wasn't anything like the book that i can remember, but we still enjoyed it. all of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining. billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day. if he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants. the beginning of the movie is set up to show that billy has a very weak stomach and pukes at almost anything. hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms. good message about standing up to bullies and of course, a sappy happy ending.
