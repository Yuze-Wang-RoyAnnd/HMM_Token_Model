my grandmother bought me this film when i was 5 (i've always love scary movies) and even then i enjoyed it. the atmosphere is awesome and the story original and entertaining. i especially love the scenes where the rv is under attack in the desert. the rocks are actually convincing for such a low-budget flick. the acting is above average for these kinds of films and the music is eerie. this is definitely an uder-rated gem. i recommend it to anyone who likes these strange films from the late seventies, early eighties such as "alice, sweet alice", "poor pretty eddie", "nightmare", "hospital massacre", and "return of the aliens, the deadly spawn". definitely a classic!!
