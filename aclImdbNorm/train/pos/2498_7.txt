i picked this up in the 'danger after dark' box set, and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt. i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue. which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america. instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that sho (gackt) develops through the movie as a person. the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good, considering they aren't professional actors, and the director did a marvelous job with it all, setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards.<br /><br />on a side note, taro yamamoto's performance was very surprising. the only other film i've seen him in is battle royale, where he plays shogo kawada, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo. toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics. shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. so, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with battle royale, you'll be very surprised by him.<br /><br />but don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box, because this isn't really a vampire movie. it's just a movie with a vampire in it. that hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene. it's a really moving picture at some points, the photography is really well done. it's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at blockbuster.
