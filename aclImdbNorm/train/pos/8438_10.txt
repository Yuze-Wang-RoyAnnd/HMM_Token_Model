hlots was an outstanding series, its what nypd blue will never be, on hlots the plots are real, the dialog is real, the relationships are real. with hlots back as a movie, tying up all the loose ends, it was good to have all the gang back together, even a few that passed away show up (wont say how) the storyline was fast paced, emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out. homicide , life on the streets, network drama at its best!!!! 5 stars!!!! thumbs up and all that. thanks nbc for giving us the finally we didn't get!
