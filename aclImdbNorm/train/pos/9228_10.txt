expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges, flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipated.<br /><br />it actually has a feminist storyline, though i don't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set. it certainly wasn't practiced. women (and the jews and the poor) are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society. throughout the story, sister flavia (florinda bolkan) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can't sit there any longer and actually does something about it, albeit with disastrous results.<br /><br />the pre-credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield. she sees an injured "evil" muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to assist him. before she can, her hate-filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face (great family dynamics, huh?). after this, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. though scenes do involve violence, rape and nuns, i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation. <br /><br />indeed, many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there, but the acting, camera-work, storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level. most "nun" films i've seen usually have the basic premise of: a good girl somehow winds up in a convent, where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and/or make their lives a living hell.<br /><br />flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her. much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong-spirited (but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside like me, but it's a lot easier for guys) sister agatha. when a group of muslims attack their abbey, flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns. their attackers actually function as their liberators (of the cruelty and near-slavery of the abbey). in fact, it is a christian, not a muslim invader, that impales dear sister agatha. <br /><br />it is agatha's death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her... her father treats her like dirt. her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time. i don't want to give out too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened at the conclusion. this is a great film, so don't be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as a trash epic. plus, how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong? i am not familiar with mar'ia casares' other works, but sister agatha is a hell of a character.<br /><br />i have read many great reviews of the synapse (us) release, but i love my german x-rated kult dvd copy. it isn't anamorphic/16:9, but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapse's release.<br /><br />and there are also many great, wise or funny lines of dialogue (many from sister agatha)<br /><br />"why is god male? the father, the son, and the holy spirit
