this is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern england. filmed on location in bolton, it stars james mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home. or so it seems. cleverly, the film, based on the play, portrays the complexities of family life. the supporting cast is terrific as well, with many familiar faces lending support.
