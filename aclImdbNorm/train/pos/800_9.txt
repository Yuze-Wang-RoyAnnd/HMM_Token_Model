i couldn't have been more thrilled; just eight years old back in 1983, i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater! the best day of my life was about to happen. to that time, my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars. i hadn't even seen the empire strikes back yet.<br /><br />and boy, did that day deliver for my less critical eyes. jabba. big rebel spaceships. the emporer. a green-bladed lightsaber!! wow! since that magical day, i must have watched this movie hundreds of times. i can't even form an accurate estimate at this point. with those multiple viewings, i have of course observed that this movie - the real episode iii - does have its flaws.<br /><br />of course in the context of a star wars movie, those "flaws" are more like "quirks".<br /><br />millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. in may of 1983, i had mine. and this was my star wars movie.
