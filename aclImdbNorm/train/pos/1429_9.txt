i loved the way earth is made. its photography is unbelievable, editing it must have been an interesting challenge and patrick stewart's voice over is perfect. in addition its music and sound editing make watching earth a profound experience you don't want to miss. you really are on a journey to where you would probably never-ever end up by yourself. <br /><br />and although, at first, i was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see animals in their daily fight for survival, i could not help laughing myself sometimes. nature simply seems too impressive to comprehend.<br /><br />but, rather than the need to laugh, i left the cinema with a profound question:"howcome 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?"<br /><br />with this question in mind, you'll understand how i felt somewhat bitter and powerless after seeing earth. i felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once (all that not being a ngo activist at all!)...<br /><br />so i immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what i could do to save our -still- fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing fate... (www.loveearth.com)<br /><br />i was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there. yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went through.<br /><br />i hope that cutting on my energy-use will do. i don't know how else to shorten the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted state...<br /><br />an inspiring film it is, but i didn't leave the cinema feeling very happy.
