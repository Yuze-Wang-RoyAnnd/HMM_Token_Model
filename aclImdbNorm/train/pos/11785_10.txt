i don't quite know how to explain "darkend room," because to summarize it wouldn't really do it justice. it's a quintessentially lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. i would say this short is definitely more on the "mulholland drive" end of the lynchian spectrum, as opposed to "the elephant man" or "the straight story." it's hidden on lynch's website, and well worth the search.
