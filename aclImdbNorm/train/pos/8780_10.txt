this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood. what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history. what makes the story of james j. corbett especially interesting is that mr. corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. in that respect james j. corbett was truly innovated. but getting back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. alexis smith was beautiful. indeed, she looked like nicole kidman. and although it's a period piece, the story withstands the test of time; it has not gone stale. ward bond's portrayal of john l. sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic, well-staged and highly effective. that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must.
