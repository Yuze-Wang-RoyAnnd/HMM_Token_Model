"scoop" is easily woody allen's funniest film of the 2000's so far. allen, although finally looking his age, is at the top of his game as low-brow magician sidney waterman. his one-liners and demeanor are hilarious. don't let the critics sway your opinion. "scoop" is a top notch "woody-lite" picture. <br /><br />the classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen. scarlett johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit. jackman is dashing. the cinematography glows. "scoop" is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish. the last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price.
