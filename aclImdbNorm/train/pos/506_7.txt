a strong pilot, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for "enterprise," the "prequel" to the original "star trek" series. it stumbles a few times into "trek" convention and clich'e--candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style, and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as "seven of vulcan"--but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are well-drawn, and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful, in different ways, than those of earlier (later?) series. scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger, and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players. the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in "star trek: the next generation," "deep space 9" and "voyager": instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift, it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later--which i hope happens, because after about a half-dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.
