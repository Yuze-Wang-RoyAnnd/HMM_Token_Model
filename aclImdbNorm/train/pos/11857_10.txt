a lot of people are saying that al pacino over acted but i mean common obviously for a movie role like this -- a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent. this movie overall was a really good movie i myself rated a 10/10 i would highly recommend people to watch this movie.
