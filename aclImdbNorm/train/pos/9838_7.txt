born again is a okay episode of season 1. the reincarnation bit, in my opinion, is cool. the more i watch it, the more i like it, yet it will never rise above 'very good' for me. even though it is not very memorable, i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode. anyway, now i will say what is good and bad about this episode,<br /><br />the good: oragami. oh yeah!<br /><br />that fish tank was nice. =]<br /><br />thrown out of a window. very classy. x]<br /><br />the bad: marry your best friend's wife!? o_o<br /><br />what a random pick to reincarnate.<br /><br />why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up, try to take his scarf off instead?<br /><br />conclusion: okay episode, not very memorable. 7/10
