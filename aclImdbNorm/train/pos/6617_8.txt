animation always seems to be fringe. in japan, this might not be the case, but in europe and much more so in the usa animation has a big fat "kids" tag on it. france is probably one of the more comic-liberal countries, home of classics as tin-tin, asterix, lucky luke, valereon and so on(if you've never read these, it's not too late. there's no upper-age limit on them and they don't carry the nerd-stigma of dc or marvel) it seems natural a movie like this one pops up in france. it suits my prejudiced image of the french as art-loving, anti-usa-oriented and talented movie-makers. luckily there's also "a scanner darkly" out there to suppress that view - seems art is pretty much international.<br /><br />anyway, as you might have gathered renaissance is artsy and french. if you're a normal person you will get scared by this. there's no need for that however! beneath it's cool, sleek cel-shaded appearance there's a good thriller and a good movie overall.<br /><br />that was one of my fears for this movie. it's so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick, much like sony & c:o are doing with their pixar rip-offs. i was expecting a confusing, sometimes boring and not very engaging movie, but luckily i was wrong.<br /><br />i would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir stuff, but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well. note: i've seen the french dub which was ok as far as i could see. english might be more interesting what with craig and everything.<br /><br />a final word of praise to the animation. it was awesome. futuristic, well-crafted, nice camera-work, smart solutions(eyes for example looked very good, which is hard to do) and so visually stunning i felt like bursting out "this is so damn impressive!". then again, i really like animation and i appreciate the effort the studio put down, so my verdict is a bit biased.<br /><br />good movie anyway, definitely lives beyond it's "gimmick".
