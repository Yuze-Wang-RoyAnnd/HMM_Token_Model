"how to lose friends & alienate people" is not based on tiger woods' infidelities. it is a mediocre romantic comedy based on toby young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities. the film stars simon pegg as sidney young, a zany british journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in new york. young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him, hence movie title. he is uproarious, daring, and moronic. but nevertheless for some very bizarre reason, he is a somewhat likable character. sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the composed alison olsen, played quite admirably by kirsten dunst. however, sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress sophie maes played by the fantastic ms. megan fox. this foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on "eye candy" material. sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co. those are the peak comedic moments of the film. however, i think that director robert weide and screenwriter peter straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between sidney & alison; even though team weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise. pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as sidney young. jeff bridges was again building "the dude" bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as clayton harding, the magazine's suave prez. but the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here. "how to lose friends & alienate people" should not be alienated entirely, but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** average
