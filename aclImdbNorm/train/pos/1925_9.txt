this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment. it takes the sugary-sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats, brat brothers, over-protective fathers and bimbo sisters. i'm almost surprised it's disney!<br /><br />to its credit, '8 simple rules' knows it's a comedy and doesn't try to be more. too many shows (eg, 'sister, sister' and 'lizzie mcguire') think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard-hitting. this is a trap '8 simple rules' has avoided; it does tackle some issues (such as being the school outcast) but it has fun while doing so. in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his character.<br /><br />and i think, although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark, '8 simple rules' can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesn't make cate's father a second version of paul hennessy.
