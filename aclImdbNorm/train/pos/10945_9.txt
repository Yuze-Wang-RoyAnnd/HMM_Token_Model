best show since seinfeld. she's really really funny. her total self centeredness, the hulking gay stoner neighbors, the departures into song or cartoons, make this the freshest show on tv. one of the few shows i make point of watching. the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore ("oh wait now that you're close you do look old" turns face with finger and walks away lol), the cough syrup overdose, sleeping with god, it's all so funny or so stupid it's just a lot of fun. the shows weak points are her sister and the cop-only because they're too darn normal!! i really can't wait until the next show, something i haven't felt for any show in a long time.
