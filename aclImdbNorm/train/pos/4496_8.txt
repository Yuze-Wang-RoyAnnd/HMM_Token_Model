to put it simply, i enjoyed this film. the reason for my interest & enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject matter itself. i had heard tales from my mother and grandmother about how northern england working class life and attitudes used to be (as experienced by them)and this is an interesting depiction that seems to faithfully represent what they told me. in particular, the paternalistic but overbearing father who "knows" what is best for his family along with his stubborness when this paradigm is challenged. (not much has changed there then!!)<br /><br />people who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the film because the story does not easily transfer across the different media. in a sense however, the film is an historical document and i personally enjoyed it, if only because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon.
