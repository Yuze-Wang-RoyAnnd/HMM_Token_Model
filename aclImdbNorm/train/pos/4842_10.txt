if the very thought of arthur askey twists your guts, don't worry, you can still watch and love the ghost train, like the equally marvellous back room boy, it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance, even that of the lead actor. personally, i love askey, perhaps it's because i go into his world, rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine, which is a mistake too many people make. the ghost train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn't conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep, dark world it transports you to, it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it's a film that i would imagine few people have ever watched just the once. the cast are, without exception, extraordinarily good, perhaps linden travers lays it on a bit thick, but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime, she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out. the sad passing of the lovely carole lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past, but waiting patiently for us to press play.
