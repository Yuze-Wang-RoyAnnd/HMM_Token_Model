i recently started watching this show, and i have to say that it really made me laugh. you have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it, along with everything else. some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead, among other things. if you are going accept that ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that the other completely crazy bits of the show. i couldn't help smiling after every episode i watched. i really think it's great there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it great to watch. i absolutely love the narration, i think it adds that extra bit of wonder to the whole show. you can't always compare old shows by a writer to his new ones, you have to take everything as it's own entity. definitely give it a chance, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
