this movie is one i strongly recommend. it's about a boy, stanley yelnats (shia lebeouf) who is wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to camp green lake, a boys' detention center. there, he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diamiter. while there, he meets the other boys of the camp (zero, magnet, armpit, squid, x-ray, and zigzag). all of them are digging, not to 'build charactor', but to find outlaw kate barlow's treasure. throughout the movie (and book) stanley learns more about the past, more about himself, and more about digging holes. i give this movie a 9.5, because, i am very picky when it comes to books to movies, (i want the movie to follow the book exactly). but, still it did real well.
