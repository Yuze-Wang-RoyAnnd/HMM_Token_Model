another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batman:dead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more! this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts. the attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. although this is a limited resources production, it puts to shame big budgeted, star-casted, hyped productions "other" superhero related movies. here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people. finally, a superman that actually looks "super" and looks like the real thing! batman the way it should be, without the flashy rubber-casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver. i just wish that some sensible warner bros. exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel. i don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd, i would never get tired of watching it. just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this. hope the "bigwigs" at marvel & dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look. no more "batman & robin" fiasco, or hulk, daredevil, etc. learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to "reinvent" the hero for the movie, just to have it "bomb" in theaters. mr. collora...we need more directors like you!!
