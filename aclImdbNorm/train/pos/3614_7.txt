girlfight is like your grandmother's cooking: same old recipe you've tried a million times before, yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new. try and explain the story to people who haven't seen it before: a young women from the wrong side of the tracks attempts to improve her situation by taking up boxing whilst dealing with a bitter, obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival. watch them roll their eyes at the string of clich'es, and they're right: it *is* clich'ed. yet i was hypnotized by how well this film works, due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue, and sensitive direction that makes it 'new'. i avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap but don't make the same mistake i did. definiately worth a look.
