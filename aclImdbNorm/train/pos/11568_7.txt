one of the many merrie melodies cartoons that entertained american moviegoers during wwii, bob clampett's "an itch in time" portrays a hobo flea settling on elmer fudd's dog. the little guy turns into a real sadist while making a home on the dog's back, but elmer warns the dog: "one more scwatch and i'll give you a bath!" meanwhile, the flea is setting up dynamite on the dog!* and that's not the end! i noticed that in one scene, elmer is reading a comic book featuring bugs bunny and porky pig. obviously, elmer and bugs frequently co-starred but elmer never co-starred with porky (unless you count the very short "any bonds today?"). but to me, the thought of elmer reading about these other famous characters from his same genre stresses the metaphysical nature of his world, as though he knew of their existence within his universe even though they don't appear in this cartoon.<br /><br />of course, i'm probably going too far in my analysis. i'm sure that the cartoon was intended as pure entertainment, and it certainly entertains. as for the "i might get to like this" line, it sounds as though that was something that the censors wouldn't have allowed but somehow missed; i, for one, don't actually know what it was supposed to sound like. was it something sexual? as for the end, had i thought that i'd seen everything, i would have been tempted to look for more, rather than do what the cat did (although it was a neat trick).<br /><br />*the guys behind these cartoons sure had a thing for tnt, didn't they?
