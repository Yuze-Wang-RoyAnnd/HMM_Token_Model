enjoyable movie although i think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it. it is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why elly is such a recluse. then, when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isn't much detail. perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something.<br /><br />anyway, it is still a good movie that i'd watch again. 7/10<br /><br />
