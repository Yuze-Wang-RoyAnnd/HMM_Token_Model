the league of gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time. so much so, it paved the way for more comedies of its ilk, many of which have copied the style, but have never succeeded.<br /><br />unlike every other sketch show around, the characters of the league of gentlemen are all loosely connected. firstly they all live in the fictional town of royston vasey, in the back of beyond of northern england. <br /><br />the first characters to greet newcomers are tubbs and edwrad, the pig-faced owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably don't know of its existence. other oddities include: the denton family, with an obsession with hygiene, chastity and toads; hillary briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat; pauline, a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens; mr. chinnery, kind-hearted vet and menace to all things four-legged; geoff tipps, a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour, often involving guns, electric tubes and . . . . . . . plums!!!!! <br /><br />despite being a comedy at heart, the league of gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other people's material. there are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker, a pair of silent twins, an obsessive circus owner, and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds. even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and aforementioned characters such as pauline and geoff are shown in a more sympathetic, vulnerable light. the film adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide they belong local.<br /><br />the equally underrated third series also takes a different route, instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van. although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two, they're certainly signs to how inventive the league of gentlemen can be, and how unafraid to explore new areas.<br /><br />in short, the league of gentlemen is definitely worth a look, as like the welcome signs says: you'll never leave!
