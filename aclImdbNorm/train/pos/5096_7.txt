this is a sprawling (4 hours) remake of the rider haggard story, with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with russian soldiers seeking a "stone of power" buried along with the treasure of king solomon. it's very well shot, giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of africa, and very well acted. patrick swayze is an excellent alan quatermain, and allison doody is attractive as elizabeth maitland, who hires quatermain to help rescue her father. sidede onyulo as umbopa, gavin hood as mcnabb and the leader of the russian soldiers (not named in imdb's listing) are also memorable. for all that hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adapt it, this one is well told and, except that it's too long, i enjoyed it. 6/10.
