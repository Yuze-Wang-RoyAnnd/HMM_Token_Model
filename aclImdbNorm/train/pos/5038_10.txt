what a real treat and quite unexpected. this is what a real thriller movie is all about. i rushed into the video shop, grabbed a movie without reading the entire blurb on the back and hoped for the best. i was totally surprised and delighted. i really enjoyed the actors and their characters. i thought they all gave a great performance and made their characters realistic. the plot was well thought out,well written and directed. it kept you interested from start to finish and never got boring for a single minute.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie for those that like thrillers, especially thrillers that are well paced and ones that keep your attention. definitely a 10 out of 10 from me.
