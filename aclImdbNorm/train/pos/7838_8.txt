if you're a t-rex/marc bolan fan, i recommend you check this out. it shows a whimsical side of marc bolan as well as ringo starr, apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren't part of the concert, but fun to watch, leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people, and when the concert is shown a talented musician, both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls. watching him in concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends, like elton john and ringo starr appearing in some of the live performances. true, there are a few songs missing that i would like to have seen on there, but like any album it can't have everything. i just bought this in 2006, but if i would have know it came out in 1972, i would have definitely bought it years ago. sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars, would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash!
