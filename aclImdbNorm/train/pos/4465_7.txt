anchors aweigh is an entertaining mgm musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but i wouldn't rate it up there with classics like singin in the rain or the band wagon. this was the first of three musicals that gene kelly and frank sinatra appeared in together. kelly and sinatra play joe brady and clarence doolittle, two sailors on leave in hollywood who befriend a young boy (dean stockwell)who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (kathryn grayson) a struggling actress who is working as an extra at mgm. though both guys are initially attracted to grayson, she eventually voices a preference to joe but clarence later hooks up with a waitress (pamela britton)who, he learns is from his hometown of brooklyn. the paper-thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including "we hate to leave", joe and clarence's lament to their fellow sailors as they're leaving the ship; grayson's torrid rendition of "jalousie"; sinatra's dreamy rendition of "i fall in love too easily" (a number which is sadly deleted from some prints of this film), and "the worry song", a fantasy dance that kelly does with animated jerry the mouse from tom and jerry fame. kelly also does a sort of kissing bandit fantasy ballet which rivals his pirate's ballet in the later the pirate. kelly is in peak form here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only oscar nomination for best actor and sinatra's endearingly shy character here is undeniably sexy. an entertaining diversion for fans of the mgm musical factory.
