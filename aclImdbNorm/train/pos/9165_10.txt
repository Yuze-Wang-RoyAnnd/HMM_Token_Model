this has to be the best adaptation i have seen it's my favourite and i think it stays very close to the book.what really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors.the wonderful timothy dalton is the best rochester i have seen on screen brooding and tragic,while zelah clarke is the perfect combination of strength,courage,shyness and gentleness as jane. the story(as i'm sure most people know)is this,the young and plain jane eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800's who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers.she is offered the post of governess at the big mansion thornfield hall to tutor adele the young ward of the halls mysterious and respected owner mr rochester. as the months go on he falls in love with jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if jane is as madly in love with him as he is with her.however there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at thornfield hall and when it is it's effects are devastating.this is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as i said earlier excellent acting especially from zelah and timothy.
