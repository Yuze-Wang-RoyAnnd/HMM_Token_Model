disney have done it again. brilliant the way timone and pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help simba when he needed them. i love this film and watch it over and over again. it shows how timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before setting off to find his dream home and adventure. then he meets pumbaa and things do change. together, they search for the home timon wants and repeatedly fail, which is funny as timone gets more and more crazy. then simba turns up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous 2 films. the rest, you already know.
