this is a fan-made short film that pretends to be a preview for a new movie that pairs batman and superman! it's the sort of film that fans adore and watch at places like comiccon and was made by the same person who made batman: dead end, sandy collora.<br /><br />as far as this film goes, i could easily pick it apart. sure the cgi effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. but, this was made on a shoestring budget and for a fan film this is incredible. i was particularly impressed by the very buff superman--he was no wimpy little guy! if only this were a preview for a real film--they'd have fans lined up from here to omaha to see it. great job.
