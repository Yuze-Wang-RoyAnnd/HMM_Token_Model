this is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad, unfortunate death at the box office. i saw this film at a local art cinema,in revival form,shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas. it certainly deserves to be approached a second time (or even a third). sandra b. takes it to the limit by doing spoken word & taking on some well known songs in this piece (her version of hank william's 'i'm so lonesome i could cry' could easily move you to tears). maybe someday, audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously (but not without some well placed laughs,too). the film moves at a brisk pace (thanks to some nice editing),so that some viewers will not find it stale & boring. perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline.
