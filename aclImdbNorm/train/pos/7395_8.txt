almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in china. there are no fancy sets, explosion or glamorous people--only fine writing, acting and direction (hollywood, take note!).<br /><br />an estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying. he is surprised to see that dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual. in fact, he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop! dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and doesn't really see the value of the old bathhouse. how their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable.<br /><br />i was happy to see that not every chinese movie is an action picture (such as those starring jet li or crouching tiger, hidden dragon), as i don't particularly care for these frenetic films. the shower as well as springtime in a small town are two wonderful examples of good chinese films about people!
