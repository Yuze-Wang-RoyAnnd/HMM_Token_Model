sergio martino has impressed me recently with his giallo classics 'the strange vice of mrs wardh' and the unforgettably titled, 'your vice is a locked room and only i have the key' - but even so, i wasn't expecting too much from this film. the case of the scorpion's tail doesn't get mentioned as much as the aforementioned titles when it comes to classic giallo discussion - but i don't know why, because this is at least as good as those two! dario argento may be the 'king' of giallo, but with the five films that he made - sergio martino surely isn't too far behind. in some ways, he even surpasses the master. all of martino's films were released prior to the jewel in argento's crown, the magnificent profondo rosso, so back in the early seventies - martino was the king! the plot here follows the idea of murder for profit, and follows the insurance payout of a wealthy man. his wife inherits $1 million, and it isn't long before there's people out for her blood! when she turns up dead shortly thereafter, an insurance investigator and a plucky, attractive young journalist follow up the case.<br /><br />the case of the scorpion's tail may not benefit from the beautiful edwige fenech, but it does have two of martino's collaborators on board. most famous is george hilton, who worked with marino on the strange vice of mrs wardh and all the colors of the dark, along with a number of other giallos. hilton has a great screen presence, and every time i see him in an italian thriller; it becomes obvious why he is repeatedly cast. the beautiful anita strindberg, who will be remembered from your vice is a locked room, stars alongside hilton and excellently provides the classic giallo female lead. sergio martino does a good job in the director's chair once again, with several beautiful scenes - the best of which taking place in a room bathed with green lighting! the score by bruno nicolai (wardh) excellently sets the mood, but it is the script that, once again, is the driving force behind martino's success. ernesto gastaldi, the writer for martino's other four giallo, has put together a script that is thrilling while staying away from the common giallo pitfall of not making sense; thus liberating this film from the rest of the illogical genre. the case of the scorpion's tail is a quality giallo film, and yet another success for the great sergio martino. if you like giallo, you'll love this!
