i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it. it actually exceeded my expectations. considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways, especially given the plot. just like the blair witch project, this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film. another bonus: whereas most low-budget horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre-to-unintentionally hysterical acting, this film actually had a talented cast (save one or two characters), particularly the two leads. the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline. it borrows heavily from better-known films like "deliverance" and "wrong turn" but if you're like me, films of this nature never cease to be terrifying. plus, the director keeps things interesting throughout. i'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out...
