creature comforts in america should have been released on a different network, or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes. unfortunately, this was not the case. given that american audiences (seemingly) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes, or has a preoccupation with scatological functions (both sound and smells), shows like this will be few and far between. one of the main problems was that however brilliant it was, it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching. which is sad, but not unexpected. i would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct dvd release. the material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface. but thanks to political correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
