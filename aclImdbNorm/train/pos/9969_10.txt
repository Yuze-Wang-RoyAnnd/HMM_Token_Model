shawshank, godfather, pulp fiction... all good films. great films. but nothing, and i mean nothing lives up to the greatest christmas movie of all, santa claus.<br /><br />the film is so great and has so many messages, i cried while watching it. seriously, this is one of those movies you need to watch 10 times. when we see pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel the deep sorrow, and then we wonder... what is so bad about this ice cream? is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil? think movie makes you think.<br /><br />this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever. unlike other santas, he is a normal person. we see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams, and we wonder; is the santa we believe in really that good? also, this santa actually mentions christ, the whole meaning behind christmas.<br /><br />you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece. we should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic 24/7. whether it's christmas or not, this movie gets a 500/10. whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool.
