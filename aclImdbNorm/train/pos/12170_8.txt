romantic comedies can really go either way, you know? you'll see one that's really sappy, and you'll think you want something more realistic. then, you'll see one that's realistic, but it might be too dull to keep you interested. or maybe you'll see one that does everything right, but just fails to make you smile. romantic comedies are tough movies. you go into them with a lot of expectations, and usually, whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you.<br /><br />of course, if you've got a girl next to you, and you're a guy like me, it probably doesn't matter all that much whether the movie's any good, you've got other things on your mind. for you, i say, "go get her, tiger!" for the rest of us, i say, "see _a guy thing_." it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />because _a guy thing_ knows you're going in to this movie with expectations, so it doesn't pretend that its "guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams, and it's not his wife!" plot is going to make everyone happy. sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't ring true, or you think it's cruel. _a guy thing_ covers that. what _a guy thing_ does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i've seen in a long time, so if you don't the main plotline, you've still got something to make you smile.<br /><br />whether we're talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen, like larry miller (pretty woman, best in show), james brolin (traffic), julie hagerty (airplane!), david koechner (saturday night live and conan o'brien regular, dirty work, austin powers ii) or thomas lennon (the state and viva variety), or new faces like shawn hatosy (the faculty), or colin foo (saving silverman), we're talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired characterisation, steal the show, time after time, and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days.<br /><br />and that's not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along, because it's very sweet and terribly well done. jason lee (mallrats, chasing amy, dogma, etc.) is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control, and selma blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is.<br /><br />a lot of the success of the movie, though, falls on julia stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and she wears it well. not since, gosh, i don't know when, have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy. of course, it's all in the closeups, the voice, and the subtle smiles, but it's magical, and it's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place.<br /><br />but julie stiles's slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-on in their classic simplicity. this is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types, makes them fall over each other to make you laugh, and then comes through with a great deal of heart.<br /><br />a guy thing is a movie you've definitely seen before, and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it. we haven't really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare; the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl. a guy thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge, often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play.<br /><br />for the record, it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy, so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it.<br /><br />and guys, i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lee's friends in this movie. i'm not going to spoil it for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema, i suggest you just say "it's a guy thing," and leave it at that.
