since this movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well-off, it was just scary as to how real it really was! the acting is what gave the movie that push to greatness.<br /><br />diane keaton portrayed the main character, patsy mccartle who had two sons whom she adored. her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen. it was very hard to watch some of the scenes since they were so real as to what happens when one becomes addicted to drugs.<br /><br />just watching this very loving mother go from sweet to not caring at all was hard, but so true. i have known people who have gone through withdrawl and it was very much like what happened in this movie, from what i remember.<br /><br />i also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. yet it was done so well. i applaud the director for making this movie.<br /><br />i highly recommend this to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or to just learn what can happen to you if you do become addicted to them.
