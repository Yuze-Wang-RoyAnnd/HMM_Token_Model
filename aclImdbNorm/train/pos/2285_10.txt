i haven't read this book, but all through the movie i was awestruck with only one thought in my head: this is so vonnegut. i have never seen an author, all of the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel, translated so well to film. this movie had the same complexities found in vonnegut's novels: the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and the dramatic events and symbols were often also jokes.<br /><br />campbell was also a very vonnegut character, portrayed perfectly by nick nolte. he had all of the earmarks of a vonnegut "hero": lack of concern for political boundaries, ironic dark humor giving way to dumb inactivity in response to stress, and an unwillingness to push his version of reality on those around him.<br /><br />overall, i was constantly surprised and impressed as i watched this movie. it was the same feeling i had reading "cat's cradle," my first vonnegut novel, as if the most perfectly oddball thing that could happen, he thought of that, and he made it real and important. yes, he has nothing but army surplus "white christmas" albums. so it goes!
