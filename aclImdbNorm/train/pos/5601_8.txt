one thing i'm sure everyone who has seen this film will agree on is that it is very creepy. the other films in polanski's unofficial trilogy are creepy too, but they are all different in what makes them creepy, but they all roughly deal with the same thing, they all deal with the mind. definitely the staring people are very creepy, each of them sent shivers down my spine that made me incapable of sitting still. again, if you have seen the other two films mentioned, i'm sure you'll find this quite creepy, because you begin to expect typical polanski traits that you think you have caught onto, he is aware of this and will keep teasing you with simple things, personally every time trelkovsky would slowly turn around i would be bracing myself for a jump, maybe that's just me, but it felt intended to do that, though it was quite subtle, there is no build up of the music in those moments.<br /><br />the acting in this was pretty good, mostly that from polanski of course, the other characters in the film don't have all that much time to outshine the lead. polanski really proves himself as an all-round great filmmaker, he not only can direct and write great films, but he can actually act too. i don't think there is any other better person who could have pulled off the trelkovsky character, polanski settled right on in perfectly. i like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast, to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent, which i respect greatly.<br /><br />one thing i didn't like about this film is how it was done in english. for those who don't know, this is a french film, american financed, and as well to make it more commercially successful it was mostly done in english. there are parts which it is very obvious there has been dubbing, and i don't know why it is, but 3/4 of the time when there is a dub they get the complete wrong person to do the dub. there is a women in the film who when she speaks it's obvious it's a dub, but they got the most annoying person to do the voice-over, it was seriously pain to my ears to hear her speak, she had the loudest high pitch voice i've heard in a while, it almost seemed fake, but i don't see what the point was, she was a rather small character. i honestly would of preferred if they just left it as it was filmed, parts of it in french and parts of it in english, because the dubbing in this film was a pain and was not near (two completely different films, i know) the high standard of another film that did a similar thing, which was, the good, the bad and the ugly. i realise it's not a big problem, just when you do realise it, it gets annoying, but i'm sure you won't sit there the long trying to lip read what they are actually saying, regardless if you know french.<br /><br />whats so great about polanski is that he will let you think you know him, that you know his style, which in some aspects you do, but really, you can't see whats behind that corner. this film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned, which i think really strengthens this one in particular. i personally feel this is the best of the three, i'm unsure which comes next, but they are all relatively close in their level of greatness. the ending is fantastic, it is so easy to dwindle on it for a long time to come and get nowhere. i choose not to think to much on it, just to have my personal opinion and leave it at that.<br /><br />i've rambled on, and i haven't really given any insight on what makes this film so great, i don't think, so i'll quickly do it here. if you liked repulsion and/or rosemary's baby, i guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least. for those who are too unfortunate to have seen either then i recommend you check this film out if your looking for something that is quite a creepy film that is quite intelligent, particularly the end, as well if your looking for something that deals with the mind, paranoia even, though that is better fitted under repulsion.
