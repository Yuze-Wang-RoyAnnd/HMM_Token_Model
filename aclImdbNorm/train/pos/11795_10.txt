i will never forget this film or the events that lead up to jonestown in guyana. it just seems so tragic but needs to be told. powers boothe give a commanding performance as the leader rev. jim jones from obscurity until total madness. it would have won him an academy award easily if it was released in the movie theaters. it is the kind of mini-series you won't forget. you won't forget the images of the cult's brutality, control, and obsessiveness of it's leader. his rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise. the mass suicide is horrifying, almost unreal to anybody's imagination as to why so many people (900+) went willingly or resisted jones' orders. they don't make mini series like these anymore where we're left with out mouths open and hungry to know what happened to the others.
