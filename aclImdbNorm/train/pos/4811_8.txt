who knew? dowdy queen victoria, the plump monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband, prince albert, actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days. 'the young victoria' not only chronicles the young queen's romance with her husband-to-be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne.<br /><br />the act i 'set-up' draws you in right away. following the death of victoria's father, the duke of kent in 1820, less than a year after victoria's birth, the duchess of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john conroy, who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queen-to-be. conroy insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious 'kensington system', rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up. what's more, victoria was forced to sleep in her mother's bedroom everyday until she became queen.<br /><br />the film explains that in 1830 parliament passed the regency act, which established that victoria's mother would become regent (and hence guardian) in the event that victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor. during this time, the duchess and conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making conroy her private secretary and treasurer. strong-willed victoria would have none of it, and refused to go along with conroy's and her mother's nefarious plans. the duchess disliked king william as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the monarchy; the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife. as a result, the duchess attempted to limit victoria's contact with the king. in an over-the-top scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history, the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet, stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regent.<br /><br />king william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne. victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy, whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable. they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her mother.<br /><br />'the young victoria' conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victoria's coronation as queen. a good part of the film deals with victoria's relationship with lord melbourne, the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was. in the beginning melbourne gains the young queen's trust and they become good friends. in the early years of her reign, she sees melbourne as a progressive, but later loses respect for him somewhat as he's revealed to be a typical politician, hiding his contempt for the masses whom he's supposed to be championing. in reality, melbourne was more a father figure to victoria, but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert, as though they were romantic rivals.<br /><br />the plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel, of the more conservative tory party, as the new prime minister. the film chronicles the events of 'the bedchamber crisis' in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians. the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings, one of the duchess's ladies-in-waiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him. because of her hatred for conroy, victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings' alleged pregnancy. as it turned out, hastings only appeared pregnant
