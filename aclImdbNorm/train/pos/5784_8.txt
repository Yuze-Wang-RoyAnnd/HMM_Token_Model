i've noticed that a lot of people who post on the "kerching!" board seem to hate this show, which i actually find very surprising. i think it's one of the best british kids' shows there is. it's a shame it's ending because it's very funny (if a bit cheesy sometimes) and has great characters. the main character is a little like del boy, although quite a lot smarter. with his 2 best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mum by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of "rudeboy". his friends are seymour (who likes to cook) and danny (who is simple minded and the comic relief character). throughout the show, some characters have left and new ones have come in, but it's always been entertaining and improving.
