i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver & the muppets a christmas together.this made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy. i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd. the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show. i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show. the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading, the sound is not as good as the cd. there is also a few other songs not put on the cd. as a fan of john denver and of the muppets, a dvd of this show would really be a good seller. if you don't have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show. the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on.
