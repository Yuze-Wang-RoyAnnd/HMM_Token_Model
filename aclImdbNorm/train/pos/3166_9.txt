this show has come so far. at first everyone in the cast from eric to fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look what they accomplished. they stuck with the show and it was a success. its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom i've ever seen in my life. it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show, i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had. i don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. go down swinging, get one last punch in. the show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know its going to end, like on friends, and let the finale be huge. i say get donna and eric married, i say have hyde and kelso fight and become friends again, i say have something interesting happen between fez and jackie because fez has been trying for so long, but of course it wont work out for him. just close out the series big time guys!<br /><br />that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes. eric, kelso, donna, jackie, fez, hyde, i wish i had you guys as friends. you are the best!<br /><br />10/10...
