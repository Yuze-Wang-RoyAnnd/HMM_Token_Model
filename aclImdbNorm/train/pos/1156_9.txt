years ago i did follow a soap on tv. so i was curious about this movie, and i was so rewarded for finding it. it's a marvelous spoof of soaps, with jealousies, the usual actors' insecurities, and all sorts of lovely excesses. but more than anything - an amazing cast and an incredible script. how did someone get all those top-notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie? and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines? i never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it, but it's marvelous and i highly recommend seeing it. sometimes i'll throw it on while doing housecleaning, and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing. many congrats to all who made it.
