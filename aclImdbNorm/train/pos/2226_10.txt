i am surprised at imdb's low rating of this movie. with all due respect, its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor. they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget, and more gore.<br /><br />the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film. it is not, nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one. it is a psychological thriller. it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. reel.com's review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie. all the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense. it's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days- is something bad and not worth it.<br /><br />i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense. martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning. the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing.<br /><br />i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6's range on originality alone. i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale- aka smart people- since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy's nightmare.<br /><br />kudos to the acting as well. for such a low budget film, you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction, writing, and acting. please don't be fooled by the rating by imdb. this movie is worth it. i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice.
