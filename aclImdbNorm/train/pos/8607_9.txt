have never understood why the macdonald-eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly--not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone. to me, "i married an angel" is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings. the sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an mgm musical, the script is by the reliable anita loos ("san francisco," "the women," "gentlemen prefer blondes," etc.), the rodgers and hart tunes (albeit altered a bit by macdonald-eddy regulars bob wright and chet forrest) are given celestial treatment by herbert stothart (oscar-winner for scoring "the wizard of oz"), and best of all, the "singing sweethearts" look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings. try to show "rose marie" or "sweethearts" to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still, but this offbeat, fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain.
