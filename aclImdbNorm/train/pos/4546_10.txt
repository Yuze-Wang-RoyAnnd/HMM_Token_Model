this movie will go down down in history as one of the greats, right along side of citizen kane, casablanca, and on the waterfront. someone please convince leno to do a sequel! leno and morita are a comedy duo, the likes of which haven't been seen since abbot and costello. the evil that emanates from chris sarandon, tom noonan, and randall "tex" cobb will give you the chills. dingman's character as the buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of shakespeare's comedies. and the climax. my goodness, the climax. i won't ruin it for you, but it makes the explosion of the death star pale in comparison. if you can track down this hard-to-find gem, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately. i'm still holding out hope for a special edition dvd one of these days.
