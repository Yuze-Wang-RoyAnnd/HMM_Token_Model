especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed (1973), this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong. too many people, and nothing works. the only people who can live in comfort are the rich. it's set in new york in 2022 (i think), and it reminds you of your worst vision of calcutta.<br /><br />i got to appreciate charlton heston's acting after seeing him in orson welles' touch of evil. he was (maybe is) capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi-heroic people. here, he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt (taking rare food treats from the rich), and being totally corrupt (actively condoning evil). <br /><br />the movie all seems to take place at night, and sweat is dripping off everyone, except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. even though i hadn't seen it before, i knew the famous ending (which will not here be revealed), but the ending is certainly foreshadowed.<br /><br />great scenes with edward g. robinson: going to the council (made up of elderly jews with heavy accents, so it seems), where the truth is revealed. and then going off to the thanatopsis to check out.<br /><br />gritty, pre-star wars dystopian science fiction.
