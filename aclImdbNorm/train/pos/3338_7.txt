fever pitch is a fun enough movie. it has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle where all the heavy, "she's breaking up with me" stuff happens, but other than that it continues to be funny until the end.<br /><br />even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the red sox, it's not overloaded with sports. you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this film.<br /><br />of course that's easy for me to say: i've been a red sox fan since i was a boy, too.<br /><br />7 out of 10.<br /><br />barky
