another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the rosenstrasse protest in berlin, an event i had not known of, that began in late february, 1943. the details are given in an addendum that follows this review.<br /><br />the film narrative sets the story of this protest within another, contemporary story that begins in new york city, in the present. here a well off, non-observant jewish woman, whose husband has just died, shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual. she goes even further, demanding that her daughter's non-jewish fianc'e leave the house.<br /><br />the distressed daughter, hannah (maria schrader) then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii, in berlin, her mother, then 8 years old, had been taken in and protected by an aryan woman. hannah drops everything, goes to berlin, and finds this woman, lena fischer, now 90. hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. it all seems rather too pat.<br /><br />the film thereafter improves, focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest, in which the fictitious central character is the same mrs. fischer at 33 (played magnificently by katja riemann), a baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to fabian (martin feifel), a jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained at the rosenstrasse site.<br /><br />the narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again. while scenes in the present are color saturated, the 1943 scenes are washed out, strong on blue-gray tones.<br /><br />the quality of acting is generally quite good, what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in germany and the direction of margarethe von trotta, new german cinema's most prominent female filmmaker, herself a former actress.<br /><br />the story of the protest is told simply. only one feature is lacking that would have helped: still-text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse, an outcome that was, as the addendum below makes clear, incredibly positive.<br /><br />"rosenstrasse" has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics. overly long, needlessly layered, purveyor of gender stereotypes, manipulative with music: so go the usual raps. it is too long. but i found in this film an austere, powerful, spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were detained. i found nothing flashy, contemporary or manipulative in this depiction.<br /><br />the very absence of extreme violence (no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized) intensified my tension, which increased incrementally as the film progressed. you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute. the somberness of the film stayed with me afterward. i awoke often later in the night i saw the film, my mind filled with bleak, melancholic, chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film. for me, that happens rarely. (in german and english). my rating: 8/10 (b+).
