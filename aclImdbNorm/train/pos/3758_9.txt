this movie is awesome. if you take it too seriously, of course you will hate it; however, it's quantity of "dudes" and "right ons" brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago. i like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness, and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor, "bill and ted's excellent adventure" (1989). if you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes, and totally mature humor, don't watch it; however, if you want a film that is humorous and silly, yet intelligent and engaging, you will enjoy it. i actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in today's theatres. and hey, it's keanu reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as acting...right...doesn't get much better than that :)
