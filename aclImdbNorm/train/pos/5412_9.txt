as a pok'emon fan i enjoyed this movie very much. it introduces new legendary pok'emon (as each movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. i however do not expect those who are not pok'emon fans to enjoy it(this includes most adults). some of the lines were corny, but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to english. the animation was beautiful, although there were a couple parts that did not look good. and although the villain is kind of corny, i think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains, and i guarantee you that they aren't all like this one. those who did not like it, i say to each his own, but pok'emon fans will love it.
