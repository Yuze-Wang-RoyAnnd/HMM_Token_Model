all the talent mr. sooraj barjatya showed in his first 3 movies, i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad. but i have to say it wasn't an accident. this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant. right from the first scene it affects you. the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome. the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol. as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic, so is anupam kher. but its a shahid-amrita film.amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom. this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life. all in all a brilliant film. hats off to mr. sooraj barjatya...
