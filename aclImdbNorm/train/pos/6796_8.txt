zodiac killer (2005) was an interesting film from german born director ulli lommel. he directs, produced and co-stars in this latest production. not only does he manage to make an interesting film on the cheap. but he reaches a new low when herr lommel works in footage from nearly his entire film catalog. i have seen film clips from boogeyman i and ii, war birds, tenderness of the wolf, brain waves and cocaine cowboys (even andy warhol makes a cameo from beyond the grave courtesy of this film). even though he uses plenty of old footage, he works them in well (and very creatively might i add).<br /><br />the film follows a young man who copies the original zodiac killer. he also corresponds with a writer (ulli lommel) who originally wrote about the serial killer during the late sixties and early seventies. the writer's friend (david hess) helps him to try and find this wannabe zodiac. can this killer be stopped? will the writer put two and two together and reclaim some of his old glory? is david hess still the man? you'll have to find out for yourself and watch the zodiac killer.<br /><br />this film is not about the original zodiac killer. i have also heard people whine about this film being shot on video. so what. the director's old school artistic style outshines the fact that it's shot on video. my only complaint was the over use of stock footage from herr lommel's earlier films (but i understand why "wink" "wink".) don't believe the hype. this is a gritty and street level horror film. like the disclaimer in the beginning states, this film does nor glorify murder. you got to like that statement.<br /><br />highly recommend for ulli lommel fans.
