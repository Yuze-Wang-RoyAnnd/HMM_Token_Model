i have to be honest, i was expecting a failure so bad, because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money. but that wasn't the case with this pretty funny (sometimes odd) movie. i loved how they told the story of timon and pumba, the story with simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny. the jacuzzi bubble, and when pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. it's all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. i think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to video and dvd movie. while the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end, it works. 8 out of 10
