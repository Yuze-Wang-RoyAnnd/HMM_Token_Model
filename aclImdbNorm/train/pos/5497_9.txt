a remarkable piece of documentary, giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself (for further evidence, check out some of the comments on imdb...!). compares extremely favourably with oliver stone's "comandante" (which is mainly an in-depth examination of fidel castro's nostril hairs). i don't know whether chavez is everything he presents himself as being, or yet another in the long line of populist latin-american "caudillos". nor do i know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of venezuelans. it's hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but i've certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of what's at stake, and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup. someone says in the film "we're making history", and that's exactly what the film feels like it's capturing. outstanding stuff.
