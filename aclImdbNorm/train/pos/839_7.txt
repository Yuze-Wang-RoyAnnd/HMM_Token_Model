think pierce brosnan and you think suave, dapper, intelligent james bond. in this movie, brosnan plays against type - and has lots of fun doing so (as does the audience). this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman... and it works!<br /><br />this is a fun movie, with very good scenes (a riveting, on-the-edge brosnan and a good, compliant "off"-the-edge kinnear have some good lines). my only cavil is that hope davis, playing the oh-so-tolerant wife ("can i see your gun?") doesn't appear more often: she could have been a marvellous foil to these men.<br /><br />this movie is like a matador: it plays with the audience, while "going for a kill". the ending is awesome because a storyline (with a positive moral!) emerges: this is a frenetic, frantic and fun movie, which does deserve a wide audience.
