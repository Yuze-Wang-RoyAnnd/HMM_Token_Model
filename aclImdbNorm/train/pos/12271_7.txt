talk about a blast opening, "trampa infernal" has the coolest opening credits ever! guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary "friday the 13th" theme (tsh-tsh-tsh-ha-ha-ha), the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables. promising intro of a totally obscure mexican slasher/backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes. two extremely competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar. according to a newspaper article, there's a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it. the challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls. upon arrival, however, it quickly becomes obvious they're not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve. after a whole decade of tame and derivative american slashers, this early 90's mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid. the formula is simplistic but efficient, the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful. the maniac must have been a fan of freddy krueger and michael myers, as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face. the murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric, which i was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences, and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood. the forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular. "trampa internal" is a mexican slasher/survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre.
