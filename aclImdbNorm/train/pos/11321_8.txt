when i started watching the show i said "oh, no! it's as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody!". and indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him.<br /><br />but this is where the resemblance stops. the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha, while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few. the magical setup is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the holy grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. however, this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script.<br /><br />i actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it with animes that i liked more, but were from other genres, i have to say that i was very pleased.
