a new side to the story of victoria and albert is brought to life by director jean-marc valle. most people's cursory thoughts of queen victoria is that of woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life in mourning. emily blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective. she portrays victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne, and early years. blunt's victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film. her strongest scenes are with albert (rupert friend) and lord melbourne (paul bettany). all the actors acquit themselves well including miranda richardson in what could of been a throw-away role.<br /><br />though this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic "acting" moments, the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing. there are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing, the film tries to stay true to the relationship between victoria and albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period. the set design and costumes are outstanding.<br /><br />this film will be most appreciated by those drawn to history, period dramas, and of blunt and the other actors. heartily recommend.<br /><br />grade: a
