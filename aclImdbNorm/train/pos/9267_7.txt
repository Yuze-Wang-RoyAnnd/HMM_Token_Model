not a bad film. somehow i was made to actually root for the iranians to win the game played in the movie even though i don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan. the ending on the bus was exhilarating.<br /><br />the film itself deals with the issue of women in iran, and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear. despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many of them get caught and detained. it's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender. in an interview, panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices, and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how iran once lived. one hopes that future will come sooner rather than later.
