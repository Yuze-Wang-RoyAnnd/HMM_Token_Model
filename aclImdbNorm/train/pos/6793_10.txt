i absolutely love this game to death. ever since i was 9 years old (i am now 15). it has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and don't forget the ultimately awesome dragoon forms! i am still waiting for a remake, prequel, or a sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /><br />you play as dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite the hero. on this adventure you encounter wondrous creatures and boss fights. you also encounter some friends on the way who have their own special element. such as fire, darkness, water/ice, thunder/lightning, earth, light, and wind. there are also items known as dragoon spirits, which allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend. dragons, wizards, creatures called winglies and evil creatures you'll have to face on this adventure of action-packed thrills and excitement. one of my all time favorite games, the legend of dragoon!
