this was different, that's for sure. just look at the cast! talk about oddballs.<br /><br />william h. macy and ben stiller were the stars, although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight, in this farce about superhero-wannabees. the most outrageous was played by paul reubens of "pee wee herman" fame.<br /><br />there is lots of humor, garish colors and no lulls. it's a pretty entertaining, lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters, all of whom want to be heroes a la superman, batman, spiderman, you name. they have talents in strange areas, however, that the real heroes don't (and don't want to!). it's silly, but you know that going on.<br /><br />it's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity. it's a long movie for one so hectic, so taking a break here and there is okay. the language was tame so kids could enjoy this, too. in fact, i don't recall any swearing in here, except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering, "what a dumb, f---ing movie." i thought it was fun two hours but i'd rather watch it on dvd and take a few breaks.
