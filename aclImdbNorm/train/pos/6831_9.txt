i only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with opening night and that's bergman';s persona. both movies are simply amazing, they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight. we have a profound meditation on the relation of art and life as one actress, myrtle gordon (gena rowlands), finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to. the accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl that declares her love for myrtle and she is then hit by a car, leaves a deep mark in the actress. she starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. but that doesn't help to much and myrtle is one step away from complete madness. the scene where she kill the imaginary (or not) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes i found in a cassavets film. the movie ends with a display of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and gena rowlands improvise a scene, since myrtle comes too drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately. this scene was filmed spontaneously, with a live audience, the laughter is genuine, the chemistry between casavates and rowlands absolutely amazing. if you liked persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine.
