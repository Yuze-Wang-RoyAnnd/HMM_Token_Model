i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not, this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes. i kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways, and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some abuse, or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own. this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the edies do their thing, i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong. very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you'll never forget it, but very disturbing.
