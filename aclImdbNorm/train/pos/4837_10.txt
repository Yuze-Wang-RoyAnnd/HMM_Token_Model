i was young film student in 1979 when the union of the soviet filmmakers came to sofia bulgaria and premiered konchalovsky's "siberiade"; tarkosvky's "stalker" and danelia'a "autumn marathon". i was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. then and only then, i saw "siberiade" 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was speechless. way better then bertolucci's "1900". by far!<br /><br />hope andron will somehow get to the negative and make "director's restored version full lenght " someday! on dvd of course! also i fiercely fought in defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating soviet film with bad taste! time is on my side.
