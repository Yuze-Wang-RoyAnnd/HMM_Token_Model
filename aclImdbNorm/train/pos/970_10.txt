now, i have seen a lot of movies in my day, but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me. and i'm a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience. this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies. almost all the acting is believable, the graphics are decent (for which you won't even be caring about as you watch the movie. trust me, bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do), the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kids.<br /><br />here's basically what this movie made me to. it one, made me laugh...a lot, two, made me feel for the characters like you're suppose to, and three, it's a very uplifting story. by the end of this movie you will feel good. sure, what anime out there hasn't featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil. it's a formula that is used a lot. but, in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you'd see 5 years ago, the appearance of it is not to be judged. it's very touching, the ending is original, and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to. if you however try comparing this to other movies like "the never-ending story" or whatever it will diverse your opinion. watch it as it is and you will enjoy it.<br /><br />it has been a good long while since i've been impressed like this. the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out. there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it. so don't over-analyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
