i have loved this movie all of my life. it's such an intelligent story also, with plenty of classical allusions. eg. the ship that went missing decades earlier was called the bellerophon. well, in classical mythology this was the man who slew the chimera, a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures. in fp, walter pidgeon is clearly the chimera- himself and his id monster. <br /><br />i like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters which spend $150m on special effects, but about $1.50 on a screenplay.<br /><br />cheers
