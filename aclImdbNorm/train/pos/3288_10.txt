this is a way cool fantasy movie. one of my faves, it really is so cool. the director is bernard rose who went on to direct candyman, he made a great start with this film.<br /><br />the film about a girl called anna who falls ill with glandular fever on her 11th birthday. she draws a house on a shred of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real. each subsequent dream that she has is altered by the presence of whatever she adds to the picture. in her third dream she meets a boy she thinks she has created called mark. she befriends him and their relationship becomes stronger as the dreams become darker and scarier.<br /><br />charlotte burke who plays anna is a terrific actress and it is very strange that, after just one film, she should disappear and never be in anything ever again. she really does give a great performance in this film.<br /><br />hans zimmer's score is also ace. much like broken arrow, the music is ghostly and mysterious. it's a real shame that the soundtrack is not available on cd anymore. the dvd is available in r2 only.
