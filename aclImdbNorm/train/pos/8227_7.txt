an interesting thriller that has paul winfield as a detective on the case of a murder. paul winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease, it was hard to tell the man was even acting. maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice/narrator of "city confidential", winfield ends his career with a so-so movie; but as always, winfield shines. a treat to watch.<br /><br />erika eliniak is well, erika eliniak, nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department. though, to be fair, this is one of her better efforts.<br /><br />bottom line: a watchable thriller that shouldn't be missed by any paul winfield fan. a decent telefilm to help send paul winfield off to celluloid heaven. what an actor. he will be missed.
