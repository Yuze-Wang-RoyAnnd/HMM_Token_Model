well "wayne's world" is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off-shoot movies. from such cinematic offal as "it's pat" to the recent 80 minute yawn, "a night at the roxbury," many have, no doubt, lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen. well fear not because tim meadows comes through in spades. the well-written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the leon phelps character introduced in the five minute skit, the storyline allows the character to develop. the humor (consisting largely of sex jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory. its a just great time if you don't feel like taking yourself too seriously. tiffany-amber thiessen of "saved by the bell" fame, makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible. finally billy dee williams, reliving his colt 45 days, gives the movie a touch of class. and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself, you will find this movie to be eminently quotable, "ooh, it's a lady!"
