for starters, i didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. i have not once seen it on tv before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. it is a pity though, because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in years.<br /><br />i don't hand out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points. even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. when the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep storyline, with a spiritual message. this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals, a old indian believe that has been preserved for many years. this gives the show a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows.<br /><br />the overall design is also something very different. at times it resembles spawn a bit in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach. i believe david feiss who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic).<br /><br />if you are looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end. one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. the only question remains though, where is the dvd?!
