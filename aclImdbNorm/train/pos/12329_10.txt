before viewing, please make sure you have seen night of the living dead... this might well be the best 7 minute parody i have ever seen! absurd, crappy 'special effects' (the rope, the rope!!!), and maneating slices of bread... what more do you need???<br /><br />(do not watch this movie while eating bread... you might get scared!)
