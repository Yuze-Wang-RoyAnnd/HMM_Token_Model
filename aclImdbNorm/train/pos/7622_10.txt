i love this show! it's like watching a mini movie each week!!! the first episode was so gripping and terrifying...so was part 2 of the pilot... i'm definitely gonna keep tuning into this show! this is the real survivor! i've looked at a few of the other comments and i can see that already after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying wolf... sorry if it's not another reality show, kiddies! there was once a time where there were...now brace yourself! actual tv shows! and this one is actually good unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today or the ump-teenth carbon copy of a law & order or nypd blue or csi series they're dishing out... watch this yourself to form your own opinion, don't take one from the boneheads here!
