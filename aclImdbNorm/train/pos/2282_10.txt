at first, i hadn't read the novel so far and i hadn't hear anything about the author yet. but as i casually saw this movie, i was totally captive by the story. already as the jewish watchman primary said, that he knows no one, who have a bad conscience about the war except from howard w. campbell junior, was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war. terrific! and the fictitious story about "the most effective spy for the usa in wwii", who have lost everything, that was important for his life, is wonderful emotional transcribed. this is the best story about the duality of humanity, i've ever heard about! the questions, this movie is introducing, are in my opinion very important for our society: when does someone bear the guilt of something? what is guilt? who is a hero and who is a felon? what is important in our life? can you live without paying attention to the political changes? is the protagonist guilty or not? these questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years. this is a must see for everyone, who have to think about the acception of war! this movie is a must see for everyone, who meditate, what matters in life and what doesn't...
