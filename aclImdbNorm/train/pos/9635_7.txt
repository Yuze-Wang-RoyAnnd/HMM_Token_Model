the romance of the movie, which is also its main theme, is good and nicely presented. however, the surrounding of the love story is too lyric, graphical and unrealistic. even worse, the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible, exactly like the end of the movie. don't hesitate to watch this movie, if it attracted your interest, but don't expect too much of it either.
