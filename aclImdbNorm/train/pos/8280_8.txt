george and kim are traveling with their young son miles to a remote cabin in upstate new york when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch.but what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey,where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit,half animal and half man wendigo,haunts a small town..."wendigo" by larry fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama.the acting is great,the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments.the subtle glimpses of wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined,or even if the story is taking place entirely in miles' head.overall,"wendigo" is my first contact with larry fessenden's work and surely won't be the last.give this film a chance,if you don't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10.
