"going berserk" is actually one of the funniest candy films i have ever seen, period. sure, it's kinda low budget, but it's a non-stop comedic tour de force. there are tons of memorable quotes. for instance, when his soon-to-be father-in-law asks him how much he earns, candy says "oh, i pull down anywhere between thirty and...eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." oh course, it is candy's delivery that sells it. just classic stuff. eugene levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker. a clip of his horrible low budget movie "kung fu u" will have you rolling.<br /><br />so if you are a candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, i can't recommend this movie enough.
