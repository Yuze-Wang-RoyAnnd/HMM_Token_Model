what a thrill ride! twisted and thought provoking. once again, sharon stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous, spellbinding character of author catherine tramell impeccably. the original basic instinct takes place in san francisco. the sequel takes place in london, where catherine has now relocated. both bustling cities known for excitement, haute couture ~ and a perfect place for someone like catherine trammel to take residency. david morrisey, ("derailed"), plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr. michael glass. the character david thewlis plays as roy washburn with scotland yard, is a refreshing departure from his role as lupin in the harry potter series. flashy cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor,tension, - all of the "basic instincts." mind bending throughout. great screenplay. from the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending, this film is anything but boring! everyone in the theater was glued to the screen.
