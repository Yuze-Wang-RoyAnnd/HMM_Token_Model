i have to say that this tv movie was the work that really showed how talented melissa joan hart is. we are so used to, now, seeing her in a sitcom and i really hope that a tv station will show this tv movie again soon as it will show the sabrina fans that mjh shines in a drama. seen as we have watched her on sabrina now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus. melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents "done away" with so she can be with the guy she loves. one thing that all sabrina viewers will notice, melissa works with david lascher in this, well before he took the role of josh on sabrina. so it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again. hopefully mjh gets some good roles in movies or even in more tv movies, sort of like kellie martin who has always shined in tv movies. lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to melissa joan hart, you shine always melissa!!!
