i'm not aware of "largo winch" as a comic book (or is it graphic novel? i actually don't know), but i have to admit, hearing about an agent/hero movie, i did expect quite something different, than what i actually got.<br /><br />while it was startling to watch this at first, it was nice watching this move along. you could never really tell where it would go (some twists are foreseeable, but in general, you can never really say, were it will end up going). a more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast, make this an enjoyable watch. not as action packed as some might hope or expect for a movie like that, but a really good mixture.
