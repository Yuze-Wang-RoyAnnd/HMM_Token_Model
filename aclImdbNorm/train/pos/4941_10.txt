i believe a lot of people down rated the movie, not because of the lack of quality. but it did not follow the standard hollywood formula. some of the conflicts are not resolved. the ending is just a little too real for others, but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining. even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting, the directing also is excellent and innovative.<br /><br />this is a 10 in my book, this movie will take you places the normal and expected hollywood script will not. they took some risks and did a few things different. i think it worked well, i am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer, not accepting someone else's interpretation.
