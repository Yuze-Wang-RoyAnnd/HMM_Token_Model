the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation. inoue replaces yasuzu masumura (blind beast, red angel, manji) in the director's chair, but the style is pretty much the same, perhaps due to shintaro katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular antihero.<br /><br />hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. of course, hanzo being hanzo, he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost, so he proceeds to rape... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. hanzo's superior officer, onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, and generally, it's business as usual.<br /><br />significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the finest in the hanzo series), but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits. complete with trademark training sequences, the obligatory rape, swordfights, and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately satisfy the fans.
