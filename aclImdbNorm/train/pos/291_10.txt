zombie chronicles isn't something to shout about, it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining b-movie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick. the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining, the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget, the gore is also great and gross, the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale. zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there, if you love low budget b-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles.
