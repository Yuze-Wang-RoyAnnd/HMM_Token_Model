although i really enjoyed jim carrey's latest "serious" performances ("the truman show", "man on the moon"), i've always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy. this is not to say he is a fantastic, talented actor: those bozos at the academy awards seem to dislike him so much, he has never had a (truly deserved) nomination or award. well, any "institution" that nominates for 11 oscars a bore such as "titanic" shouldn't be taken seriously.<br /><br />on with the review. "the grinch" is the sweetest, best looking, best acted, more enjoyable seasons film since "the nightmare before christmas". both movies seem very similar, too, with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing christmas. both make their principal actors seem like the villains (one in a higher degree than the other), both pack a strong moral lesson, and both are truly enjoyable.<br /><br />that is, until you realize that jack skellington is a doll, and the grinch is a human being. but a human being that is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoon-like, so unreal, that never gets in the way of the movie. he can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. he lives in a 3-dimensional world, where 3-dimensional people live. he jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately he saves the christmas. i loved this film to bits, and cannot wait for it to come out on dvd. this is one of those films you will really enjoy 10, 20 years from now. as timeless as they come.
