"toi le venin" is robert hossein's masterpiece,and one of the great thrillers of the fifties.based on a frederic dard novel,a writer the director often worked with (see also "le monte-charge" which hossein did not direct but in which he was the lead too),the screenplay grabs you from the first pictures on a desert road by night where a beautiful blonde might be the fieriest of the criminals to the mysterious house where he finds his femme fatale ..and her sister.then begins a cat and mouse play .one of the sisters is in a wheelchair .but is she really disabled?which one is the criminal who tried to kill the hero on that night? <br /><br />the two actresses,marina vlady and the late odile versois were sisters.<br /><br />turn off all the lights before watching.highly suspenseful.
