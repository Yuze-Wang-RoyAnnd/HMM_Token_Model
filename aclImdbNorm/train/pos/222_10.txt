a hilarious neil simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end. the late walter matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner (the late oscar-winner george burns) for a final reunion show on stage.<br /><br />benjamin martin is matthau's agent and nephew, and the two have just as much chemistry as matthau and burns. i love matthau's grumpy character--he's just the same as he always is, and yet also very different.<br /><br />burns, as the absent-minded old man, is just as funny as matthau.<br /><br />matthau: want some crackers? i've got coconut, pineapple and graham.<br /><br />burns: how about a plain cracker?<br /><br />matthau: i don't got plain. i got coconut, pineapple and graham.<br /><br />burns: okay<br /><br />matthau: they're in the cupboard in the kitchen.<br /><br />burns: maybe later.<br /><br />or how about this:<br /><br />matthau: when i did black, the whites knew what i was saying!<br /><br />you've got to see it in the movie to understand it!<br /><br />all in all, a refreshingly hilarious, sweet, heartfelt, warm, belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /><br />they just don't make them like this anymore! in a time when all the newest comedies are crude, juvenile and stupid, this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is--funny characters, smart and funny dialogue, and grand entertainment.<br /><br />one of the best buddy comedies of all time, right up there with "planes, trains and automobiles," "lethal weapon," and "the hard way."<br /><br />you may have a hard time finding this for rent or on tv, but trust me, it will be worth your time!<br /><br />4.5/5 stars.<br /><br />- john ulmer
