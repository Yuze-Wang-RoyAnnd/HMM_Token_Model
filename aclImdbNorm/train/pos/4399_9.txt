the most succinct way to describe ride with the devil is with but one word: authenticity. i will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film, but i would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer.<br /><br />as a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film, i must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding "bleeding kansas". yes there were liberties taken on the actual events, as all fiction is apt to do. but the overall feel of the film is genuine. authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (no pc hindsight here) even the actors look authentic.even jewel kilcher (who has a small part in the film) looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph.<br /><br />a few viewers i talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog. they cannot believe that 19th century farmers would "talk like poets".<br /><br />what they don't realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness, the american public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch. these people were raised on shakespeare and the king james version of the bible. the screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging from documentation of the time. the stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film.<br /><br />but in addition to a historical document, this film works on a visceral level as well. beautifully photographed and performed, it harkens back to the days of the great western epics. the raid on lawrence, kansas, done so many times before in so many other, lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action.<br /><br />romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict.this film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want. <br /><br />in a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like american beauty, this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system. but i am certain that ride with the devil will be given it's due in the coming years. please rent this film. you will not be disappointed.
