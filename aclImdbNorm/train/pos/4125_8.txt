i loved watching ''sea hunt '' back in the day , i was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4:30 would be ready to watch ''sea hunt '' and mike nelson in his underwater adventures .i loved it ! he took to you a place not very accessible at that time , under the great blue sea . pre ''thunderball '' or even before cousteau became common , there was mike nelson sparking the imagination of kids .i'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show .underwater photography also progressed , the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show . watch and enjoy !!!
