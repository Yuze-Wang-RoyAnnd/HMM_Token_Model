the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j-horror movie. this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story. the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks.<br /><br />the story is about perception of the people who works, lives, and loves of our protagonist, and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station dj booth. the story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash-backs as the movie runs its course, and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems. the movie mostly took place in a small, out-dated radio station's studio with a very bad history, where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re-locating. it is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co-workers or it was all in his mind. what i like about this film is that the film-makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did. this movie is a very smart, abide rather short 76 minutes film.
