the shining, you know what's weird about this movie? this is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that the shining is a terrific film. this is stanley kubrick's classic vision of stephen king's horror tale of madness and blood. this is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. who could forget jack's "here's johnny!"? who could forget "all work and no play make jack a dull boy"? who could forget that chilling ending? this is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is kubrick's best work. i know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it's 2001: a space odyssey or clockwork orange or even dr. strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then the shining perfected it. this is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. <br /><br />jack torrance, jack's son danny, and jack's wife, wendy arrive at the overlook hotel on closing day. the elderly african-american chef, dick hallorann, surprises danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. he explains to danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication "shining." danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly room 237. dick tells danny that the hotel has a certain "shine" to it and many memories, not all of them good, and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. danny's curiosity about room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after jack tells wendy that he loves his family. seeing this, wendy thinks jack has been abusing danny. jack wanders into the hotel's gold room where he meets a ghostly bartender named lloyd. danny starts calling out the word "redrum" frantically, and scribbling it on walls. he goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is tony, his own "imaginary friend." jack sabotages the hotel radio, cutting off communication from the outside world, but hallorann has received danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. wendy discovers that jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating "all work and no play makes jack a dull boy" formatted in various ways. horrified, jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. jack converses with grady through the door of the locker, which then unlocks releasing him. danny has written "redrum" in lipstick on the door of wendy's bedroom. when she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is "murder" spelled backwards. jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. "here's johnny!", and jack's legendary image is born.<br /><br />the shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. jack nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. but one i also feel is extremely overlooked is shelley duvall, her scene of finding jack's rant all work
