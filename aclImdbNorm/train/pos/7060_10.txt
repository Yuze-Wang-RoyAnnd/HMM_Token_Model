many people have commented that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first. well, maybe it isn't - to you. however, how does your child react to it? well, mine loved it more than the first.<br /><br />disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids. (for example - bambi's mother getting shot.) this movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings.<br /><br />if you want to be snobby about what should be disney's standards based on the past - skip this movie. <br /><br />if you have a sweet little girl or soft-hearted little boy you really want to please, buy this movie and treat your small children. this film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares. i'm happy with a movie that pleases my kid & doesn't need to impress the parents all the time.
