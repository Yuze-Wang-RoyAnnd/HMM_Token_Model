this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because: <br /><br />the missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good. the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do. this james bond game has a good story to it. the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool. also the graphics in this game pretty good.<br /><br />overall score ********* out of **********
