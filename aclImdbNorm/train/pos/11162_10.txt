high energy raoul walsh classic from 1933, the bowery places saloon owner and operator wallace beery against bitter rival and dandy, george raft, with adopted street kid jackie cooper and good looking faye wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry. it's not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about, but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids. plenty of wisecracks at the beginning, but the characters soften up as the film progresses. apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in beery's saloon. the various characters, sexy chorus line, lots of drinking, a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so-called pre-code restrictions, and then later come the carrie nations led by carrie nation herself. it all creates a very vivid picture of a life that's long gone. i don't like to compare eras, but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today. the film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see.
