my left foot is an epic outstanding film explaining the life and times of christy brown,who had cerebral palsy,a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot,but he was defiant,he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds<br /><br />i have seen this film a lot of times and each time i see it,i find it equally brilliant each time.i wonder how did this amazing film not win an oscer for best picture,it is a shambles by the academy awards. jim shirdan is to me one of the greatest directors in the world.the screenplay,the music and anything else is excellent in this film. as the film goes on,you would nearly feel your in the brown household as everything occurs.ray macanally and brenda fricker are amazing as cristies parents and fiona shaw is equally brilliant as d.r eileen cole,who helps christy on his battle of defiance.<br /><br />the irish film industry had noting much to its name before my left foot.my left foot was the start of a wonderful period in irish film. films so powerful and brilliant such as the field,the crying game,in the name of the father and michael collins followed my left foot.these irish films were regarded so highly around the world and were nominated for multiple oscers and won some,a wonderful period for irish film.my left foot is a powerful outstanding film.<br /><br />daniel day-lewis plays the crippled christy brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for hugh o conner who plays young christy.to me those two performances are two of the best ever film performances,especially daniel day-lewis's performance which i would regard as high as antony hopkins in the silence of the lambs. daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is an great actor.<br /><br />this is an excellent masterpiece in film,see it!
