for persons of a certain age, w.w. ii was the defining time of their lives, and whatever followed could never compare. as the movie opens, a recently widowed but still lively woman (judi dench) hears a street musician gamely attempting to play the classic song, "stardust."<br /><br />this recalls her memories of when she played in an almost all-girl band that entertained between bomb raids during the war. the drummer, patrick (ian holm), happily avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies.<br /><br />patrick and dench's character meet and decide to reunite the band, which takes them on a series of mini-adventures. despite ups and downs, the band does reunite and makes a successful reappearance.<br /><br />the movie is exquisitely written and understated, with superb performances from all involved. the characters are well-developed and all people who have not quit living, despite their years. and there's all that glorious old swing music!<br /><br />this isn't the pontification of steven spielberg, but a serious movie nevertheless. the war affected everyone and that lesson is not forgotten in a movie that isn't afraid to entertain as it teaches.
