gung ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time. the result is uneven, but generally entertaining. keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well. wantabedde is even better. one warning: george wendt is very poor in his supporting role. otherwise, this is quite enjoyable time capsule.
