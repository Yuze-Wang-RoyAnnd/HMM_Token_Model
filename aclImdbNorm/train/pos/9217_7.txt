this truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters, just about every voluptuous middle-aged female in hollywood, and a touching, funny love story. the capomezza's and the malacici's are rival caterers in an italian neighborhood in new york. they are also at opposite--extreme--ends of the taste scale. their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of romeo and juliet. naturally, they fall in love. on stage! the mayhem and confusion that this causes, as the parents feud with each other and their kids, is played out for us against the backdrop of the capomezza's magnificently tasteless home, and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings.<br /><br />besides the four over-the-top parents and the charming young lovers, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, a plain-speaking grandma, a lady who waves a wand and passes on spiritual advice she receives from a medium called the blessed roscoe, a motel with beds shaped like the back seat of a car, and two doves. there is not a sight gag or a punch line that doesn't click in this fast paced movie.<br /><br />even the family names of the two families are part of the fun. "capomezza" could be interpreted as "low-brows," and "malacici" could mean "stuck-up snobs." <br /><br />if you are sensitive about italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. if bette midler embarrasses you, you may not like it, because all of the women in this movie make bette midler look like martha stewart. the rest of us should love it!
