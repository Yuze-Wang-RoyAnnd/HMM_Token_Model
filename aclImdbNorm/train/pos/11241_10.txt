i acquired this, one of my all-time favourite films on dvd recently and as usual, during viewing, the whole thing just blew me away.<br /><br />i am a massive fan of hazel o'connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears, especially the "will you" track. it's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. this rates second best to quadrophenia (which also starred phil daniels).<br /><br />a great soundtrack and a great view of britain in the thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which i grew up. the ending is so sad, for hours after the end of the film i am like a blubbering baby.<br /><br />i expect to wear out this dvd from repeated viewing, i can watch it over and over again and never be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />hazel, sorry to hear about your dad darling. god bless you all. xx
