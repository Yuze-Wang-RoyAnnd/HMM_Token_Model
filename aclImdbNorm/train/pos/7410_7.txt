i happened on "shower" in the foreign film section of my local video store and passed it over several times since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy. i then lucked into a copy to purchase at economical price and am happy for my luck. "shower" is the story of three(3) men, a father and two(2) adult sons, each coming to terms with life changes as the world around them also continues to change in modern china. as with many "foreign" films, the chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this movie.<br /><br />beyond the fascinating characteristics of the local, chinese color giving the setting to this story, is the difficult yet touching relationships between the men and a sole woman involved in the story, all set against the backdrop of a village bathhouse.<br /><br />the family's story moves from estrangement to understanding and made me glad i came to know these people. added to the main story are the numerous small characters, bathhouse customers, and their individual conflicts and friendships. "shower" is a film one walks away from smiling and touched by its warmth and humanity.
