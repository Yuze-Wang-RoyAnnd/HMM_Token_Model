i have a thing for old black and white movies of this kind, movies by will hay and abbot & costello especially as those are my favourites. i picked this movie up on dvd as it was using the same idea as will hay's "oh mr porter" which is one of the finest comedies ever made. i just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie finished at 12:45am). i find that movies of this kind, to do with ghost trains, etc, are best viewed at night time with the lights out. that way you get into the storyline more and night time viewing works well with this movie.<br /><br />the one-liners in the movie may seem a little dated to some viewers, i guess this depends on the viewer. they are not dated to me though. i am 28 and even though i am not old enough to have been around when this movie was first released (my dad was though). i still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind. sitting in the room in front of the tv with some snacks and drinks and kicking back and relaxing at night while watching these movies, not many things can beat the feeling you get while doing this. it is an escape from reality for a while.<br /><br />i noticed that one of the men in the movie (he has a black mustache) he appears about three quarters of the way through the movie after his car crashes and he is looking for a woman he was followed to the station. this man was in the will hay classic "the ghost of st michaels" as well. just thought i'd point that out in case no one noticed :).<br /><br />the set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric. outside the abandoned station looks good and as if there is not a soul for miles in any direction, and the inside of the station is very cosy looking away from the rain storm that is outside. i felt like i would have loved to have been there in the movie with the cast. the atmosphere in this movie is something that is missing from a lot of movies now. it keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts till it finishes.<br /><br />we need more of this type of movie in todays market. but sadly it could be over looked in favour of movies with nudity and swearing and crude humour. this sort of movie making era (the ghost train, oh mr porter, etc) to me is the golden age of cinema!.
