lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series. what made it so good to me when i watched it was the real feel of going underwater. the show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is infectious.<br /><br />the show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro, mike nelson. there were excellent shows, and the program always appeared to be well produced. granted, the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode but each show holds it's own with any other show produced during this era, the infancy of american television.
