jerome crabbe has the lead role in this movie. i saw this movie 6 times and i still am not tired of it. this movie is similar to flesh + blood in some ways. gerald soetman is a great writer. he wrote all of paul verhoeven's dutch films. paul verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. i have seen all of his movies all except for showgirls. my mom does not like him so much but i disagree. i think all of his films are a ride to watch especially total recall and basic instinct. jerry goldsmith did some of his movies which include total recall, basic instinct and hollow man. i wish jerry goldsmith never died. dutch films are different but still enjoyable.
