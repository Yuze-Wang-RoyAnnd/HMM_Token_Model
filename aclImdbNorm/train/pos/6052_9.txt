highly recommended!!<br /><br />a well written, funny film which will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humour!!!. give it a go, it's good to see an independent british movie more than holding it's own against the big established studios!! definitely worth adding to any film collection. there are scenes in this film that i'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to. you will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack. i especially enjoyed the orb's version of jimmy cliff's vietnam and the tower of london's take on freebird. <br /><br />go on give it a go............ you won't be disappointed.
