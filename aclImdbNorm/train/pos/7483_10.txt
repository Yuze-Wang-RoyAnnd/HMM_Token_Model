vanilla sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie abre los ojos (open your eyes). and in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. tom cruise plays david aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes other people's emotions for granted, and thinks only of himself. jason lee plays brian shelby, david's best, and in many ways, only friend. penelope cruz plays sofia serrano, brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to david's birthday party. cameron diaz plays julie gianni, david's occasional bed buddy. kurt russell plays dr. curtis mccabe, a psychologist interviewing david. all of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make vanilla sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made. i won't explain anymore of the plot, because it's far more compelling, the less you know. ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow. if you pay attention, you won't be confused. the film is very complex, but not confusing. and in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.
