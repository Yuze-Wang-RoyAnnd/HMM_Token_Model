after seeing this film at the sf independent film festival, i couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy. jim mckay gave a talk (q&a) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on resolving controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. the multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of "real teen life." most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt, "a film teens should see because it's about them." hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? the internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like "pups" or other radical modern teen films--and mckay seemed responsive. as for his credits as a writer/director, mckay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the crown heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic.
