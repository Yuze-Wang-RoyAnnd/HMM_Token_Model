true, the idea for this tv series may have sprung from the immense success which ally mcbeal is enjoying worldwide, even here in germany. however, this said, edel & starck is very different from ally mcbeal in many ways.<br /><br />the two main characters work beautifully together. felix edel (felix noble), played by well-known german actor, christoph m. ohrt and sandra starck (sandra strong - noble & strong, get it ???), played by charming rebecca immanuel, exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom-like criminal cases in berlin and surroundings. further, they are aided by a magnificent cast of co-stars, most notably their secretary, played by isabel tuengerthal, who is a rare gem with great comic potential. also the shady wheeler-dealer, otto, and the noble childhood pal of felix, frank, work very well, not to forget sandra's best friend and room-mate, patricia, played by the beautiful barbara demmer.<br /><br />all-in-all a joy to watch on monday nites: no wonder that the series and its stars have received several prizes. will felix get sandra ?<br /><br />i hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out......
