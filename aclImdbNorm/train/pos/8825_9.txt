this 2004 oscar nominee is a very short b/w film in spanish. a young woman goes into a caf'e, gets a coffee, and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments. all the patrons are motionless, like mannequins. one guy, however, is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7:35 in the morning. there is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite, well, surprising. the people, the place, everything looks quite ordinary. and like the musical piece "bolero", the thing keeps building until the climax. with its structure, theme,movement and wit,it is an 8 minute masterpiece.
