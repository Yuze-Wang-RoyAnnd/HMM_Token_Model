perhaps in an attempt to find another "hot property" for adaptation, the brothers fleischer thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the newspaper comic strip with their production of 1933's popeye the sailor (fleischer studios/paramount). although it was a part of the betty boop series, miss b. only made a brief appearance in the short; leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown series.<br /><br />as is now common knowledge, the gruff, squinty eyed, brawlin' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever; outlasting and literally outliving the fleischers and their studio, lasting to this day.<br /><br />returning to king features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular henry comic strip character in a betty boop outing; objective being the seeking of another series. the reasoning then surely seemed sound. henry was a most popular feature in the hearst papers' line-up; appearing as both a daily and on sunday's color comics supplement, puck, the comics weekly. you know, "what fools these mortals be!" remember that one, schultz? in viewing the chubby, little, bald boy comic strip 'hero' and his on screen antics, both solo and in tandem with miss betty; we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled. the story and director dave fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip-like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry. these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page; as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime'.<br /><br />in the cartoon, titled betty boop with henry: the funniest living american (fleischer studios/paramount pictures corporation, 1935), we see what is; basically being a one situational exercise; being punctuated with the usual array of dave fleischer's rapid fire, machine gun-like gags. in short, henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boop's pet shop. it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had, to coins in his pocket. he is in formed by miss boop that it would be $2.00 in depression era money to make the purchase. tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly.<br /><br />but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store, while she leaves on urgent business. in return for his services, miss betty promises him the little dog in return. of course, they have a deal and betty leaves.<br /><br />getting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the fleischer crew to fire up a whole new string of gags; this time featuring bird seed, henry's bald pate and push brooms. (but not all at once of course, schultz!) henry's enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds; out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break.<br /><br />betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with henry's temporary custodial care. all bets were off, no doggie for henry. he begins to leave; dejectedly; but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up. his head covered with bird seed, he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures; returning them to their pet store coop. happily, the little fella leaves; but this time he has his own affectionate, little, face licking puppy.<br /><br />undoubetly this was a winning combination. we have the carefree, energy filled, free wheeling of the boy, the kindness of betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation. max and dave fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor mini-masterpiece of a surreal comedy short.<br /><br />we were quite surprised that no henry series followed. judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character, it certainly could have been sustained for some time. at any rate, this teaming was in many ways the best of the betty boop try out pictures. although the first, popeye the sailor (fleischer/paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and barely had any betty boop in it, save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer); the henry short was much better than the two following king features "tryouts", betty boop and the little king and betty boop and little jimmy, both 1936.<br /><br />poodle schnitz!!
