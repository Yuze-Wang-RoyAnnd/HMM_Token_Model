this is a great canadian comedy series. the movie tells of how the stars jean paul tremblay-(julian) and the head writer of the show and his buddies rickie and bubbles play it over the top in what is a true life satirical look at trailer parks and the denizens of said trashy hoods. the movie will tell you why rickie and julian begin doing their more advanced forays into the world of crime. why and the reasons behind everything would be a spoiler so i shall not give the real reasons behind their more brilliant escapades. their friend and oft-time partner(bubbles) is a brilliant character. the whole show is brilliant and missing the movie will not affect the way you see the sit-com one bit. it is a comedy with a capital c and a brilliant satire on trailer park living and small time crooks with small time ideas but big time dreams. if you ever have the opportunity to watch--buy--steal this program grab it. you will be glad you did. and to my american friends---it will break you up also. 10 out of 9. brilliant. tv how tv should be.
