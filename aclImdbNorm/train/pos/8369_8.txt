hrm-i think that line was from the old movie posters.<br /><br />this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator. here's a tip: any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading "in the future..." is going to be fun. this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you.<br /><br />in this case, "in the future..." means that, instead of fighting wars, nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine, well, that's never terribly clear, but it's probably something really important. there are good guys (obviously capitalists, i.e. "us") and bad guys (commies!) and there are big stop-motion robots.<br /><br />sadly, the effects budget was pretty slim, so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots. there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes, and then a big space fight near the end. the space fight is especially nice, as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget.<br /><br />with said money now spent, the climactic fight degenerates into (and i'm not making this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. i can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene, complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads.<br /><br />like i said-it's dumb. that's why i bought the tape.
