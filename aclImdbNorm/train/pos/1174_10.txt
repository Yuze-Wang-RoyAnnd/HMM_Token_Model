some people have stated that as of the 11th season, south park has started a trend of leaving behind their politically biting satire for shallow spoofs; but this could not be further from the truth.<br /><br />while this episode does spoof the living dead series, there is more. it is a satire of how people treat the homeless. characters say things like "they're pretending to be just like us" or "they want to be human." this episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often just down on their luck.<br /><br />so yes, it is still a satire, and also a wonderful spoof. what more could you want?
