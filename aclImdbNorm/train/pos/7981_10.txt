in mexico city, the former cia assassin and presently an alcoholic decadent man john creasy (denzel washington) is hired by the industrialist samuel ramos (marc anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend rayburn (christopher walken), to be the bodyguard of his young daughter pita (dakota fanning) and his wife lisa (radha mitchell). pita changes the behavior of the cold creasy, making him live and smile again, and he feels a great affection for her. when the girl is kidnapped and creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals, he swears to kill each one responsible for the abduction.<br /><br />"man on fire" is almost a masterpiece, and will become certainly a classic in the future. the story is excellent, never corny and although having 146 minutes running time, the viewer does not feel time passing. the cast is composed by excellent actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, highlighting denzel washington, dakota fanning and radha mitchell. the cinematography has wonderful moments, and the screenplay has stunning lines. i personally loved when the character of christopher walken explains to manzano (giancarlo giannini) that creasey's specialty is death, and he is preparing his masterpiece. i agree with the user that commented that "man on fire" is one of the best, if not the best, film of the year in this genre. my vote is ten.<br /><br />title (brazil): "chamas da vinganca" ("flames of the revenge")
