ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces (i found only the egyptian one disappointing). stragely, all but the mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: the afghan refugees, deaf people, palestinians, the widows of srebrenica, aids and poverty and corruption in africa, pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath, suicide bombings in israel, paranoia-hit and state-persecuted muslim americans in the usa, old people living alone, and the aftermath of wwii in the hearts of asian soldiers. this might say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both ways: the directors might feel that americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies, while they effectively do the same with their short films.<br /><br />surprising myself, i found sean penn's piece one of the very best in the collection, and ***spoiler ahead*** i also guess his portrayal of ernest borgnine as a half-crazy old man vegetating in a new york flat experiencing his widow life's happiest moment when the sun shines through his window after the wtc "collapsed out of light's way", i guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general american audience would see it.
