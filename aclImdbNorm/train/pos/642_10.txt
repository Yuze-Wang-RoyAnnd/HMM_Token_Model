i was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a french actress friend of mine.<br /><br />for the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood, hating this film, hating myself and even hating the french actress. and then...<br /><br />i don't know what happened but i was pulled into the film in a way that i hadn't been in years. and this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to do each changeover by hand. i was in the theater for close to four hours, but it was worth it. <br /><br />i believe that great movies pull you inside a world, make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink. this film did that. it was one of the best filmgoing experiences i have ever had.<br /><br /> <br /><br />
