saw this in the theater in '86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once. "beirut"..."what do you know about beirut?"..."beirut...he's the best damn baseball player who ever lived."<br /><br />you know how it's going to end but it has a great time getting there. the training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when jack and reno are attempting to watch the falcons v. vikings monday night football game while attempting a make-up dinner with their wives.<br /><br />williams and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it's too bad that it's overlooked as a top notch comedy.
