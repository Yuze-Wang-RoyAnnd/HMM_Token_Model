this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town. one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor, when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever. definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you! a powerful piece of work. this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.<br /><br />*spoiler!!! spoiler alert!! spoiler!!*<br /><br />the main character is taken by her young, handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms. her two jealous "friends" play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy. she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop. in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together.(in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted)
