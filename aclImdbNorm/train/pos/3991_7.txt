"if i sit down i will never stand up again", that's what the mother (the one of the title) says to his son when he tells her to get some rest (she's just widowed). he means that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do: to rest in peace, to neglect herself. but she's not in the mood for "resting", not yet. she also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disasters in her life... suddenly, the revelation comes: sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her (daniel craig, the brand new james bond) when she "thought nobody would ever touch her again". it is a story that makes you reflect on many things, specially on what's a 60 something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies. it doesn't look that we've advanced that such in those aspects. i mean, nobody's surprised when sean connery has a love affair in a movie with catherine zeta jones... but what would you think if it was otherwise? an old woman, a young guy... nah, you ain't ready for that, are you?<br /><br />the movie has intimist tones all along its length, except for 2 or 3 sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul-mouthed dialogs. those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mother's love affair (pretty absurd -you'll know what i mean when you watch it-) are the only discordant elements in "the mother". <br /><br />*my rate: 7/10
