although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows: "fire in space" and "living legend", if you watch the original shows you'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out. i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. i would say if you want to see the show in its original version, see the video versions on vhs. they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now. another good video is conquest for the earth, which had more scenes from galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves. overall, i rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers.
