bell, book and candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenoms we see today (back in the 70's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). it made novak a huge star, put a nice item on jack lemon's resume, cast new light on jimmy stewart, and gave lancaster and gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both went on to continue to play witches and other curious "old bats", in film and television).<br /><br />along with the 40s movie i married a witch (which helped to make veronica lake an icon), bell, book and candle inspired the grand film and tv fascination with all things witchy that began with bewitched and has continued through practical magic, worst witch and harry potter.<br /><br />what i rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative xmas movie. the story takes place over the christmas holidays, and, despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft, actually embodies a great deal of xmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc).<br /><br />i will always watch this movie (have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. it has style, substance, a great cast, and terrific production values. and like adam's rib, it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time, are radical even now (in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful), and so always seems ahead of the times.
