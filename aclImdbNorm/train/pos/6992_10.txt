i wouldn't say this is a bad movie; in fact it's pretty typical of the type of film that the "poverty row" studios were releasing at the time. filmed for monogram, bela lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the community. in this movie, bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides, and, after their demise, injecting bela's wife with a serum taken from their bodies in order to keep her young. lugosi is more than up to the task in making this an enjoyable film, however, the movie suffers from the ultra-wooden acting of co stars luana walters and tristram coffin. coffin (nice name for a guy in a horror flick) is especially bad in this case. i've seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same; stiff, wooden and utterly unconvincing. miss walters is only slightly better, but she too lacks the acting talent to make her role believable. still, the viewer can enjoy the great lugosi act out yet another dastardly scheme only to be foiled in the end! despite the poor acting by some, "the corpse vanishes" is an enjoyable movie for all to see.
