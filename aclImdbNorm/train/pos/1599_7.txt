"moonstruck" is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller, norman jewison (in the heat of the night, fiddler on the roof, the hurricane). the film is great on many levels. it shows a good slice of italian culture, has a touching romance, and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy.<br /><br />one thing i liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors. nicolas cage looks positively odd for most of the film, and cher... well, cher always looks a little odd.<br /><br />overall, it's a fun film, and easy to recommend.<br /><br />7.4 out of 10
