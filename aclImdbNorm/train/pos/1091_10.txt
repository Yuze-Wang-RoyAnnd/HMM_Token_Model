i loved this film. i first saw it when i was 20 ( which was only four years ago) and i enjoyed it so much, i brought my own copy the next day. the comedy is well played by all involved. i always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where mr. tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area. also look for jason robards father who plays mr. retch. talent ran in that family.
