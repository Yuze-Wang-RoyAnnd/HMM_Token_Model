this could be the most underrated movie of its genre. i don't remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didn't do so well at the box office. however, frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie. i rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list.<br /><br />movie begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself "god's hand". and then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case. during that trip, the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began. fenton and adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims that he has received a divine message from god asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings. he receives from god a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission.<br /><br />this is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat. the tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) get killed and religious experiences are questioned. it has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end. if you like this genre, i highly recommend frailty for you. i own the dvd and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thrillers.
