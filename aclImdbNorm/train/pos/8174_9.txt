i love this movie. as a kid, this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch. sure, it is mild now, but back in the day, it was awesome. dentists are one thing so many people fear, so why not do a movie about a killer dentist? it's cheesy, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it is awesome. and i have always had a love for medical horror. and corbin bernsen plays dr. feinstone perfectly, no one could have done it better. and for a low budget horror film, the effects and such are quite good. and i also love the theme music, it goes well with the film. ken foree (dawn of the dead) is also in this one playing a nosy cop, and does a fine job. there is a fair amount of blood, and some really cool torture/death scenes. check this one out!
