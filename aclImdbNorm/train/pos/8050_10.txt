the most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again. an early sammo film that has him imitating his character's hero, bruce lee, sammo is amazingly lee like in his actions and fighting. the way he slips into bruce's style and then back to his own, more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art. throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all - comedy (some unintentional, like the fake black guy), action and some incredible fight scenes.<br /><br />a great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time.
