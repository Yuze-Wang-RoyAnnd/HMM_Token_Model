i really enjoyed this movie. it succeeded in doing something that few movies do now; it provided family values while entertaining me. nancy drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to. the little girls i was with throughly enjoyed the movie and kept talking about nancy as we walked out of the theater. the movie has relatively few problems for families and i don't think parents will get bored sitting in the theater. no, it won't win an oscar and it did not showcase magnificent special effects or even provide a horribly spooky mystery, but it entertained me and it stood true to the the spirit of the books. i would definitely recommend this movie to anybody with a young girl (she will love it!) or any fan of the books. you will not be disappointed.
