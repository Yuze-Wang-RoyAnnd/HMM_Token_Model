the secret fury, in many ways a run-of-the-mill romantic suspense drama (directed by mel ferrer) boasts top-notch principals in colbert and ryan; it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end, when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief -- as so often it does in this genre. but for some viewers the film's highlight will be the portrayal of blowsy leah by vivian vance -- the immortal ethel mertz on "i love lucy." oddly, vance had very few film roles; her true home was broadway, where (among other gigs) she understudied for ethel merman. here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid suborned to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme; watch her half-heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when she's puffing a furtive cigarette in the hotel's linen-storage room -- a transgression for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty.
