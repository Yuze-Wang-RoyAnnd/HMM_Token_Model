i really enjoyed this debut by ring director, hideo nakata. if you've seen ring beforehand then you'll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick. it's got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre. if you like films that give you the chills, then you will probably like this one. a good, creepy debut by hideo nakata. 8/10
