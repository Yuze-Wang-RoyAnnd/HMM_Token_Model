the third fred macmurray/carole lombard film is a bit more serious than hands across the table and the princess comes across. it's yet another adaption of the play burlesque which apparently was popular back in the day.<br /><br />the original play burlesque ran on broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances and it's the role that carole lombard plays that barbara stanwyck originated on broadway that brought her to hollywood. a version starred nancy carroll in the early days of talkies and later on betty grable and dan dailey did still another version of it in when my baby smiles at me.<br /><br />in fact i have a vinyl album of a radio version that al jolson and ruby keeler did for the lux radio theater. that's an interesting work, believe me.<br /><br />anyway macmurray and lombard do fine by the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub where lombard is a singer and macmurray is a jazz trumpeter. note a nice performance by dorothy lamour as the latin vixen who gets between fred and carole. also anthony quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the make for lombard.<br /><br />swing high, swing low holds up real nice today and i wouldn't be surprised if we see yet another version of burlesque for the twenty first century.
