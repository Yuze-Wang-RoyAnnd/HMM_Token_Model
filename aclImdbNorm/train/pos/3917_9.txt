i first saw this movie when it was released in the u.s. in 1984. i have seen it many, many times since. what strikes me about the film is the incorporation of the art of the rehearsal into the lives of the characters and visa versa. throughout the movie the two intertwine and at times one is never too sure if one is watching the lives of the characters or a scene from a rehearsal. this continues up to the climax of the film. all these years later my friends and i still love to debate whether or not "carmen" is really stabbed at the end. from the reactions of the other characters, to the stylized murder, it is open to debate. the passion of the dance, the quality of the acting, the love of art, and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a superb movie that, once again, blends and twists the line between life and art.
