the best treasure island ever made. they just don't make films<br /><br />like this anymore, or ever. no one makes films like this. more<br /><br />than a novelty, this film is funny, frank and fascinating, yet moody,<br /><br />mysterious and morose. this is one of my favorite pictures. the<br /><br />director must have had some idea what it is all about, but he<br /><br />certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations, while leaving little left to the imagination. why he<br /><br />has not made more films like this, i have no idea. while<br /><br />reminding me of some of the best noir, it is one of a kind. but this<br /><br />is not for the lazy or simple.
