"journey of hope" tells of a poor turkish family and their odyssey of hope which spirals downward into despair as they travel to switzerland in search of prosperity. although this oscar winning film is fairly well crafted, it is lacking in substance and has many implausibilities. much of the film's 1.7 hour run time is get on the bus, get off the bus, get on the boat, get off the boat, get in the van, get out of the van, etc.; time which could have been better spent or left out completely. the story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who have an awareness of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. a worthwhile and reasonably entertaining watch but over-rated.
