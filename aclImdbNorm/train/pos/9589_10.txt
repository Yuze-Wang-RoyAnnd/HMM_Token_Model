growing up in nyc in the late 80's/early 90's club-scene, i can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period. no madonna did not come up with the idea of voguing but this is where she got it from! instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights, voguing allowed people to "fight" within the confines of everything short of touching each other (which would warrant an automatic disqualification). seeing these kind of extraordinarily talented/well orchestrated "throw-downs" in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are here...pepper la beija, paris dupr'ee,xtragavaganza, etc...all commemorated in the likes of such period-pieces as malcom mclaren's song "deep in vogue"...it didn't matter who you were, or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this "magic kingdom" of sorts, you became part of something bigger than yourself/you were important/and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination...and anybody from anywhere could become king (or queen) as the case may have been. the words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor. all of the tension, excitement, and magic of that very urban nyc energy is captured in this film. brilliant!!! please release on dvd for the world to see!!! thank you!
