to all of yall who think 1.this was a boring telecast 2.halle berry and denzel washington did not deserve their oscars<br /><br />shut the f**k up!! this was one of the best academy awards show because 1.it was a moment in history to have a black yes "black actress" win an academy award for best actress so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years.to be honest i had stop watching the academy awards because of a lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees.to me it was nothing but a bunch of white people patting each other in the back.the academy had many chances to vote black actresses that were brilliant in movies eg alfre woodard,whoopi goldberg,diana ross,mary jean babtise, but it did not 2.halle berry deserved that oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long have deserving actresses been ignored by the academy the majority of which is comprised of white voters yeah yeah nicole kidman sang very prettily in muling rouge!but it was time black people were accommodated in these awards shows.as for mr washington the academy owed him big time after that unfair loss for malcomx.to all of you who think race is not an issue"probably white people"in the movie industry,well it is many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereo typical made by white people roles of what they think is a black women or are not existence"angela basset". i do not expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it.come to think of it they are the one who been inflicting it
