in arlington heights, il we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools (1961) so i rode my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game. true, i was 11, but i thought it was the greatest thing on! i'd draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it. i also remember winning wonderful cars (pontiac or oldsmobile) if the contestant got the final hidden picture game. i even had the home version!<br /><br />i wonder why this game lasted so briefly. i enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures - the only one i could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden stream.<br /><br />really good memories are connected with camouflage.
