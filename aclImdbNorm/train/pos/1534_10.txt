i love this show as it action packed with adventure, love and intrigue. well some times love! it's so good see a show where all the characters work well together and they treat each other with respect. it's also very good to se dick van dyke in a television role as i have only seen him in mary poppins. the mixture of the main characters, mark, amanda, jesse and steve is very capturing to the audience. this is a show you have to watch!
