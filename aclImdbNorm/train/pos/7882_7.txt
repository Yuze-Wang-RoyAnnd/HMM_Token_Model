"ship ahoy" was probably made in order to showcase mgm talent. the film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to san juan, puerto rico, at the time in which the country was involved in wwii. this was typical fare for the studios, which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living.<br /><br />the beautiful eleanor powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with. red skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too much clowning, as he pursues the beautiful ms. powell on the ship that is bringing them to puerto rico. the irresistible bert lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man. also virginia grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone.<br /><br />there are good musical numbers featuring tommy dorsey and his orchestra, in which one sees, among others, the amazing buddy rich, who has a few solos with mr. dorsey and ms. powell. a young frank sinatra appears also as the lead singer of the band, backed by the pied pipers.<br /><br />this is a nostalgic trip that should be savored by fans of this genre, which mgm totally controlled.
