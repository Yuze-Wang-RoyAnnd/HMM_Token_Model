... but i enjoyed this show anyway. i've been reading some of the comments prior reviewers have had to say about this show, and i'm having a hard time completely nullifying all the criticism in my own head (except one: that the show was stale; this program was anything but stale). a lot of the stuff people take issue with about this show is on the money: pretentious; forced; overwrought; desperate for attention; self-satisfied; annoying ever-present narration. but you know what? i really liked it. it was different, it was original, it really, really tried; and that made up for all the minuses. the show was bright, verbal, quick, witty, interesting, fun to look at ... you know, it was only on once a week, i could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it. i will mourn its passing. but i guess nobody will be bringing this back to life.
