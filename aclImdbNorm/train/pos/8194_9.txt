despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best dirty harry movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country's socio-political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early '80's. it's also a kickass action movie.<br /><br />opening with a liberal, female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene which prompts the famous, "go ahead, make my day" line), "sudden impact" is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film. the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. it gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past. superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the '80's.
