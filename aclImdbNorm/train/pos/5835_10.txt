stan & ollie become saps at sea when their wayward little boat is commandeered by a vicious murderer.<br /><br />the boys are wonderful in this feature, which starts out with one of their most hilarious set pieces, the horn factory. always a few steps out of sync with the rest of creation, laurel & hardy inhabit a world where icy radios & bedded billy goats are the rule, not the exception. with its brief length, the film is more in style with their classic short subjects, which explains its episodic nature.<br /><br />only the boys get screen credit, but movie mavens will recognize other familiar faces: james finlayson appears as a loony doctor, richard cramer does full justice to his bad guy role, sweet mary gordon plays the boys' perplexed neighbor. that's charlie hall as the apartment house desk clerk and silent screen comic ben turpin portrays a most peculiar plumber.<br /><br />one of the film's script writers was silent comedian harry langdon.<br /><br />stan & ollie are the main focus, however. watching hardy go berserk at the sound of a horn, or laurel's antics with bananas, for instance, reminds the viewer why these fellows remain absolute cinematic giants.
