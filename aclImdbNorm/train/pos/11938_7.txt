i enjoy movies like this for their spirit, no pun intended. its a decent, clean movie about a baseball team that's falling behind, and a young fan wishes for them to win, since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he'd come back for him. <br /><br />the spirit shines through in two ways: a funny cast with danny glover and a young joseph gordon-levitt, and the heavenly herald al, taking the dynamic form of christopher lloyd. its an energetic movie. it gets you smiling, and really involves you in the sport. <br /><br />therein lies my gripe. the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team. there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. i just find it odd that i should come away from the movie thinking the angels are a strong, cool team, when really my base loyalty, such as it is, lies with the toronto blue jays. it's interesting, really. if it's just a movie about an underdog kids team, then its okay.
