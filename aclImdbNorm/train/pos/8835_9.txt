a sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is. the annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels. it isn't supposed to but it does. this tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 communist belgrade is a heart warmer. it is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema. obviously, 1953 belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the communist society is often portrayed. one can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is the song "hey babu riba" ala the title of the movie. but jeans cannot be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess. unlike a heavy-handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four. the girl who has a father in exile in italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him, the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys, the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it. the boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has stalin tattooed on his hands. these all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away, as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the soviet empire. a great movie worth seeing again and again.
