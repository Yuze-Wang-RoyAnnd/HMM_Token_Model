- having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of new york city, jim blandings (cary grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children. he's hoping to find the simple life. but, building a house proves to be anything but simple. as the headaches and the bills start piling up, so do the laughs. will mr. blanding's ever get his dream house? <br /><br />- what makes this movie so special is the three main actors - grant, myrna loy, and melvyn douglas. any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role. he is so good at playing the put upon husband. loy is a always a joy to watch. the thin man films she made with william powell are near perfect. and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years. douglas also appeared in the old dark house, a particular favorite of mine.<br /><br />- the movie is definitely a product of its time. i get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story, three bedroom, four bathroom house on $15,000 income a year. throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live-in maid and it becomes almost fanciful.<br /><br />- however, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments the blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today. and that's where the comedy comes in. how many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected? - the biggest complaint i have about mr. blandings is the whole "wife in love with best friend" subplot. it's really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented.
