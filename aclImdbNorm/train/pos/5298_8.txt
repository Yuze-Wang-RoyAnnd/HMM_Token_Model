john waters has given us a genuinely enjoyable film. this certainly isn't without its shocking waters-esque moments, but it is tamer than his older culty stuff, such as "pink flamingoes". "pecker" harkens back to john's early mainstream stage in that it reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in "polyester". overall, a really fun comedy with some great moments!
