christopher smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick 'creep'. 'creep' although a little bit loose on information, proves itself worthy of a true gory classic. a little less glossy than recent us horrors (amityville horror remake, house of wax remake) this dark and gruesome tale follows kate (franka potente) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she, and a number of others along the way, try and flee a murderous attacker. though some bad reviews have slated this film, i truly believe that on a tight budget and for a uk production from first time director smith that 'creep' truly does live up to its name. it delivers fast-paced gory action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast as the story is patchy in some areas, but with a perfect location and the best character-reaction-at-the-end i've seen in a while, 'creep' delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares.
