this is a movie i had never even thought of seeing until my 3 year old spotted it at the video store and grabbed it after liking the cover picture of the animals on nabooboo island. we got it and have watched it repeatedly since; in fact we've rented it several times since. there are very few non-animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to; what a nice change from dumbo and the little mermaid. the acting is outstanding, the songs are compelling, they get deep into your head and you can't help but singing along. the storyline, while specifically about ww2 is timeless in it's own way and there is something new to see every time you watch. i've heard it compared to mary poppins, but i think they are two very different movies, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest at all in mary poppins. this is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and one that parents won't mind complying with. there are days we watch it before nap time and bed time and i don't feel that groan coming that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie.
