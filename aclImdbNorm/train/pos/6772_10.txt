unlike another user who said this movie sucked (and that olivia hussey was terrible), i disagree.<br /><br />this movie was amazing!!!!!! olivia hussey is awesome in everything she's in! yeah she may be older now, because many remember her from romeo and juliet, but she's wonderful! <br /><br />this story line may be used quite often, but it's a unique movie and i'll fight back on anyone who disagrees! i enjoyed this movie just as much as i have any other olivia hussey movie. olivia's "my girl" and i love her work.<br /><br />i saw this for the first time on saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with it. not only because's it's an olivia movie, but because of it's unique story line and wonderful direction.
