this movie changed it all for me...i heard of breakdancing and hiphop, but had never seen it professionally done (hey i was an 11-year old kid from holland!) when i saw this movie, this all changed. i got actively involved in the hiphop-movement in our city, started breakdancing and writing lyrics.<br /><br />to this day, i still consider this movie to be a personal favorite. sure, the filming and "cinematographic" importance might not be that significant. but who cares if the wide-shot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody? it's what it does to you personally that counts...
