a bug's life is a very good animated feature. this movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. the story is about an ant named flik. he brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. he gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. this movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a pixar movie. the animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. the story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. the voice acting is good as with most animation movies. the music is nice to listen to. nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. this is a good movie for all families. i rate this movie 10/10.
