other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film. that's simply not true and a little unfair.<br /><br />the acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity. i don't think there's anything wrong with the tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together. perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try. i thought it made the film much more interesting. perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening, but that's about the only fault i can find. nestor cantillana gives a great performance as sylvio, also antonella rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone.
