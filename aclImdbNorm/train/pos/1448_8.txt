across the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any kind of political ambition, should take time out to see this film. the movie is called " city hall " and with little imagination, its synopsis can take place anywhere in america. it just so happens to open in new york. here we have the story of a popular politician named mayor john pappas (al pacino) with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort. his right-hand man is none other than deputy mayor kevin calhoun (john cusack) an equally bright individual who's ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office. everything points in that direction, until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by marybeth cogan (bridget fonda) who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor. a six year old boy and a police officer's death are blamed on a career criminal who's questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up by political pay-offs and city corruption involving union leaders like danny aiello played by frank anselmo, corrupt judicial officials like judge walter stern. (martin landau) and mafia bosses like paul zapatti (anthony franciosa) who are deeply involved. also implicated, are party officials like larry schwartz (richard schiff) who works for the probation office of new york. but it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting. a great vehicle for cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. ****
