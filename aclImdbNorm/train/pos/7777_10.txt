rich, alcoholic robert stack falls in love with secretary lauren bacall. he marries her and is so happy he stops drinking. however, bacall is secretly loved by stacks' best friend, rock hudson. and stacks' nymphomaniac sister, dorothy malone, lusts after rock. throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control (in a good way).<br /><br />very glossy movie in beautiful technicolor with jaw-dropping fashions and furnishings (check out bacall's hotel room at the beginning). everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful, form-fitting clothes. basically this is a soap opera with grade a production values. the story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top. the acting by hudson, stack and bacall isn't that good, but seeing them so young and glamorous is great...especially stack...when he smiled my knees went weak! dorothy malone, on the other hand, is fantastic--she deservedly won best supporting actress for her role. she's sexy, violent, vicious and sympathetic...all convincingly. <br /><br />fun, glossy trash. don't miss it!
