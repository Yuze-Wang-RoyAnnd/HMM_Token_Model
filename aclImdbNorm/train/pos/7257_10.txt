the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film. i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. because alan dobie was a friend of mine, i got to hear about it. i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor. i asked peter collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it. i was told, too late. so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off. i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. then i was invited to see the finished film. i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on. it's a beautifully made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, i expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if i had it wouldn't be so good. i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? i would also love to see the film again, i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho.
