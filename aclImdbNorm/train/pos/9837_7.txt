zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making. firstly, it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2, with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a. romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi. confusing enough? basically, none of the films have anything to do with one another, but who cares when they make money. i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out. bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time.<br /><br />zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare. scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines, terrorists steal it unleashing a plague, and zombie run amok. the scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice. there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet. <br /><br />overall, i actually liked this film. i heard horrible things, but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable. the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution, corrupted military, man playing god, etc. i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film, but it veered off in a weird direction, presumably when mattei came on board.<br /><br />besides ripping off other zombie flicks, this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies. you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with, "when you see the men in white suits & gas masks, run to them for help." this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies. later, they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular, uncontaminated people is killed by mistake.<br /><br />the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner. how is it cool? let me count the ways
