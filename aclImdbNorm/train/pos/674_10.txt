while to most people watching the movie, this will be of little interest, but out of the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and the occult in one form or another, this one is probably the best in many ways.<br /><br />from the golem to the craft the subject seems to be of endless interest to the movie industry. the majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so childishly (for example "witchboard", a true piece of utter garbage in every way) either taking the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villians (cf "warlock"). more frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context (in the various revelations-oriented movies, the antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of new-age style practice). rarely, a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as allegorical and not literal, or symbolic, or ... just not quite right.<br /><br />i watched this movie again after many years tonight. i had seen it before on vhs; it is a dark, moody piece, and after watching it on dvd, i would say if you have any intention to watch this movie, watch it on dvd, don't watch it on vhs.<br /><br />the darkness and moodiness are overpowering in vhs but in dvd the movie takes on a very different tone. i think weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style, but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of vhs this goes over the edge. dvd brings the movie to life again and i saw it differently.<br /><br />anyway, seeing it as if for the first time, i realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie. it's difficult to go into all the reasons why, i don't care to take the time to do so.<br /><br />for anybody who's curious, anyway, if you want to see what it is like in real life, this movie is just very right on countless levels.<br /><br />and for anybody who isn't, you really wasted a lot of time reading to this point.
