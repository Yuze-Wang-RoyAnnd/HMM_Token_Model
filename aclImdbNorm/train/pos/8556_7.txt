this movie is plain fun.i has nothing to do with the original america pie, but it is fun to watch.<br /><br />another try, but better than band camp and the naked mile, at least funnier.<br /><br />just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out, so i decided to call my friend and we would watch it together.we had a few beers and we had fun.<br /><br />you will not find any deep message in this movie, but it's worth watching.<br /><br />so, lay back and just enjoy.
