i was living rawlins when this movie was made and i got lucky enough to be able to work on it. both as an extra and with eddie surkin on special effects. it was fun to see all the behind the scene workings, from the barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair up through the wardens office floor. also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors, from viggo to tiny. also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called "disney gate" by locals. if anybody is interested and is ever in rawlins, most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour. it was a lot of fun working for and with r. harlin and wished i had a chance to do it again.
