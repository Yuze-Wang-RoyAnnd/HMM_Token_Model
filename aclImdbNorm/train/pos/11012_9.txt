i wasn't sure at first if i was watching a documentary, propaganda film or dramatic presentation. i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three.<br /><br />admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on. we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment.<br /><br />where this movie came together for me was closer to the end. the scenes had a realism (at least as i perceived it) that i haven't encountered often before. you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants. this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarce.<br /><br />the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in 1943 as the war waged with japan. also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years.
