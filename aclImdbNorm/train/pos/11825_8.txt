don't look for an overdeveloped plotline here....just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one. a gallery of stars pop up as the classic cartoon character's villains in this live action comedy, which features incredible makeup and set design, not to mention knockout performances from beatty, madonna, and pacino. great fun for kids and adults alike.<br /><br />*** out of ****
