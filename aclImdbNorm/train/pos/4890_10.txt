superb cast, more please!<br /><br />if you can catch just about anything else written by plater (or starring these wonderful actors). for anyone who doesn't know plater has a real feeling for jazz, my recommendation is to see the 'beiderbecke' trilogy whenever you can.<br /><br />"there's three kinds of jazz - hot, cool and 'what time does the tune start?'"
