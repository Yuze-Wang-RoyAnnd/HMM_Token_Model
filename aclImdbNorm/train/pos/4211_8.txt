i watched this last night on tv (hbo). i have to admit, that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other fn era movies. i loved the way chip would be all calm one moment and then violent the very next moment. it was classic. ahh yes. the dames, the villians, the cigars and thuggish cops! it has it all. this movie delivered all the goods to me. i especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot, very common for this era of movie. very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days. i rate this movie one of the best i have seen in the fn genre!
