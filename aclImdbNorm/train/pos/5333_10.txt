how this has not become a cult film i do not know. i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy!<br /><br />"runaway car" attempts to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller, but taking the quality of acting (good god it's bad), the storyline, the practicalities of the car's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh. and laugh you will. films are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film's worth. this film is the pinnacle in entertainment, i laughed from beginning to end. at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked, it really is that funny at some points. when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn't rip the car roof to pieces, i was laughing hysterically. but when the baby starting swinging around in the air, nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree, tears were running down my face.<br /><br />it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna's "like a prayer" video. he seems to get everywhere.
