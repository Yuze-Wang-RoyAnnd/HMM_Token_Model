that's what t.v. should be. and pushing daisies lives up to those expectations. a beautifully crafted and well-designed show, pushing daisies is one of the few shows left on prime-time that has integrity, is good for the entire family and sparks your imagination. it's not about the normal action, sex, money or murder angles of every other show on t.v. it's a show that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic plot may seem impossible, the concepts are real to us all. wanting something you can't have, hoping for someone to want us, running away from your past and searching for family, even in the most unlikely of places, etc...<br /><br />i realize that abc has basically canceled this wonderful show at this point, and will most likely replace it with some show beyond the point of integrity. i suppose everything does come back to money... it's too bad that there are now no other shows on abc that actually make you feel good after watching.
