disregard the plot and enjoy fred astaire doing a foggy day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless joan fontaine. here we see astaire doing what are essentially "stage" dances in a purer form than in his films with ginger rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. best of all: the fact that we see burns and allen before their radio/tv husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their paramount college films from the 30s. (george was once a tap dance instructor). their two numbers with fred are high points of the film, and worth waiting for. the first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the "chin up" exhilarating carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. it almost seems spontaneous. fan of fred astaire and burns & allen will find it worth bearing up under the "plot". i've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful.
