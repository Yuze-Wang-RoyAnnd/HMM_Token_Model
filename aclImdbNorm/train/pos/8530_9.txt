not sure why it doesn't play in peoria, apparently, but this is a very funny, clever british comedy. it's set at the end of the "swinging sixties". peter sellars is fantastic as the rich, forty-something serial womaniser. the perfectly delectable goldie hawn, playing a 19 year american girl in london, is, initially, sellars' "catch of the day". but the urbane tv food critic can't stop himself from falling for the dizzy american blond.<br /><br />humour, pathos, great script, strong performances from the leads and supporting caste.<br /><br />it's a great film, and the best gag is the very last line.<br /><br />try it, you'll like it.
