the cameraman's revenge is an unusual short not because of the subject matter (adultery) or because it's animated (winsor mccay had introduced little nemo on film by this time) but because it depicts bugs to tell the story! ladislaw starewicz had originally wanted to film actual bugs fighting but couldn't get them to do it on camera because of the hot lights they suffered through so he took dead ones and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction. this short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures such as riding motorcycles, painting, filming, kissing, and dancing. starewicz would also make frogland (1922) and the mascot (1933) but his first notable work would be this one. if you're interested in this and the other shorts mentioned, check your local library to borrow the dvd the cameraman't revenge and other fantastic tales from image entertainment.
