trey parker and matt stone, the creators of the show 'south park' , return with something entirely different.they create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball.this sport is known as baseketball.it's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and there's another letter e in the title.here's how you play: you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot.sounds simple.in fact, i might try it one day.after the game hits the streets, it soon becomes a huge success.who would've known that 2 immature friends could invent a sport that became so successful?<br /><br />my opinion<br /><br />'baseketball' is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lots of slapstick violence, yet it actually delivers some laughs and plenty of entertainment.a definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor.
