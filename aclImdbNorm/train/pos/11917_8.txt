yeah, the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie. the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it. that's just brilliant. joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. the way he interacts with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating. a very nice family movie with - i concede - a rather corny happy end. but hey, it doesn't really matter, the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes.
