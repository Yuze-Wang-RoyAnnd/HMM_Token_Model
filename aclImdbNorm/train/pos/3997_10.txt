what a moving film. i have a dear friend who is in her sixties and for the past 15 years has told me that people don't see her anymore, and she longs for companionship. being in my late 40s i am beginning to see what she has been complaining about. you are no longer youthful, beautiful or touchable. when may says "...this lump of a body..." wow. how our bodies change and how we are told it is no longer beautiful. i love when she begins to change what she wears...the colorful scarf...no longer the frumpy wife.<br /><br />it is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. sad in that may betrays her daughter's trust...beautiful in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the affair, and chooses to move on and finally have her own life. i love the character's daring to even initiate the love affair.<br /><br />mostly i love the movie because finally it is a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships, be they familial or not. we see paula's vulnerability, yet she will have what she wants at all costs...(when she tells her mum that she will have a baby for darren whether he wants one or not after her mother asks if darren even wants a child). the movie hits the mark on the how relationships can change, and yet reveals what has been there all along, dormant. may has stifled her own creativity to raise a family. a family that she didn't really want, but was "something you just did when she was young". i love the scene when darren calls her an old tart, and she smiles and says "i was never called that before". it was truly a gem of a movie.<br /><br />and daniel craig. well, i just love him. i was pleasantly surprised. not only is he pleasant on the eyes, he is a real talent. what a neat role. he is much more than any 007 that is for sure and i look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature. the scene where he is pleasuring may and the look he gives her is sort of a look of wonder that he has such control over this woman, and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her. he is actually enjoying giving her pleasure. a wonderful scene. the contrast is the love scene with bruce. bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure...two completely different men.<br /><br />alas...i wonder where is my darren?
