g'omez pereira is the responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of latest spanish cinema (just take a look at his curriculum vitae), so i didn't expect that much of "cosas que hacen..."... in fact i don't know why in the world did i decide to watch it. anyway, i just did... and what a surprise. it looks that g'omez pereira has finally matured and now he's capable of making a good movie. he's last work deals with the midlife crisis, the disappointing, and the seeking for a second chance after you've ruined it all. the last half hour of the movie (the more dramatic) is the best part, and it just makes worth watching the film. also we have eduard fernandez playing the main role, and i keep on thinking he's the best actor of his generation (by far).<br /><br />*my rate: 7/10
