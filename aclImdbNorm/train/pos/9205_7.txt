this one grew on me. i love the r.d. burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story i found much to be moved by as i kept re-watching the movie. the brother-sister plot line is powerful, i thought; there's also more probably obligatory stuff, like bar fights, a loony crime story, etc. that are just distracting. (though not unfunny from a certain point of view.) also the english translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch, and as loony as it is i am grateful to him for doing it.<br /><br />like many of the bollywood movies i've seen, this one is melodramatic and opera-like, including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister, and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to kathmandu seeking to re-connect with this girl, grown up and troubled (she had been told her brother and mother were dead), numbing her pain with drugs.<br /><br />a super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement, which brought hordes of seekers to india, from an indian point of view, that sees them as people driven to india by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies, but nonetheless, in india, living only for the pleasures of the moment. the hippie singing-dancing-drugging scenes are truly wonderful, and accurate in their tone (i'm old enough to remember), and i feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zoned-out kids are actual hippie extras, as i remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the east getting this kind of work in bollywood.<br /><br />(it is not about the actual hare krishna movement, though the movie hippies sing a krishna/rama chant, as do a group of actual indian devotees, unrelated to the hippies, in the opening scene of the movie.)<br /><br />~virginia
