this movie is a perfect example of a film that divides people into 2 groups.. those who get the joke and those who don't. people usually attack what they don't understand. this film has a comic style and charm that has been unparalleled since. it's a great comedy.. and a great romance. it's a perfect date movie. a perfect movie for someone who wants a good lighthearted laugh. and if your perspective is too tense, maybe this movie isn't for you, and you may need counseling. it is an injustice that paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 80's, having never seen the light of day on dvd. yet they feel an urban version of "the honeymooners" is a good idea. i find it odd that my two alltime favorite romantic comedies have never been released on dvd. the other being gene wilder's "the world's greatest lover" which fox has sat on since the early 80's as well... yet, "from justin to kelly" is in nearly every video store in the country. there is no justice in the world. maybe those who took the time to bash this will enjoy "from justin to kelly", i'm sure that one is watered enough for them to "get". sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor... or sometimes it just goes stale and they find comic satisfaction in reruns of "full house".
