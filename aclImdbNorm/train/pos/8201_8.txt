sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director. the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support. in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film. one might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it's a film about guilt, justice and retribution. for me, at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy. however, in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film. forget the "go ahead punk, make my day scene", that's iconic but not original. but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air, zooming in on the city. the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital. eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director. and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology. also, i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed. although eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see play misty for me, breezy etc.) thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story. the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog.
