i think that that creator(s) of this film's concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received. it isn't an oscar caliber film of course, but, at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in 1984 (in the theatre). <br /><br />i don't think this is (and hope it isn't) a spoiler, but: imagine acting on your impulses. doing the first thought that pops into your head, saying the first words on your lips... no restraint, no conscious, nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that, as intelligent adults, we know we shouldn't actually say or do. if anything, this film only scratches the surface - it doesn't go as far as it could go. <br /><br />in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older "classics" to try and cash in on today, wouldn't it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success, for the sake of taking it to the next level? a bit further, or even to explore what the original crew didn't, wouldn't or couldn't deal with 20 years ago? <br /><br />that's just my opinion anyway. :o)
