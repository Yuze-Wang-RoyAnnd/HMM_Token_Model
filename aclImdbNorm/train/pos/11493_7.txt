the unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy. it's very well acted by the always-good brooke adams and b-movie stalwart james karen, although the supporting cast is pretty average for a b-grader. the music, by gary numan of all people, is good too. henry dominic's script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. rodman fender's direction is merely adequate, and there are some unnecessary cheap scares. if you're a fan of adams, whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be, check it out; she's great, as always.
