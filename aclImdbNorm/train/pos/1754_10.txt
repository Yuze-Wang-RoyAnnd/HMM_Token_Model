this movie starts out hilarious from about the 15 second mark, and continues it throughout the movie. i cannot recall a scene where i didn't turn to look at people laughing with me. he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressed.<br /><br />the comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular. as you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated 7.9 on imdb. i think it should be in 250. lets put it this way i haven't seen this funny of a movie since american pie or the original vacation. see it if you want a laugh. i give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about imdb, great movie site.
