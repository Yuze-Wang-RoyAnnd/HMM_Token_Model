if you loved deep cover, you might like this film as well. many of the poetic interludes fishburne recites in deep cover are from the lyrical script of "once in the life," a screen adaptation of a play that fishburne wrote. if you love larry as much as i do, you'll love this film that is all larry, all hot, and all fleshed out. of course there is gun play and illicit substance use, this is a gangster movie of sorts, after all, but the script is beautiful and the story is touching, even a little on the chick flick side.<br /><br />amazing film...dark, frightening, sexy, and exciting. if you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse, you'll get the proper impact of the cramped sets (metephorically echoing being trapped in the life). full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships, this film is tight..every sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots. good work!
