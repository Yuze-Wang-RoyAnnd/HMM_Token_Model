it's a bit easy. that's about it.<br /><br />the graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgiveable. the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games. the sounds are magnificant. everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic.<br /><br />the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like banjo-kazooie and donkey kong 64.<br /><br />i got this game as a christmas present in 1997, and since then, i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.
