this film is like a 1950-version of ettore scola's brutti sporchi e cattivi. less sex and less realism, but a tale with great humanism and warmth. i wouldn't call this a neo-realistic picture. it's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and should probably be classed as a comedy, although it deals with serious matters (a little like chaplin or 1930-comedy). typical italian though, very emotional, and hard to resist except for a stone cold person. the sentimentalism is a letdown, although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama. it's not a masterpiece like umberto d or the bicycle thief. but it is a lovable and hilarious comedy, with good music.<br /><br />7/10
