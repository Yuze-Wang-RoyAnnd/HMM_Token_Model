i love bad movies. not only, because they often are as entertaining as 'really' 'good' films (like pirates of the caribbean series and other hollywood pathos), but they often are far better than those films. and that's the reason why i love italian rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s. and that's the reason why i especially love this movie, the barbarians & the company.<br /><br />director ruggero deodato has made some actually very good movies, like house on the edge of the park, and also his atlantis interceptors and live like a cop, die like a man are enjoyable action movies. but this is really bad. the barbarians is so idiotic movie. peter and david paul as the barbarian brothers kutchek and gore are very funny, because of their lack of charisma and acting skills. but if they can't act, they yell and scream every time they do something important. in one scene people try to hang the barbarian brothers, and they escape very extraordinary way.<br /><br />bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, actually everything is bad in this movie. i can't describe how much i laughed when i watched this first time. the barbarians & the company is camp classic everybody should see once. if you thought plan 9 from outer space is fun camp, this will be a real killer.
