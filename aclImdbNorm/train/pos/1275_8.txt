i found this movie to be charming. i thought the characters were developed since as i watched, i found myself caring about these people. this is a period piece that i believe took place during the depression. a single mother, who is known as the town recluse (she has reason to be), puts an ad in the paper for "a husband". christopher reeve plays a ex-con who happens into town looking for work. he sees the ad and he goes out to see her. she hires him. i really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because i found it easy to put myself in their shoes. everything went on so matter of fact. he needs the work so he doesn't want to upset her. and she needing his help, but doesn't want him to get the upper hand. they dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other. things start warming up until ......the big blowup. i won't spoil it by telling you what happens. but the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful. i found the story to be very believable for the time it's taking place. i think this is one of the better "relationship" stories out there. maybe the younger generation won't "get it" but if you are over 40 i think you'll like it. and if you liked christopher reeve in "somewhere in time" you'll like him in this one also.
