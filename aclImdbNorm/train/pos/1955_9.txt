just the kind of movie i love. some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone. catherine tramell (stone) masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people's lives, playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book. she plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows. tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the 'never visit after dark' side of town. from the beginning, there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone. stone could also be described as a sort of female hannibal lecter, an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan.
