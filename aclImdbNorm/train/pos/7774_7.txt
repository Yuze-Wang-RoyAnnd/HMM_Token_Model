"written on the wind" was an enormously successful universal picture. it could only be done by douglas sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given. based on a popular novel by robert wilder and an adaptation by george zuckerman, it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama: nymphomania, a large oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a mild touch of homosexuality. mr. sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre, mainly, "dallas" and "dynasty", just to mention two.<br /><br />the fact is this movie was shot entirely inside a studio. most of the decor is phony. like a lot of those 1950s pictures, "written on the wind" was shot entirely in a studio lot. just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in manhattan, or miami, or even the lake are, one can see how the scenery is a painted backdrop. mr. sirk couldn't care less about realism as long as he could tell the story his own way.<br /><br />we recently caught a screening, part of a revival of mr. sirk's work, where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes where rock hudson, who plays the good mitch wayne, appears. there is also something graphic in the way that both robert keith, who plays the patriarch jasper hadley, and later on his own daughter, the evil marylee, caress the oil derrick that adorns the elder man's desk, a sort of phallic object d'art.<br /><br />douglas sirk probably wanted his cast to give over the top performances, which makes sense in the way dorothy malone portrays the nymphomaniac marylee, and to a certain degree, robert stack, who overacts as kyle, the tormented heir of the story. that would probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen. the only one that seems normal is lauren bacall, who wasn't asked to make her lucy moore character appear to be anything but a grounded person caught hanging out with the wrong crowd.<br /><br />together with his other hollywood movies, "written on the wind" shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see: stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen
