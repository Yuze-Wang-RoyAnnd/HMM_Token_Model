star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits <br /><br />mike atherton (dudikoff) is peacefully making his way in the wild west when he spots a group of men mistreating a lady. being a gentleman, he naturally steps in and puts a stop to this and in doing so kills the son of a nasty enforcer. this is just the beginning of a all guns blazing battle to the finish from which there will be only one winner.<br /><br />m dudikoff is an action star who's never truly managed to take off with me. maybe i discovered him too late and after the other film i saw with him in it last monday, the human shield, it was just another dud (ha ha) added to the list. but i have a thing for westerns, being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and with this dudikoff has picked one of his better scripts, as his films go anyway.<br /><br />the film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain, sounding like a blank marlon brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast, along with the obligatory cheap looking sets. but if, for some strange reason, your life ever depended on watching a dudikoff film, this would be one of your best choices. ***
