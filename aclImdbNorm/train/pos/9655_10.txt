maybe "presque rien" is not the best movie ever made... but it is better than many of you have said. i still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one.<br /><br />you americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies, with a clear beginning, development and outcome. but european movies are less narrative, but makes you think much and feel.<br /><br />many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie.. the purpose of this one is not show us a simple "summer loving movie", with commercial characters who "fall in love and live happy forever". summer holidays and beach are only a background, and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys.<br /><br />maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie, because of its 3 parts, showed as flashbacks. these 3 moments are: - summertime in pornichet, when they meet and love. - after a year and half living together in nantes, mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself. he tries to suicide taking something, and cedric brings him to hospital. later, he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that. - the last part, is when mathieu come back to pornichet, in winter, alone.. to think about how his life have changed, how his life become to be, and trying to find himself.<br /><br />it's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed among them. but anyway, as i said before... this is not a funny movie. if what someone want to see is meat, for that, we have belami movies.<br /><br />presque rien, what want to show us, is how cruel can be the life, for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life. mathieu only wants to go away from home, and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness.. but what seemed perfect at the beginning.. later is not as good as he thought, and he become troubled, and feel that he has lost the way of his life. he is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. he finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /><br />so, funny? is not a funny movie. very hot scenes? only a few.. but this is not a movie for entertainment. is all about feelings... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness... i, as many others, feel identified with life and problems of mathieu, and that is what director wanted to do.. a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life.<br /><br />for me, the best homo-themed movie ever.
