what a gem of a movie, so good that they made a sequel.<br /><br />the film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other.<br /><br />bendan hughes plays the eccentric vlad, a bit of an inkling there to who this character is, who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house.<br /><br />hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format.<br /><br />the movie is watchable, but the actors' performances are very wooden and they seem as they don't want to be in this film, but may be that's just all part of the decadent ambiance.<br /><br />didn't like the ending, but there is a sequel, must track it down.<br /><br />when i watched the film i thought brendan hughes didn't really fit the part. later on, i couldn't stop thinking about him, he sort of exudes an eerie sensuality, so maybe he was right for the part.<br /><br />brendan hughes last seen in 'hitler - the rise of evil' as lt. guffman.<br /><br />where is he now?
