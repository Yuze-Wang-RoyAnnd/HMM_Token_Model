i grew up watching this movie ,and i still love it just as much today as when i was a kid. don't listen to the critic reviews. they are not accurate on this film.eddie murphy really shines in his roll.you can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it.i recommend this movie to everybody to see. it is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.with demons ,dragons,and a little bald kid with god like powers.this movie takes you from l.a. to tibet , of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in tibet.just a beautiful view! so go do your self a favor and snatch this one up! you wont regret it!
