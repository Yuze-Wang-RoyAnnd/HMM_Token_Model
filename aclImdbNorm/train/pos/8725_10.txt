i liked antz, but loved "a bug's life". the animation that was put into this paid off. i will definitely be getting this on dvd. by the way, disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (i heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format). most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest! i only saw one of the two sets, but i can't wat to see the other one!
