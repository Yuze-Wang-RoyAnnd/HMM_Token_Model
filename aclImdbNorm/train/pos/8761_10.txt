i love claire danes, and kate beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role. the movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some monastery, working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline. the acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed-to-be thailand is eye-catching, but claire daines steals the entire movie, and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end, in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world. the flaws are minute and i recommend the film, which seems buried sadly forever to rare tv showings. i for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only "10" rated films. watch it, you will be very touched.
