this is one of the most daring and important of the so-called "pre-code" films made in hollywood during the 1930s. unlike some pre-code films that occasionally dabbled in subjects that would have never been allowed after 1934-5, this film fully immersed itself in a very sordid yet entertaining plot from start to finish. the conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely not evident in this film, as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top--and with no apologies along the way. this "broad" both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich--something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later.<br /><br />the film begins with barbara stanwyck working in her father's speakeasy. in addition to being her boss, he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he'll allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity. while not especially clear here, it appears as if daddy has been "renting" his daughter's body out for a long time.<br /><br />however, after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull, barbara has had enough and heads to the big city. it doesn't hurt that the still blew up and killed her father, but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move.<br /><br />despite the depression, barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega-bank. she starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk, but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks, she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another--until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son-in-law!!! this all ends in tragedy, but babs doesn't seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men. in fact, some time later, she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the new ceo and once again she's on top (perhaps in more way than one).<br /><br />now so far, this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant. barbara played a 100% sociopath--a woman with no morality and no conscience--just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process. however, the brave writers and producer "chickened out" and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending. considering that this woman was so evil and conniving, her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film. in many ways, this reminded me of the ending of jezebel--as once again, a wicked person somehow "sees the light" and changes at the not-too-convincing conclusion.<br /><br />my advice is to try watching red-headed woman and downstairs. red-headed woman is much like baby face but features no magical transformation at the end--the leading lady really is a skunk down deep! in downstairs, a film very much like red-headed woman, the roles are reversed and a man (john gilbert) plays a similar conniving character. both are classics and a bit better than this film.<br /><br />this film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra-sleazy hollywood films and in this light it's well worth seeing for cinephiles. also, fans of the duke take note--john wayne plays a very small part in the film and it's very unusual to see a very young wayne playing such a conventional role.
