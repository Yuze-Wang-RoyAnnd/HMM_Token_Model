i looked at this movie with my child eyes, and i wasn't disappointed. the story is well-known, some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal)... and i don't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut. this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture.<br /><br />briefly : it works, it is funny and it is a "must-see" with your children (they'll like it).
