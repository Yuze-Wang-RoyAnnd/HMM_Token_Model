like his early masterpiece "the elephant man" lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight, simple story without losing his artistic touch. this is a true story of an elderly retired man (expertly played by richard farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at death's door. a beautiful score from badalamenti, exquisite photography of rural life (love those aerial corn-field shots), and a sly director's hand that reveals man's basic humanity, this is a beautiful slice of life film. its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep, but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end.
