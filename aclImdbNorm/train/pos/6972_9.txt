the caprica episode (s01e01) is well done as a pilot. really, this episode is the exact same content as the dvd pilot release. that having been said, episode 01 gives a very substantive background of the very popular "battlestar galactica" series (both the original and the 2007 remake). it significantly applies most to the 2007 series. as is the trending plots of sci-fi of late, this series explores "virtual" life or environment. on top of this, we are given much background on the adama family line as well as their relationship with the unrevealed (in the battlestar galactica series) creator of the cylons. to the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular topic of "virtual" life and (as is expected) early life of the colonies, and the birth of the cylons. <br /><br />over all, i rather enjoyed this episode. although, it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the dvd release of the caprica pilot, the series seems very promising. as is the case with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a cliff-hanger so to ensure a follow by an audience (sci-fi community). i'm definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development. <br /><br />i give this series 8 stars.
