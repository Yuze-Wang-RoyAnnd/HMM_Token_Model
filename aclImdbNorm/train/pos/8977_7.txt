as a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a variety show! i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard (captain midnight) webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event. what surprised me was the stunning performance of doris day. outside of 'calamity jane', i've never seen her put over a song better than she does here. randolph scott is memorable as well, even if he doesn't see much screen time. it's been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure humphrey bogart put in an appearance. with so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. if it ever turns up on a tv station near you, be sure to catch the doris day sequence, if nothing else!<br /><br />
