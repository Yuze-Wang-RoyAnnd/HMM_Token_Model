this movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen, but it's got quite a bit of quality. it's pretty lifelike, yet you think "it's only a movie." duvall and close portray common people, and you'd never even realize they are now big-name actors. it seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing eugene's girlfriend, but i guess it's possible. it seems unlikely that the kid would travel from montana to nevada by himself, but i guess it's possible. you might think that the family troubles in this movie would never happen in your own family, but i guess it's possible. i remember glenn close saying something like "you think the work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it isn't."
