in my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic disney masterpiece. if you ask me, the stepmother (voice of lucille la verne) was truly diabolical. you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. on the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping, cinderella (voice of ilene stanley) was a very beautiful lady. to me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. now, in conclusion, i highly recommend this absolutely romantic disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. you're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
