this movie feels like a film project. as though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work. characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though. despite this amateurish feel, the movie is effective. it's like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings. being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality. this provides for some predictable but well done conflict. probably most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings. a good watch but nothing stirring....
