a rousing adventure form director george stevens (before he would turn to more serious fare such as 1948's i remember mama and 1956's giant) that set the standard for all future action yarns to follow. loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem of the same, gunga din follows the journey of three military officers in 19th century india. the noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold. their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades, and have lent inspiration to nearly everything from the cliffhanger-inspired space opera star wars (1977) to the similarly-plotted raiders of the lost arc (1981).<br /><br />the biggest reason for the picture's success, however, is the pitch-perfect performances by the film's trio of extremely charismatic actors. victor mclaglen has rarely been better as the strapping tough guy, cary grant is the ultimate comic foil, and douglas fairbanks, jr is as suave a swashbuckling hero as imaginable - perhaps even more so than rival errol flynn. the chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved upon, and such warm and believable comradely is precisely what's missing from most modern action pictures - and they receive tremendous support from the marvelous sam jaffe, who overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title character a beacon of humane sweetness and quiet strength. a huge hit in its day (the film was reportedly the second-biggest money maker of 1939 behind the outrageously successful gone with the wind), and it remains arguably the best film of its kind.
