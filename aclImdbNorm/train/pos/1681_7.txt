"the case of the scorpion's tail" has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie. the story is standard giallo. when a man dies in a plane crash his wife (ida galli) collects a $1 million life insurance policy. the widow heads to greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her. there are plenty of suspects, including a tenacious investigator (george hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover. director martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. anita strindberg (also memorable in "your vice is a locked room and only i have the key" and "who saw her die?") is a stunning-looking heroine. it's one of martino's best films.
