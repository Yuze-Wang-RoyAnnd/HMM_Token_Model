earth (2009) ***1/2 big screen adaptation of the bbc/discovery channel series "planet earth" offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw-dropping moments of "how the hell did they get this footage?!" while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel (witness a great white shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal!) and adorable (the various babies and their 'rents). the basso profundo tones of narrator james earl jones solidifies its 'god's eye views' and profundity. culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage, the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the imax format and could've even gone longer! oh, well, there's always the next time (since disney studios has produced this count on a series of more to come). dirs: alastair fothergill & mark linfield.
