this is one of the great movies of the 80s in my collection that i think about all the time. <br /><br />the running man is one of arnold`s best and most different films even to this day and when i first saw the running man i was so excited to see a movie like this. i just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie. it also has jesse ventura, the legendary professor toru tanaka, sven-ole thorsen, the beautiful maria conchita alonso, yaphet kotto, kurt fuller, richard dawson, and thomas rosales jr. who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as universal solder, the lost world, robo cop 2, predator 2, and among others. all arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed, star filled, and its one its one of arnold`s best to date!
