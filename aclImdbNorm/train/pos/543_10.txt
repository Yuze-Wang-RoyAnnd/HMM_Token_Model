this movie is the best horror movie, bar-none.i love how stanley just dumps the women into the lake.i have been a fan of judd nelson's work for many years, and he blew me away. its a blend of horror, and drama ,and romance, not so much comedy. his evil, yet charming look captured me right then and there. that look in his eyes, i will never forget. there's something about him, i cant describe.
