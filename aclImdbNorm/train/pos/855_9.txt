this film is fantastic. finally well-written characters you can love for all their good and bad. pierce brosnan is flat-out hysterical in this self-effacing role. i think its the best thing he's ever done. he's done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fully-fledged work, but this role finally gave him the room to run with it. i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots. and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too, as well as actors to aspire too. kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying. you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back.
