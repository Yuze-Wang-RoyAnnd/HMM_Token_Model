i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster. i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family.<br /><br />i found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions.<br /><br />the scary monster although probably not scary to most adults, has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create.<br /><br />i found the film to be delightful!
