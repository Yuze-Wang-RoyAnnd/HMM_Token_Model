before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. after watching it, i realized how sad lucille ball's life really was. it had it's great moments too, but i didn't realize how sad it was. this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well. i highly reccommend it.
