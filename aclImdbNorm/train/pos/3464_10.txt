*warning* spoilers ahead... the writers of this story knew these men very well. the actors, likewise, portrayed them very well. the result is that by the end of the film you feel like you're actually watching john lennon and paul mccartney. the expected tensions are there, especially in the awkward first moments. but as the two begin to loosen up, the old camaraderie that made the beatles work so well begins to show through. the bitterness is still there, and interrupts at times, but by the time john gets the idea to take lorne michaels up on his offer to pay the beatles the gag sum of $3000 to appear on "saturday night live", the two could be the same boyish pranksters that terrorized liverpool together as teens, and survived playing the rough nightclubs of hamburg to rise to superstardom. but in the end, this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently. we are reminded why a beatles reunion was most likely never possible even before lennon's assassination: the two driving forces of the group outgrew each other.
