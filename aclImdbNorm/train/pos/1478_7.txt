i liked this movie, although halfway through it, i was able to tell who the secret admirer was.<br /><br />i am also wondering if it was based on a true story since it told about the "real" people at the end of the movie. i guess i will have to research it and let ya know.<br /><br />does anyone remember what state this happened in? i believe they moved to north carolina if i'm not mistaken.<br /><br />of course the states could have been changed to protect the innocent.<br /><br />you would think that this man could have figured it out as easily as i did. was he stupid or what?
