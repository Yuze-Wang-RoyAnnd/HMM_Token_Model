this is the second eytan fox film i have seen. the fantastic actor, lior ashkenazi, who starred in walk on water, has a minor role in this film also.<br /><br />but the real stars are the young israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - noam (ohad knoller), lulu (daniela virtzer), and yelli (alon friedman); and the palestinian that joins them off and on - ashraf (yousef 'joe' sweid). there is sort of a friends/sex in the city thing going on (mostly gay), and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace.<br /><br />but, that's the rub. no matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have, the war is not going to end. many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table, but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason. there are many on the israeli side, both there and here in the us, who just want it all and will not consider peace. there are many on the palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come. it is in no one's interest to end this war, and the children suffer.<br /><br />this is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film. it won't go away. you know something tragic is going to happen and, of course, it does. with the feelings on both sides running strong, and revenge as the motivator, tragedy always happens, and that is what makes this an adult version of friends/sex in the city. there is no superficiality. it is real life, and it was a beautiful thing to see.
