my main problem with the film is that it goes on too long. other then that, it's pretty good. paul muni plays a poor chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage. luise rainer is a servant girl who gets married to muni. they live with muni's father on a farm and they are doing pretty bad. when he finally gets some money to buy some more land, a drought hits and nothing is growing. everybody stars to head north by muni stays behind at first. when they leave and arrive at town they find that their are no jobs and they are worse off than before. they even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money but decide against it. when a bunch of people start looting the town, the military show up and start executing people . paul muni does a good job and luise rainer won a second oscar for this movie.
