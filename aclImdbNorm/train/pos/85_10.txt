i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975, when it was shown in combination with the red balloon. both films are similar in their dream-like quality. the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner, a little boy, is away at school. a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are, and begins to warily stalk his "prey." the boy begins his walk home from school, and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend. the fish becomes agitated by the cat's presence, and finally jumps out of the bowl! the cat quickly walks over to the fish, gently picks him up with his paws, and returns him to his bowl. the boy returns happily to his fish, none the wiser.<br /><br />the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity. it is hard to imagine how the director could've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 -- it seems more a trick for 2003.<br /><br />if you can find it, watch it -- you won't be disappointed! and if you *do* find it, let me know so i can get a copy, too!
