this movie surprised me in a good way. from the box i got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller, even though it was somewhat exciting.<br /><br />there's a lot of nice one-liners and funny situations in this movie and james belushi was born to do bill manucci, he does a great job. the rest of the cast ain't half-bad either and especially timothy dalton is a treat.<br /><br />the story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film. things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things. if you don't pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but i really liked it.<br /><br />louis morneau isn't all that well known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i never really grew impatient while watching the movie.<br /><br />made men is well worth checking out.
