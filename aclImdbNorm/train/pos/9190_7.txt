with the badly injured tony in an induced coma, two things happen: tony imagines himself leading the life of a salesman attending a business convention, while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the big man. the dream sequences are right out of an old twilight zone episode, as tony finds himself transformed into an average joe trying to deal with a missing wallet and mixed-up identities while on a cross-country business trip. his intonation as a blazer- and khaki-wearing schnook is more mid-american and less that of an italian thug from noo joisey. a nice touch. the shockingly long-haired, hippy-dippy aj (whom paulie calls "van helsing" at one point) has a nice scene with his comatose old man. the best moment has the big boys trying to talk about life without tony, which immediately breaks down into a territorial dispute. vito gets off a line about the new-dead gene possibly having been a closet case, which is interesting in light of what we are about to learn about vito.
