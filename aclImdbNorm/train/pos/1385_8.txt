i saw it at cinema mk2 hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in paris. a very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers, all of them just at about the same psychologically stages. many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age & our first feelings about sexual relations. it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism, but even in that case she doesn't corrupt the likelihood of the story. you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere. i fund the young actresses of talent, special mention with floriane and marie, very convincing. there are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is: impressing!
