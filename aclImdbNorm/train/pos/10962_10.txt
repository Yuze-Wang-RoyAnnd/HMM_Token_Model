it's interesting how the train of research can flow. i started out looking at an article about cristo's "the gates" in central park. the article stated that the maysles had been cristo's filmographers for years. hmmm... then i got to looking at their body of work. i believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming cristo and jean claude in their stages of creation. grey gardens sounded very interesting. video station, in boulder co, is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock. dvd and vhs. edith and edie are women living in the past, and oh what a glorious past it was. edith had been well off, born a bouvier, married well, had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties. her daughter edie had been a d'ebutante, a fashion model and had many beaus. she never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate. she seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind. worrying too much about things. it is only a shadow of the world they live in though, because jackie o. came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted. it is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out. but, in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls. if you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess. the outfits edie comes up with a very clever and creative. the viewer gets the impression that edith likes to go nude, but she doesn't in the movie. edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings "tea for two". edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56. it was a good movie, though not for everyone. when the cat is urinating behind edith's portait she states, " at least someone is doing what they want"!
