long before "brokeback mountain" (about 23 years before), "deathtrap" was the first time i ever saw two men passionately kissing on screen, and frankly, i was shocked. i understood it in terms of the plot, and it didn't really upset my sensibilities (not much), but it was the first time i ever saw it, at least, in a "mainstream" movie. i thought it was a gutsy move for its time, and took courage for them to try it, especially christopher reeve, in the midst of his time as pg-rated superman. male bisexuality on screen may have hit its stride with "brokeback," but it's interesting to note this much-earlier incarnation.
