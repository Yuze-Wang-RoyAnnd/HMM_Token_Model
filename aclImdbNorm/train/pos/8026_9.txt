throughout this film, you might think this film is just for kids. well, it is mainly pointed towards them, but it's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience. this time around, the muppet gang try to get on broadway, with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced, leading them to splitting up. but kermit won't stop, and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia! <br /><br />it's a send-up, in part, of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical, only here there's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments (lou zealand's boomerang fish; gonzo's water-stunt display, the whisper campaign, among many others), but also with a lot of heart too. the muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream. <br /><br />while not as totally original in scope as the muppet movie, it's got many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations all over manhattan, and even some intonations of inter-species dating (and marriage)! cameos include liza minneli ("a frog?"), elliot gould (as the cop), brooke shields (propositioned by a rat), edward i. koch, gregory hines and joan rivers. so get ready to sing-along, or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best muppet movies.
