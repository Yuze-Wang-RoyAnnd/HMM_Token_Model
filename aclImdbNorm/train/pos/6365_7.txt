this highly derivative film will be entertaining for the many who have not seen some of the more obscure anime films. i enjoyed most of it, especially after the rather flat opening minutes in the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very entertaining and includes some of the better bits of animation). james garner as the commander and leonard nimoy as the king give impressive performances.
