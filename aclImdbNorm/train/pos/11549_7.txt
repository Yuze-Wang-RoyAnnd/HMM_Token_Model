there's nothing really to dislike about "the odd couple," and it's no surprise that jack lemmon and walter matthau make a hugely winning comedic team. but there's something so underdeveloped about neil simon's adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full-bodied film. i have not seen the play, but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful, since simon wrote it, so the defects cannot be blamed on a stage-to-screen adaptation. there are some interesting ideas in this story--two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently--that simon never fully fleshes out. still, there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours.
