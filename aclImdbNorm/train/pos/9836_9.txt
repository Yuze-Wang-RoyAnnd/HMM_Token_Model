although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor (zombi 2) i actually like this one better. this is because of it's faster pace, better settings, and cool 80's soundtrack. it's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci. the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good. it was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness; for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas. some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror? there's even a flying zombie head! how rad is that? definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well. also check out zombi 4.
