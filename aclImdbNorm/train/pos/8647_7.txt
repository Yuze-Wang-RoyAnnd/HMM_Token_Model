if this is supposed to be a portrayal of the american serial killer, it comes across as decidedly average.<br /><br />a journalist [duchovny] travels across country to california to document america's most famous murderers, unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions [pitt] is a serial killer himself.<br /><br />rather predictable throughout, this has its moments of action and pitt and lewis portray their roles well, but i'd not bother to see it again.
