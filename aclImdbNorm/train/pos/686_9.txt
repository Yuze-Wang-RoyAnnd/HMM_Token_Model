ghost story (the tv movie--1972) was the pilot for the nbc series. the movie was well-written and well-acted and, i thought, when the 1972-73 tv season started, if the tv series is half as good as the movie, then nbc has a winner. (i wish this film was available on video!!) the series was a colossal disappointment--even with william castle as exec. producer. if, however,you have a chance to see the original tv movie, ghost story, check it out. you won't be disappointed.
