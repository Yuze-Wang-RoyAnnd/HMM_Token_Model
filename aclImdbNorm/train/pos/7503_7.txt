the film was okay, quite entertaining. the cast was pretty good, and i'll second what the comment before me mentioned - glenn quinn was outstanding and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. he played the selfish "evil" friend and manager of the band brilliantly!<br /><br />there are a lot of songs performed by "beyond gravity" in this film, but this doesn't really come as a surprise considering the film is a vh1 production. however, if the soft rock/ pop music isn't to someone's liking one might as well flash forward those scenes.<br /><br />the plot of a band trying to make it to the top in l.a. but having to overcome many obstacles on the way isn't too original, but quite entertaining, with some surprising plot turns here and there.
