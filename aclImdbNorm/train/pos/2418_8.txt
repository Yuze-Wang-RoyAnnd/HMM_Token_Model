one of john's funniest, eugene levy is great in this one as well, just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on dvd, i have it on video tape, but feel that this film deserves dvd (and extras would be great) the kung fu uuniversity (kung fu u) skit is so very funny, as is the entire film, also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great, this movie never seems to be on tv, but it loses most of it's hilarity when edited for broadcast tv, if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it (ebay is a good place to find a copy) i will keep my vhs until one day we get to see it on dvd. there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd, and this is one of them.
