im not a big tim matheson fan but i have to admit i liked this film.it was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy,i don't know were to classify this film its a bit sf and a bit horror slash thriller.i saw this at about 2.00am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it.if you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that bad,the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more better.i don,t know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for tv or went straight to video,i for one would buy this if it,s on dvd it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the x-files story attached to it.government undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealings.overall a good film.
