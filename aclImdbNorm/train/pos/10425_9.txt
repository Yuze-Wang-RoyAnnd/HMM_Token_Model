the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most "movergoers" were stay-at-homes watching their new 7" motorola televisions. almost all recent box office figures are false --- because they fail to adjust inflation. obviously today's $10 movies will dominate. in 1951 it cost 90c to $1.60 at radio city; 44c to 75c first run at loew's palace in washington dc, or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs. what counts is the number of people responding to the picture, not unadjusted box office "media spin." the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso (really not a great story anyway) and threw it in the trash. instead, 90% of the movie's focus was on the music. thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer enrico caruso. the result was a wonderful movie. too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating. too fat to play the student prince, edmund purdom took his place --- with lanza's voice dubbed in, and with the formerly handsome and not-fat lanza pictured in the advertising. if you want to see the great caruso, it's almost always on ebay for $2.00 or less. don't be put off by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.
