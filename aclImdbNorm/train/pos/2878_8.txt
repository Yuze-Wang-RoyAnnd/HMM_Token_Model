for quite a long time in my life, i either did not like this film, or i liked this film but not as much as many more. i watched it recently (at a sleepover, funnily enough) and i liked it more than i had done since i was under 6 or something. i now appreciate it more, as i do with a few other disney classics that i have watched recently (including "sleeping beauty" and "pinnochio" or however you spell it). <br /><br />i now very much appreciate the animation, the clever "disney" plot turns, the humour from the mice, the emotions expressed and the plot. the animation is very well done, often it seems you are wherever the other characters are, watching them. the animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds, including the town (which is shown twice briefly). disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, injecting clever plot turns ,such as the mice making the clothes and the key part (usually i do not like disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story, but with this i am not overly bothered. i feel they made necessary changes to make this a good disney film. often i do not think disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films). <br /><br />you know the story already, cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters. she goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper...<br /><br />this is a film very much to be watched with other people. immediate family is not good enough. to enjoy this, i recommend you watch it with friends (and immediate family, if you like. :-) ). <br /><br />i recommend this to people who like disney at least a little bit, people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice. enjoy! :-)
