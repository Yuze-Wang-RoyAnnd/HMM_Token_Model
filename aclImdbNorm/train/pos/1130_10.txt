'iphigenia' is the great achievement of michael cacoyannis. this masterful play is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast. cacoyannis achieved the impossible. he managed to film a greek tragedy to screen without losing its effectiveness and importance. a stellar greek cast helps him in this. newcomer tatiana papamoschou is extremely impressive as iphigenia. equally impressive is irene papas ,who even though she sometimes seems over the top, it is very realistic. a wonderful greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by michael cacoyannis, with an excellent music score by mikis theodorakis which is ideal in every scene.<br /><br />p.s. rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film oscar by only 1 vote!!!
