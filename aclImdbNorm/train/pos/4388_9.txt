michael caton-jones's scottish period piece bears little connection to the sir walter scott novel of the same name...<br /><br />the film opens in the scottish highlands, with robert roy mcgregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of his lordship james graham's cattle... the scene then switches to a sword-fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs, adorned shirts, soft colored coats, paleface make-up and conventional gestures...<br /><br />macgregor lives under the protection of a local lord named marquis of montrose... when he enters an ill-advised trade agreement with montrose, he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of montrose's evil-doers... the unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie, though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape... when rob roy is finally compelled to rebel against the english soldiers, the action becomes well understood, ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade...<br /><br />liam neeson injects heroism and passion to his character... he is intelligent, fair and virile... he carries his height with grace as the scottish chieftain of a small community... he is a loving father, a passionate lover, and a noble husband, driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains... he'd rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust... <br /><br />oscar winner jessica lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife, a proud peasant woman, brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat... lange's lines are filled with dignity and integrity: 'i will think on you dead, until my husband makes you so. and then i will think on you no more.'<br /><br />john hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make montrose something more than a greedy marquis, ruthless with money and tempered by the english court's fashion for foppery... he is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service... honor, in his view, seems a quaint notion... he has two objectives: ruin the reputation of his rival, the duke of argyle, and to hunt down the fugitive macgregor... he sends his soldiers to burn the highlanders' homes, to kill their people and their livestock...<br /><br />tim roth
