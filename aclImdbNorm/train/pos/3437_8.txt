some genre films need to be dressed up. this one was an exception. taken on its own merit, it's a dressed down version of the horror genre film. with minimal special effects, it manages to be a psychological study of sorts, with a simple yet existential theme - who gets hit by the bus, and why her? it's not a great film, yet because there is little contrived about it, the story works. subtle, and all about the interactions of the characters. actually, there is one contrivance in the opening scenes, but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what's to come. i very much appreciate the balance of male and female energy, and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people reacting to a physical and psychological challenge. you will enjoy the film if you have some empathy, value the need for a bit of adventure in your life, and wonder "what would i do in this situation?"
