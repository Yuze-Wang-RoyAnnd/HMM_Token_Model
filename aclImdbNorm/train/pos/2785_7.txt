"bend it like beckham" reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by john hughes. everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes. nothing wrong with this, however. "bend it like beckham" is an absolute treat from beginning to end. my wife and i found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre). watch this movie and enjoy.<br /><br />grade: b+
