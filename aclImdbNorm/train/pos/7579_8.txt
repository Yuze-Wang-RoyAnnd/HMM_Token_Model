after the glories of the snare, it was unlikely that a further outing for hanzo would be able to do any better, and this doesn't breach that expectation, but it is a fine film and sits neatly in between the fun but messy first chapter and the terrific second in terms of quality and general entertainment. the screenplay comes from yasuzo masumura and has some parallels with the snare, as well as the expected hi-jinks of a hanzo film, but the film rings nice little changes on the formula by amping up the character driven humour as well as giving the film a quieter, reflective edge. the film opens with hanzos assistants scared by a ghost, and typically he decides straight away that he needs to have carnal knowledge of this ghost. it turns out that the ghost is serving as a guard for a stash of stolen coins and from this set-up unfolds a story of theft, corruption and usury, with expected violent and sleazy results. shintaro katsu is terrific as expected as hanzo, coming across effortlessly as a deadly fighter and sexual force of nature, he is equally good in the moments of knowing humour and likable, almost an ordinary gentleman in moments of drama, it is a beautifully rounded performance filled with social conscience and a touching edge of personal feeling. the expected comedy comes off fine as well, his moments with "snake" magobei are perhaps the most amusing of the series whilst his interactions with his servants are kookily entertaining as ever. though neatly laden throughout with nice moments, a fair amount of action and a little sleaze, the film does lose a little from a relatively restrained approach. there are shades of both prior films, the plotting, pace and smarts recall the snare and when the film aims for sleaze it does very well, with a potently handled and impactful early interrogation sequence. equally though, director yoshio inoue presents potentially sleazy scenes in a more experimental way as per kenji misumi's less well handled work in sword of justice, with consequences sometimes very nice, as with a man playing a tune on the koto, with close ups of his fingers plucking at the strings as unbeknownest to him hanzo ploughs his wife, and sometimes a bit weak, as with an orgy that is reduced to a nudity free psychedelic whirl of limbs in motion that just looks confusing. the nudity and bloodshed is generally downplayed which is a pity, though there is a little of both a stronger approach would have worked better, it is definitely the sort of film where trashy and unrestrained nudity and violence are most appropriate. but even with less in the way of exploitative goods this is still thoroughly entertaining stuff, the predictable moments are wrought with aplomb and there is more than enough intrigue and excitement, even some effective surprises to go around. its a film for the fans really, playing off the work laid down in the previous instalments and working sweetly if not spectacularly with it. altogether a near wholly pleasurable if mildly flawed end to a delightful trilogy, the second best of them and well worth a watch for enthusiasts of such things.
