resident evil:code veronica is a great well made video game,it has great graphics,very comfortable controls,a great storyline and high fun factor.the storyline to this is claire redfield gets taken to an island for trespassing on umbrella grounds,and reaking havoc at they're main lab while looking for her brother.code veronica's graphics are very good,the fire and rain effects are great looking.the controls are comfy,but the button pattern doesnt fit the dreamcast control,makeing it hard to get used to.its still fun going around some wierd disturbing place,shooting the guts out of zombies.code:veronica also has a little bit of "romance" between the two main characters.you also get to play as chris redfield,from resident evil 1.the sound in this game is better than ever,for example,even though i hate the new feature,when the giant spiders crawl,they're feet make a disturbing scampering sound,and the guns sound alot more realistic.great graphics,outstanding story,comfy controls,and realistic sound makes resident evil code:veronica a definite loved. i give it a 10 out of 10.
