this is the second part of 'the animatrix', a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'the matrix'.<br /><br />in this one we learn how men and machines could not work and live together. it is a little history lesson in the world of 'the matrix'. not as good as the first part ('the final flight of the osiris') but still pretty entertaining.
