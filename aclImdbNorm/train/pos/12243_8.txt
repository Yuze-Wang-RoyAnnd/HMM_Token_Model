kate beckinsale is as good if not better than gwyneth paltrow as emma in this movie, although i really liked gwyneth paltrow in the other emma version. they're both good in different ways. kate beckinsale as emma seems more interesting, almost, though. and i liked the woman who played harriet smith in this movie better, too...she was more believably sweet and sentimental. there are certain things i like better about the gwyneth paltrow version, though, like how the humorous side is more apparent.
