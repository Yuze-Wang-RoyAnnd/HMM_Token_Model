i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s - and it stayed with me! it's charming, loud, colourful - a great kids film. i put it on for some friends at a party recently - and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la "meet the feebles" but no - its wholesome clean fun.<br /><br />jack wild is in fine form, as is mama cass, and the somehow attractive witchy poo.<br /><br />if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30's this will re-create that surreal childhood saturday morning vibe!<br /><br />even if i've realised now that puf himself is a bit crap - as all he does is get captured and run away! quality tv movie - if, like me, you are into death metal - you'll love it!
