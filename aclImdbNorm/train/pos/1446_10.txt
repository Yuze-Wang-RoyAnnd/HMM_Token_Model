has al pacino ever been in a bad movie? his name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. this is as good a performance as he's ever given. pacino is an american olivier. and this is a political thriller as good as they get. there are no good guys and no bad guys. but the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. not only is pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. this outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex or gutter language. there is murder. there are bad people. but they come across effectively without crossing the line. a film like this restores my jaded faith in hollywood. i don't award many tens. this one richly deserves it!
