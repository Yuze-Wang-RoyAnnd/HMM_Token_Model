"the lion king" is without a doubt my favorite disney movie of all time, so i figured maybe i should give the sequels a chance and i did. lion king 1 1/2 was pretty good and had it's good laughs and fun with timon and pumba. only problem, i feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation. well, i would highly recommend this movie for lion king fans or just a night with the family. it's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first. so, hopefully, i'll get the same with the third installment to the lion king series. sit back and just think hakuna matata! it means no worries! <br /><br />8/10
