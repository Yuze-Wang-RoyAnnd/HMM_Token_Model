a bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching. a wheelchair-bound young woman jane hatchard(helena bonham carter)is teamed with a reluctant caregiver, richard(kenneth branagh). richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight. he builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. he wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent, dying jane, who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills. wheelchair-bound and full of spirit, her last dying wish is to loose her virginity. she offers herself to richard, who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed. i found this flick ambitious and humorous. even in this role, carter has a certain charisma and likability.
