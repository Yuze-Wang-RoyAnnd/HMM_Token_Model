hal hartley's henry fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work. it has immense character depth, subtle, complicated dialogue, and an excellent, emotional ending which captivates. i remember pausing it several times during my first viewing to absorb what i was seeing and feeling. henry fool was a complete movie from start to finish, and needed no sequel.<br /><br />thus i was surprised when i heard about fay grim. fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and seemed to exist more as the troubling imposition of real-world vanity and ignorance for her brother simon to be forced to deal with as he matures. in her own movie, fay matures herself, though her maturity takes a very different road. simon went from near autistic isolation to a merely somewhat-introverted genius. fay starts her adult journey as an immature, utterly normal, spoiled child and responds to the onslaught of ridiculous circumstances by becoming a mature, utterly normal, experienced adult who holds no advantages. she deals with problems the way any human does, with determination, a little thought, and weary disdain. while simon learned to control his mind, fay learns to control her emotion.<br /><br />the movie contains several fondly remembered elements of its prequel, but differs vastly in tone for most of the film. henry fool showed you a harsh, boring, ignorant world which contrasted with simon's inner passion and creativity. in fay grim, the world is a lively, crazy, emotional place which shows the silliness of her young life, and through contrast unearths the inner wise woman which had not been previously developed or nurtured by her similarly weak mother.<br /><br />the movie is in two parts, the first dealing with the beginning of fay's struggle and subsequent hardening due to authoritarian hostility, and the second dealing with her battle to soften only just enough to regain henry. at first, fans of henry fool may find themselves wondering how the movie can even be considered a sequel, and thinking it is profane to follow such an intense film with spy game antics and physical comedy. but this is where the subtlety of fay grim lies. the sequel is about fay's journey, and as i said before, hers is one of finding the life-giving sanity in chaos, not the creative chaos in staid order. parker posey is an excellent actress who captures hal hartley's tongue in cheek humor perfectly. elina l"owensohn perhaps eclipses her in emotional commitment to the role, allowing parker to play both straight man and comic against the lively, stage-like comedy happening around her.<br /><br />with the entrance of henry into the picture, the movie begins to take a sobering turn. hal hartley's movies are all plays, and every play must come full circle. by the end, you are shown fay's newly developed character and integrity are the offspring of her time with the fatally intense henry, whose piercing honesty and unique passion lights a spark in anyone he meets.<br /><br />fay grim is an excellent movie which does not surpass henry fool, but shows through hal's range that the nuances of his art are the proof of his genius.<br /><br />honestly, i think anyone who bashes this movie not only missed the point by a mile (and especially the subtlety in parker posey's acting), but could not have been much interested the movie henry fool.
