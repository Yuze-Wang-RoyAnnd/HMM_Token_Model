finally a thriller which omits the car chases, explosions and other eye catching effects. the movie combines a simple plot (assasination of a french president) with an excellent background. it takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities, and explains why we would obey almost every order (even murder) which would be given to us.<br /><br />furthermore it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled. the best thing on this movie is, that there is no classic "hollywood end" which can easily be predicted.
