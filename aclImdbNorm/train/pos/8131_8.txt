<br /><br />if you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's funny if you don't get the references, as a straight comedy.<br /><br />haven't seen much of the much hyped cb4, but what i did see didn't have the heart that this little stormer has.<br /><br />haven't heard from the people involved since, which is a surprise. the film is very similar to spinal tap, which is no bad thing, and i think a lot of the dialogue, while priceless in tap is funnier here, probably because i'm more into rap than rock theses days, so my own judgment does cloud that point.<br /><br />the rap songs are funny as hell, and it's basically spot the reference for most of the film, not all of them are in-your-face, which means the physical comedy and the one-liners get priority over the take-offs.<br /><br />great fun, one to watch twice if there ever was a movie.
