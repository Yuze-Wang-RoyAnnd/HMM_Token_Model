playwright sidney bruhl (a wonderfully over-the-top michael caine) would kill for a hit play. enter young wonder kid (a solid reeve) who's just written such a play. weave into this bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by cannon) and a german psychic (a very funny irene worth) and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick.<br /><br />while not up to "sleuth" standards, "deathtrap" is none the less a very capable, twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by ira levin. the performers are obviously having a field day with the material, with caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto.<br /><br />the film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall "deathtrap" is solid, well acted and suspenseful fun.
