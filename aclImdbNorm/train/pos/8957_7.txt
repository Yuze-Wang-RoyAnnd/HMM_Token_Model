have not seen this 1958 film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed kim novak playing the role as gil holroyd who is an actual witch and has an aunt named queenie holroyd who is also a witch and gillian also has a brother warlock named nick played by jack lemmon. when gillian sets her eyes on shep henderson,(james stewart) who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry; gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with gillian. the story tells that a real witch cannot fall in love, blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between shep and gillian, so nick and aunt queenie decided they have to do something about this situation. great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from 1958.
