nathan detroit (frank sinatra) is the manager of the new york's longest- established floating craps game, and he needs $1000 to secure a new location. confident of his odds, he bets the city's highest-roller, sky masterson (marlon brando), that he can't woo uptight missionary sarah brown (jean simmons). 'guys and dolls (1955)' is such a great musical because it deftly blends the contrasting styles of film and stage. during a dazzling opening sequence, crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm, stopping and starting as though responding to backstage cues. even the walking movements themselves are stylised and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. mankiewicz's new york city is a glittering flurry of art deco colour and movement, a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal thuggery seems perfectly genial. <br /><br />as i write this review, i've just received word that jean simmons has passed away, age 80. this, unbelievably, was the first time i'd seen her in a film, yet she dazzled me from the beginning. her idealistic and sexually-repressed sarah comes out of her shell following an alcohol binge in havana, letting loose with an adorably playful rendition of "if i were a bell." even though both simmons and brando were non-singers, producer sam goldwyn decided not to dub their vocals, contending that "maybe you don't sound so good, but at least it's you." despite goldwyn's backhanded confidence, the pair both do well to carry entire musical numbers themselves. simmons suggests the same child-like liveliness that audrey hepburn might have brought to the role, and brando exudes such self-assurance and charisma that it doesn't matter that his singing voice isn't quite there.
