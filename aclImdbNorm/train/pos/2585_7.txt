here's a rare gem for those of you that haven't seen or most likely not even heard of this. during the 80s, dennis quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early 90s, dennis quaid disappeared from the scene. in 1993, he burst back onto the big screen with three movies, all of which unfortunately bombed. two of those films i liked very much, and let me elaborate on one of them.<br /><br />"wilder napalm" is a crazy flick about two brothers, wallace (quaid) and wilder (arliss howard), whom are...fire starters: yes they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /><br />wilder has decided not to use his power anymore (for anything not useful anyway) after a fatal incident during his youth, where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house which killed a man who was inside unbeknownest to them. nowadays, wilder is a firefighter and is married to the wacky vida (debra winger), who is under house arrest for, guess what, arson (see the movie to understand this better). wilder also hasn't spoken to wallace in 5 years, because wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party.<br /><br />wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for amusement. he also runs a carnival and is the head clown. when the carnival comes to wilder's town, wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see vida, whom which wallace has been in love with! vida's house arrest sees its end, but wilder is preoccupied. so, wallace steps in and the fun begins. brother vs. brother...fighting fire with fire! <br /><br />some great fireball throwing in this flick...eat your heart out, drew barrymore!<br /><br />the film also has some really weird, yet funny elements, like wilder's fire unit sings songs acapella during firefights and after wards. jim varney (globally known as 'ernest') pops in as wallace's redneck carnival buddy. "wilder napalm" is brilliantly shot...and cleverly put together...very off the wall and avant-guard.<br /><br />give this one a look...
