spoilers through: <br /><br />i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie. it's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride. i definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating.<br /><br />perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven't seen the original.something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus, have little to compare it to. this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.<br /><br />there were a few things i liked about it. one was the casting of kowalkski. viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be excellent and he was. this was a great role for him.<br /><br />another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that it's made for television. i had no idea this was the case when watching it. it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.<br /><br />i also found the story to be very absorbing. i'm not one for action movies but i got sucked into this. plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama, mysticism, a love story, quirky people every which way you turned. (i didn't even recognize priestly.) and it was touching. this was not a great movie but it is watchable.<br /><br />and then there's the ending. it packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point, it's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end. i am not sure how i feel about the ending. the implication was that kowalkski survived and though i'm highly skeptical of how that would be possible, it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie.<br /><br />so i'd have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way, which i don't usually like but for some reason, is almost forgivable in this movie. admittedly, a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical?) but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well. however, having said that, i will admit i can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because, though i have not seen the original, i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results. (my big dislike is actually sequels.) but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality.<br /><br />people have compared this to smoky and the bandit. how about a road version of "legends of the fall" meets "thelma and louese" as well? i sure felt touches of both films(both of which i'm a fan of.) i do not think however, that this was a great film. it was better then average to me but far from great. but it was an absorbing, adrenalin fueled, touching movie with excellent casting of the main character. my vote is 7 of 10.
