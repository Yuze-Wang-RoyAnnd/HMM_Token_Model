ettore scola, one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have, is not yet available on dvd... (it's summer 2001 right now....) mysteries to goggle the mind. <br /><br />this grand classic returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a sophia loren - summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape ... it is a true gift. <br /><br />to avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point: i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film. he never saw the film before and "doesn't like those italian oldies..." like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder. even during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent. <br /><br />this special day is truly special. a wonder of refinement. and a big loss if you haven't seen it (yet)...
