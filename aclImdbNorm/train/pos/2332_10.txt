"imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch" as soon as i first heard that, my attention was locked on the trailer, and after the first episode i found my self in love with this show. a modern day fairy tale that brings my spirits up and holds my attention throughout the entire show. i think the acting and casting is just perfect, each character brings something unique to the show that adds to it's perfection. even the one time villains manage to overflow with a unique sense, from the bee man to the guy who can swallow kittens, they never seem to let me down. and the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up being purely comical (such as an exploding scratch & sniff book)<br /><br />even with the large amount of crime shows we have now a days, daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest, being not just a mystery but a love story, comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama all baked into one wonderful pie.....err show.<br /><br />what really shocked me was the fact that it was on abc, for years i never had a reason to turn to abc, but this brought me back each week with a smile on my face. it was as if pushing daisies brought abc back to life for me. but just like that, after two seasons, a few awards, a large fan base and positive responses from critics the show has been dropped. it seems as though ned has touched abc again and forever killed it for me. i will always be a fan of this show though, and i recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch.
