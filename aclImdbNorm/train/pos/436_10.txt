i absolutely loved this movie. i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd. the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy. the actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work. there is humor, drama and relationship issues all in good time. this requires 10 lines but i just can't think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get 10 lines. so sorry about this. what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it. i am looking forward to view again but it isn't available.
