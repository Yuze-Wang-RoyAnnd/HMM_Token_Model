this is, in my opinion, much better than either of the 2 1990's versions, but is still not all that good. it feels dated, probably because it is, but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980's period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbey.<br /><br />the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90's versions, and st john rivers is at least covered, although not very well. timothy dalton is very good as rochester, but the actress playing jane is much too old. there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it.
