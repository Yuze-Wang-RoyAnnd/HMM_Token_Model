you can debate prince's acting talent, or even his choice to parody his own life in this film. there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now. he seems like a shadowy has-been twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and fantastic. <br /><br />having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in'85) i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time. from tipper gore (al's wife) trying to censor "little nikki" and every thing else under the sun via the pmrc (parents music resource center) to every "air band" at the time impersonating prince, it was the absolute hottest thing out. for a few weeks at least, prince was bigger than madonna and michael jackson. <br /><br />we all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered. it didn't disappoint. everyone was caught up. i was an mtv junkie at the time(they actually played music then....all the time)prince played at least once or twice an hour. i must qualify this commentary by saying that, at that time, my favorites were billy idol, oingo boingo, the fixx, flock of seagulls and others in the punk/ new wave genre' the music of prince at the time transcended all types and styles. one of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was soooooooo big then. all the things that remind you of the 80's were iconic then. it was mainstream and it seems like a clich'e' now. it got so popular that it became ridiculous. it's like the rappin' granny commercial for wendy's hamburgers. <br /><br />it looks stupid now because everyone was caught up in it (sadly, kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something. anyway, i hope this gave you all a little insight.
