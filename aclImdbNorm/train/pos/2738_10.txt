i haven't seen this in over 20yrs but i still remember things about it.<br /><br />this film could not have been made in color. the stark grays are what make it, and was life really that simple in the 1950's?? what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the gallows. his breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap. i don't think i could watch that again.....once is plenty. it's like that unnamed guy at the beginning of "papillon" who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine. the guy that said watch this on a double bill with "dead man walking" should have added the last 10 minutes of "i want to live" as well.<br /><br />some of my ancestors being "aristos" went to the guillotine in 1794-95 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense.
