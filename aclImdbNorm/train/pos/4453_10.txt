i really think i should make my case and have every(horror and or cult)movie-buff go and see this movie...<br /><br />i did!<br /><br />it-is-excellent: very atmospheric and unsettling and scary...<br /><br />incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low(read-"no"!)-budget they had....<br /><br />synopsis taken from website: "one morning, an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat. he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse..."<br /><br />on this website(imdb) there is no trailer, but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out...<br /><br />www.softfordigging.com
