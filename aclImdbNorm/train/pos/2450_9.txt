i have been watching this show since i was 14 and i've loved it ever since. i love this show because it's just plain funny! you will enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and funnier everyday and my favorite part is when benny always has her last comments on george after every punchline about his fat giant head.*laughs* i would laugh and i'd watch it with my friends at home it'd be like we were watching a funny movie but short. love george lopez. funny, talented,funny,spectacular. this is a cool-funny-family comedy series enjoyable to everyone and you will definitely enjoy it--i did! and if you haven't watched it yet i suggest that you start watching because you wouldn't want to stop watching it. even though there aren't anymore brand new episodes i still enjoy the re-runs. still funny. never wears off. <br /><br />9/10
