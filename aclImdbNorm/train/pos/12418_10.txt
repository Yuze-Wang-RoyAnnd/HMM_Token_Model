this film and it's sequel barry mckenzie holds his own, are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced. a great story a young aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates, who are just as loveable and innocent as he is.<br /><br />it's chock a block full of great, sayings , where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he's as dry as a dead dingoes donger? great characters, top acting, and it's got great sheilas and more fosters consumption then any other three films put together. top notch.<br /><br />and some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear, and it's full of great celebrities. definitely my two favourite films of all time, i watch them at least once a fortnight.
