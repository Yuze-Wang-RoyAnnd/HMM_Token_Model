set in 2017 (although one might easily mistake it for 1987, judging by the hairstyles and clothing), the running man sees all-round good guy ben richards (schwarzeneggar) framed for a crime he didn't commit. after a daring prison break, he is captured and entered as a contestant in the brutal tv game show the running man, along with some fellow escapees and the pretty token female, amber (maria conchita alonso),.<br /><br />used by the totalitarian government as a way of controlling the masses, the show pits convicts against a range of colourful (and often quite camp) opponents, each having his own unique killing style: dynamo fires electricity from a special suit, buzzsaw uses chainsaws, sub zero has a razor edged ice hockey stick, and fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off contenders. but these killers are no match for ben richards, who dispatches each one in a fittingly gruesome manner (followed by the obligatory witticism).<br /><br />towards the end of the movie, ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities, and gets to exact revenge on the show's nasty host, killian.<br /><br />twenty years ago, arnold schwarzeneggar ruled the action-movie universe and, to his legion of fans, he could do no wrong. the austrian beefcake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his movies: comic book violence plus logic-free plot plus pretty female sidekick plus witty one-liners, minus acting ability equalled massive profits. the running man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to a t and arnie's (mostly male teenage) audience lapped it up (myself included).<br /><br />now, two decades later, and having just finished re-watching the movie for the first time in years, i find it a strange movie: one totally devoid of technical merit, decent acting, and convincing effects, yet somehow totally entertaining. directed by paul michael glaser (best known as det. dave starsky from cult 70s cop show, starsky and hutch), and adapted from a short story by stephen king (writing under the nom de plume, richard bachman), the running man is cheesy 80s tat that looks both incredibly cheap and very dated, yet despite (or maybe because of) the film's shoddiness, it has a special charm which is hard to describe.<br /><br />with no attempt at creating a realistic near-future setting, the film provides plenty of unintentional giggles. check out the scene in which ben discovers amber's secret cache of forbidden cassette tapes(!); marvel at the crap 'futuristic' graphics used on advertising billboards and the running man board game (as a graphic designer, i found these particularly amusing); be amazed at the distinct lack of convincing technological advancements.<br /><br />the running man may be utter rubbish, but it is hugely entertaining utter rubbish that i have no hesitation in recommending to fans of arnie and sci-fi action in general.
