this movie is light, funny, and beautifully filmed. the lightning is absolutely superb, and the colours convincingly remind vermeer paintings.<br /><br />this is sentimental comedy at its best, way above us and french standards, and arguably better than english ones too. <br /><br />every character is touching, and interpretation is close to perfection. isabelle blais is splendid, sylvie moreau is better than in the catherine series, st'ephane gagnon is charming, emmanuel bilodeau is great in that weird role of his, and genevi`eve laroche is the perfect best friend!<br /><br />i could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie, so give it a chance, and add your own review.
