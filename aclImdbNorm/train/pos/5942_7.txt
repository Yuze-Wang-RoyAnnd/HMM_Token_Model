i really liked batman: dead end, i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film. this trailer didn't quite give me the same impression. the story line, or potential story line, was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show.<br /><br />first, michael o'hearn is not that good a superman. i actually thought he, in his brief appearance, made a decent clark kent. sorry, i just don't think of superman as being that buff. the suit kent wore masked his size. batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman. supes is toned no doubt but not bulk. anyway, i didn't care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy. now this may not be just o'hearn's fault, collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction.<br /><br />second, the special effects for flying were cheezy. superman flies through the sky. if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground, with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him. i don't think there were any full body shots of superman flying. evidently the harness and rigging supporting o'hearn must have been located on his lower torso.<br /><br />all in all it was a good trailer. i'd probably pay to see a film, if ever made, and would be sure to catch it on television. the story line, an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries, superman jealous of lois's attraction to wayne, lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman & superman is a good one. i'm sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company, even o'hearn could deliver a decent film. certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately.
