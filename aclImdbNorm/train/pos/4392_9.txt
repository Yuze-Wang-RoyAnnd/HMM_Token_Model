i enjoyed this film very much.tobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake. he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen. and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film. he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before. the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all. i did not know what to expect from jewel's performance but i think she did rather well. lots of exciting scenes. a thoroughly good ride. i am absolutely a fan of maguire's. check out cider house rules. one of the all time best ever.
