well, the movie isn't exactly "funny."<br /><br />okay, i admit, there are a few humorous lines, but definitely nothing that is laugh-out-loud funny. for example: right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars, sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt. before leaving the room to retrieve the key, he tells her, "okay, don't go anywhere."<br /><br />see, humorous, but not funny.<br /><br />the plot and acting are pretty good.<br /><br />but erika eleniak definitely steals the show. she's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but rewind and re-watch.<br /><br />there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines.<br /><br />overall, 5 stars. i'd only give it three if not for erika eleniak.
