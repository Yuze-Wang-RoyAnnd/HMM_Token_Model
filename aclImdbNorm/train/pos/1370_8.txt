i remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and i was floored by parker posey's performance. and the movie was pretty good also. for anyone who's spent a little too much time in the nightclub/after-hours scene, this movie will have a special charm for you. not too serious, mostly funny, and parker posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gem.<br /><br />i especially liked the diaz character (reminded me of every single struggling dj i've ever known). and many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it.<br /><br />babaganoosh!
