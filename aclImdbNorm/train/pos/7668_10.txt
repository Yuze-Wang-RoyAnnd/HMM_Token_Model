i loved this movie for two reasons: 1) jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it. plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt. (and is absolutely adorable.) 2) the movie helped to inspire a role-playing game i thoroughly enjoy, mage: the awakening. i've shown it at various larp after-parties, and it's always a big hit.<br /><br />d&d love and jeff-squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well-done and thoroughly enjoyable. the plot is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget, and the script, while nothing stellar, was not too badly done, and cheesy in all the right places. a good way to spend an evening.
