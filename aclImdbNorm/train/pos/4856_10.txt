i first saw this movie years ago and have continued to view it several times a year when i have an opportunity. it is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics. should anyone tell you it is foolish or outdated, ignore them... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music. the dancing isn't as important in this film as in other astaire movies so the comedy and acting shine through. see this movie if you can, it may be light but it is still completely amusing. so i know that many people hate black and white films, they think old movies can't really be funny, this movie should make them change their minds. no one i know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused. the only problem with the film: fred astaire singing without dancing. he may be a great performer and capable singer but it just isn't fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. the comedy gets a bit clich'e at times but the vaudevillesque performances of g burns and g allen are just perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughs. give this film a chance even if you don't like old movies, this movie can appeal to the ridiculous in any one.
