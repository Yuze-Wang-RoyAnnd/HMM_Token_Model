i have just watched the whole 6 episodes on dvd. the acting throughout is excellent - no question. there was not quite enough action for me i must say. no real suspense as such, just plenty of first class character development. nothing like tinker tailor in terms of "whodunnit". if you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you. peter egan as the lead magnus pym is excellent.<br /><br />the film portrayed the life of a traitor. a man who should have been a loyal member of the british intelligence service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things. as a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time & time again as a crook and a con man. pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). pym is fatally damaged by his father's influence - it has eaten his moral fibre away. he has no real love or loyalty in him.<br /><br />heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series. very well done though.
