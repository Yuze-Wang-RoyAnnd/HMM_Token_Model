wow. something of a surprise. though flawed, it is far better that i expected.<br /><br />the brand new space liner arcturus with some 3,000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to jupiter. without warning, the ship's cerebral (central computer) sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. <br /><br />soon, there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship's astrogators (penny), the captain (cary), and the director of the shipping line (kenyon).<br /><br />it turns out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is acting<br /><br />erratically. the remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and<br /><br />avoid personal conflicts in order to survive.<br /><br />the film starts out very well. the opening commercial is a very nice touch. there are obvious parallels to 2001: a space odyssey and to the historic<br /><br />sinking of the titanic. the film does slow down at times and has pacing<br /><br />problems, but is generally well made and well acted.
