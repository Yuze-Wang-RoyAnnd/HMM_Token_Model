i saw this movie at the 18th haifa film festival, and it is one of the best i've seen this year. seeing it on a big screen (and i mean big, not one of those tv screens most cinemas have) with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience, as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story, into the picture.<br /><br />the movie presents a set of characters, which are loosely inter-connected. their stories cross at certain points, and the multiplicity of story lines reminded me very much of the great robert altman and his exquisite films. but the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of madrid, which provides the backdrop for the entire movie. it houses the characters, contains the pavements and roads on which they walk, and sets the background atmosphere for all the events, all in beautifully filmed scenes.<br /><br />the movie returns again and again to certain themes (shoes, for instance), and in essence salazar makes his metaphores more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses. he combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters, and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background. a set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters. one excellent example is the scene in which juaquin takes anita across the street for the first time. it might not work on a small screen, but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen.<br /><br />the message of the movie is very positive, and accordingly the movie is light and funny at times. the music along the movie is usually pop, with a few instrumental pieces (i hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day, although i seriously doubt i will).<br /><br />all together, i came out of this movie with a sensational feeling, and i'm not easily impressed (you'll have to take my word for it). for this and more i give this movie a solid 8/10.
