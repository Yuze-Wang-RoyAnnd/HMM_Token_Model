a 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by, while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. that is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic coming of age film from director robert mulligan. mulligan is famous for previously directing summer of '42 in 1971 and to kill a mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the coming of age genre. here he directs newcomers in the principal roles: reese witherspoon, in her film debut, as the 14 year old girl; emily warfield, as the older sister; jason london, as court, the 17 year old boy. reese witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut, displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt, never striking a false note. warfield and london are both equally good as well. the film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity, never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from jenny wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. the music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive. the beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director freddie francis, who was in his 70's when this was shot. tess harper and sam waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957, caring, strict, and emotionally simple. gail strickland is good also as the boy's mother. there are feelings to sort out, lessons to learn, and truths to face in this sweet-natured film that packs an emotional wallop. to date, this is robert mulligan's last film. this is one of the very best films of 1991. **** of 4 stars.
