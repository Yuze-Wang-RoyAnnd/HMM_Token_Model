anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the matrix has never seen this movie. the fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath yuen woo ping, who also did the fights in the matrix. and the fight scenes are somethin.<br /><br />li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain, who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian (ya got me). when other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade, li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them.<br /><br />there are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie (one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices). the fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches; the body count is way up there. li has seldom been better, and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars (yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier). anthony wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord (no suprises there; he makes a cameo in every hk movie). it's unfortunate they don't make action movies like this in the us; i wouldn't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that i crave so much. recommended.
