after being forced to sit through some real stinkers (racing stripes, shark boy and lava girl) -- i truly enjoyed watching "fried worms". for once, i did not guess the ending! it was funny and entertaining and didn't resort to a ton of gross-out humor, despite the title. my boys (6 and 10) both loved it too -- oh and my 45 year old "boy" had a smile on his face the whole time. this is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents. the relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. "he is not stopping singing just to annoy me!!" also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right-on with the way kids behave. of course the parents have to act a little goofy -- but my favorite scenes involved the dad getting used to his new job. have fun!
