in 1996's "101 dalmatians," cruella de vil was arrested by the london metropolitain police (god bless them) for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - dalmatians. all covered in mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in the "tin can." now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from the jail. i say, that's about 28 years - in dog years!!!!!<br /><br />so, in 2000, disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic film and it is hereby dubbed "102 dalmatians." in it, there is a 102nd dalmatian added to the family (oddball is the name, i think; i should know this since this was just shown on tv recently), and the puppy had no spots!!!!! also, while cruella (again played by glenn close) has escaped again, she wanted a bigger, better coat - made once again out of the puppies!!!!!<br /><br />i especially liked the theme song - i'm sure everybody loves the "atomic dog" song from the 70s or so. and now, we hear a bit of it in this movie!!!!!<br /><br />"102 dalmatians" is such a great film that i keep on wondering - when will there be a "103 dalmatians?????" lol<br /><br />10 stars
