two years ago i watched "the matador" in cinema and i loved everything about this movie. obviously, i was totally under impression of pierce brosan's magnificent role. yesterday, i caught this movie again on tv so i looked at it a bit deeper. now, i can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man. <br /><br />brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of julian noble, tired hit-man who has no friends. soon julian meets danny wright (greg kinnear) in mexico city, man who's got bad luck: his son died in accident, his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife bean (hope davis).<br /><br />i always liked movies like this; crime movie with big touch of humor. mostly that humor comes from brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d.... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "i look like a bangkok hooker on a sunday morning, after the navy's left town." brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually. i also like greg 'typical american face' kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like danny wright.<br /><br />so i recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of brosnan ever. he'll make you smile and admire him at the same time. great brosnan in not equally great movie.
