i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film. i am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film. this happened quite by accident, with the discovery of a movie called clerks late one night on television. the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was 1) technically amateurish and 2) brilliantly written. when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was clerks, i started to get interesting. when he said his main influence was the station agent, a movie i'd seen on dvd a week prior, i decided i had to go and check it out. the result could be described along the same lines as clerks, although the two films are nothing alike content wise. both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing. whereas clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation, less like me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy, he's always running one way or another, filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones. the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant. i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up, young men still have the same problems they always have. the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular, crafts wonderfully honest characters, and has them do completely believable things. as far as indie cinema goes, this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint, but from an artistic one, it is very close.
