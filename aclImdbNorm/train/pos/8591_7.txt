this was a pretty decent movie. this movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained. just a typical hollywood film. this movie will never win an oscar or anything and definitely doesn't deserve one, but i thought it was pretty good. it's kind of like the show 24 but set into movie format. if you like the whole we've got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick. i personally think that storyline has been done way too much, but the sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the secret service. all in all, this movie won't leave your jaw to the floor or change your life, but who says every single movie has to be like that to be good?
