brilliant! my wife and i joined the sprawling line to see holly at the edinburgh film festival. after seeing the film, i can understand why there was such a long line. holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people. she is a young girl, he is a worn out westerner. the film grasped every bone in our body. there aren't any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch - its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut. the film is beautifully shot. among others, we loved the scene where patrick teaches holly to ride a small motorcycle. thuy ngoyen's rawness (cant believe this is her first acting job)and ron livingston's performance stayed with me for a couple of days. highly recommended.
