i saw this film a few years ago and i got to say that i really love it.jason patric was perfect for this weird role that he played.the director?i don't too many things about him...and i don't care.the screenplay is good,that's for sure.in just a few words i have to say about this movie that is weird,strange,even dark,but it's a good one.i saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then.i want to see it again and again.i know that i'm not gonna get sick of watching it.the scenes,the atmosphere,the actors,the story...everything is good.the movie should have lasted longer.i think 120 minutes should have been perfect.i was hoping for a part 2 for this movie.too bad it din't happened.jason patric:you're the man ! very good movie. the end. :-)
