featuring a few of hammer's all-stars, this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the fates of it's previous tenants, whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective, in search of a missing actor.<br /><br />story number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, deals with a writer and his wife who've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels. he creates a demented character named dominic, who's a very creepy looking strangler, and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes. after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help, a sub-plot is introduced which frankly, didn't really work for me. i won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />the next story (the best in my opinion) stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson, a man who's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum(that deals in the macabre) where he's very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. soon thereafter, an old friend(who also has a history with this woman) is in town for business and drops by to see him. the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye.<br /><br />story three stars one of my very favorites...christopher lee, who plays john reid. after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane, the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid suppresses his daughter. well come to find out...if she knew what lee did, she would have certainly understood.<br /><br />the final story is a rather light-hearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt. after buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant, actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he's portrayed several times in his career.<br /><br />overall, the pacing and direction were very good, as was the most of the performances. there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance. this one's a keeper, and comes highly recommended.
