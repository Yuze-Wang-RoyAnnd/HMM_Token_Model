this movie is simply awesome.it was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb.this movie did not create any controversy in india (as far as i know) and its publicity was also kept low.initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing...most of the indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember ashoka, mangal pandey,loc etc..<br /><br />there have been so many movies in india which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added.<br /><br />but its treatment is pretty similar to pinjar movie (also a must watch).<br /><br />if it counts then i would like to thank anil kapoor ( producer ) and firoz abbas khan ( the director) for making such a great movie..
