this game was really great and quite a challenge. it has a great, spooky story line and the graphics are also very good. i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish. the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me.<br /><br /> a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fans.<br /><br />>
