very few so called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. this one crosses that border with flying colors. just a remake, i don't think so! i saw it theatrically at the age of nine, and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film. <br /><br />the film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart. the earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie, but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film. this update is more epic and cinematic. still, i thoroughly recommend both films.<br /><br />this film is certainly a must-see for an animal lover. we have the wise old golden retriever, shadow; the sharp, sarcastic himalayan cat, sassy; and the young, fun-loving american bulldog, chance. the animals are brilliantly voiced by don ameche, sally field, and michael j. fox, respectively.<br /><br />there is virtually nothing offensive in the film. there is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing extreme. no hard violence, save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall, an angry porcupine, and a dark railroad shaft.<br /><br />hilarious, scary, moving, and above all real, it surprised me to see that this film didn't win any awards, not one. nevertheless, i will have to say this is just as good as some of the best picture nominees nowadays.
