this film is hilarious, original, & beautifully directed. i have become a big bad swim groupie, tracking it to film festivals whenever & wherever i can. i've seen it about half a dozen times now, & each time, enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to come out in years. at nearly every festival it has screened, it has either sold out, or won the audience favorite award. it's clear that people love this film, & even clearer why they do. the cinematography is superb, the characterization & acting brilliant, the ending fantastic, & the direction filled with compassion, wisdom & the art of perfect timing. it's hard to believe this is ishai setton's first film. i hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.
