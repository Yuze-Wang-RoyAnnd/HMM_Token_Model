greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, nina foch,(julia ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. julia obtains the position and is hired by a mrs. hughes, (dame may witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. george macready, (ralph hughes) is the son of mrs. hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. this strange family all live in a huge mansion off the cornwall coast of england and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense.
