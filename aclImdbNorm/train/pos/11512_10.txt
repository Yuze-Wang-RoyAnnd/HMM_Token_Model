when originally screened in america in 1972, 'the night stalker' became the highest rated made-for-t.v. movie in history. based on jeff rice's unpublished novel, it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak ( the late darren mcgavin ) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern-day las vegas. when it arrived on british television four years later, it did not quite have the same impact, but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning, as indeed was i. we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen. <br /><br />i did not know of the existence of 'the night strangler' until it turned up nearly a decade later. i.t.v., who screened the 'kolchak' movies, had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series; they felt 'barnaby jones' starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw, and anyway, viewers might confuse 'kolchak' with 'kojak'! for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine. i could not even purchase the jeff rice novels.<br /><br />then something wonderful happened. in 1990, b.b.c.-2 put out the show as part of a late-night friday series devoted to the supernatural called 'mystery train', hosted by richard o'brian. 'kolchak' found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of 'the brain eaters' and 'earth vs.the spider'. the opening titles were trimmed, removing kolchak's whistling, and the closing credits...well, there were none.<br /><br />the first episode screened was 'werewolf'. i cannot say i was overly impressed, but stuck with it, and am i glad that i did!<br /><br />i really wish i'd seen it in 1974. my twelve year old self would have adored it. creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder it fired chris carter's imagination. <br /><br />the show's biggest asset was, of course, mcgavin. unlike the recent kolchak, the original was an everyman figure, eccentrically dressed, rather conservative. he was to the supernatural what 'columbo' was to crime. the late simon oakland was great too as kolchak's bad-tempered boss tony vincenzo. the scripts overflowed with wonderful, dry wit. i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror. when the twenty episodes ended, i felt bereft.<br /><br />'the x-files' came along a few years later and filled the void - but only to an extent. i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back. i am glad that the show was never revived though. without oakland it would not have been the same.<br /><br />i have the rice books now and have read them several times. i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first ( in his book 'danse macabre' ) as it is as good as anything he has written. <br /><br />alright, so some of the monsters were hardly state-of-the-art, but so what? the new 'kolchak' totally missed the point of the original. what you don't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do...<br /><br />best episode - 'horror in the heights' worst episode - 'the sentry'
