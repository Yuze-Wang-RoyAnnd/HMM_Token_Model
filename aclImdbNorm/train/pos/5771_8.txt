this is one of those movies that you happen across when you're channel surfing on a saturday afternoon, and you get drawn into it and end up watching the whole thing. i thought that it was well acted and it really made me feel for the characters. though it's a bit slow moving, focusing more on the relationships between bonnie and clyde and their family members, it never got boring. we don't really see too much of all the robberies that they were so legendary for, and instead most of the shootouts take place when they're ambushed by the police. i thought tracey needham, who played bonnie, really did a good job with her character. going from a nice country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenging thing to portray, and i enjoyed the subtlety she brought to the role.<br /><br />overall, an above average effort, especially considering it was a made for tv movie.
