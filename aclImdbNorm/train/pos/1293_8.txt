this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man. phillipe harel as notre heros is a bit like an amalgam of robert de niro in taxi driver, inspector clouseau (in his stoicism) and chauncey gardiner in being there (also peter sellers). he is single yet doesn't have a clue how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he really makes no effort at all!<br /><br />he has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom - his friend jose garcia as tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood (he's 28 and admits he's never had sex).<br /><br />very good outdoor shots of paris and rouen, where the two software people travel on business. they try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail. my theory is that they're trying the wrong places - they go to more-or-less 'youth' nightclubs; they should try the type that has older people, more their own age.<br /><br />harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de niro effort, as in taxi driver, urging his friend/colleague to go and stab some bloke who's pulled a nice-looking girl in the nightclub.<br /><br />worth watching.
