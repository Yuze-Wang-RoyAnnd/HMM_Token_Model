raggedy ann & andy is the first movie i ever saw in the theaters. my dad took my sister and i, and the funny thing is - when we got home, dad asked us "what do you want to do now?" and we said we want to watch raggedy ann & andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how i remember it. i was five years old at the time.<br /><br />this movie was pretty scary for a five year old. the scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was magical, and a few scenes -- i wish i could find it again, and will likely seek it out now.<br /><br />i remember i loved raggedy ann & andy.
