the maxx is a deep psychological introspective lightly camouflaged as a weird-out superhero story. julie winters is a "freelance social worker" in an unnamed filthy city, ridden with crime, and she and everyone she knows has a lot of issues to work through. the maxx is her friend and client, a street bum who thinks he's a costumed superhero - or is it the other way around?<br /><br />the maxx is not to be missed for the artwork, the story itself, or the excellent voice work - particularly the late barry stigler's deliciously urbane, drippingly evil voicing of the main villain, mr. gone.<br /><br />if you get the chance to see this, don't miss it.
