having looked at some of the other comments here, i have a main complaint with this presentation. <br /><br />the two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful "victim," and the handsome, obviously extremely "off-center," blue-collar protagonist (if just short of "totally-deranged") - take turns beating the hell out of each other, sort of like a caucasian kabuki scenario.<br /><br />this is all right, and this is, of course, mainly a "turning-the-tables" story. however, my referenced complaint is that i believe the director got caught-up in his desire to display farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes. beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe, and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes, these distract from the poignancy level of the drama.<br /><br />her roommates i'm certain give performances as written and directed - however, their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing, don't ring true -- based upon farrah's previous experience with this guy, the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions, and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred.<br /><br />but this is a film and story, compelling as much in spite of, as because of, the director's work.
