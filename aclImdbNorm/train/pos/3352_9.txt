there should be a sub-genre in the western called 'the robert mitchum western'. mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, usually undervalued westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches, and bring an elegiac world-weariness more familiar from the films of sam peckinpah. 'man with the gun' is one of his best. directed by orson welles protege richard wilson, it is a stark, monochrome beauty, full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence, as mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army. mitchum's regression from soft-spoken stranger to deranged murderer, with a host of dark emotions in between, is a marvel of expressive, physical acting.
