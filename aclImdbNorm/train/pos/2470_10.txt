after the initial shock of realizing the guts of mr branagh to film this, i was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me. i was not disappointed. so true to shakespeare and yet so accessible. it blew my mind. i always enjoy seeing, or rather listening to, branagh and it made me wonder...is this movie dubbed in other countries? that would be like painting a moustache on the mona lisa.
