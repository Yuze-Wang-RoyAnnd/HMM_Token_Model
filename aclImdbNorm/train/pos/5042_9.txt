the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect. it's a very good thriller. well shot. tough to believe it was bill paxton's directorial debut, though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version. <br /><br />still, there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton. <br /><br />it's a solid story with some great twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun, and best of all, obscured well enough to make them true twists. <br /><br />the child actors in the movie do a great, too. i'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids do a good job.<br /><br />this movie is not gory. it's not very scary. but it is very, very creepy.
