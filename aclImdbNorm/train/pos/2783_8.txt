not one of your harder-hitting stories, and that's a real strength of this film. there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension. they not only spare the audience this, but throw in some surprises at the same time. there are a few disney-ish moments, particularly near the end, but they are manageable. overall, it was worth the rental and it was good, relaxed fun.<br /><br />btw, if you get the dvd, watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi. we followed her directions and it was brilliant! next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it, because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out!
