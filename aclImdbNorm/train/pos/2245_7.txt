salva and his pal bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. we see them panhandling in a car of the underground, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, no one gives them anything! salva, who is a hardened petty criminal doesn't even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next. religion and show business prove to be a winning combination, something that salva capitalizes on.<br /><br />he and bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo. salva shows he is a natural for the reality show. he transforms himself into a christ-like figure who is an instant success in the program. espe, who is a no-nonsense woman who is show's producer, can't escape from the way salva pays her unusual attention. ultimately, salva is the victim of his own success in the end.<br /><br />jordi molla, whose first directorial job this movie is, had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television. spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, has seen its share of the bizarre, which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience.<br /><br />the ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. mr. molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera. candela pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. juan carlos villedo, david gimenez cacho, franco francescoantonio, florinda chico and the rest responded well to the new director.
