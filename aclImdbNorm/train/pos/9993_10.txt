the most hillarious and funny brooks movie i ever seen. i can watch and re-watch the tape 100 times. i laugh my a** off and i cry on some moments. it is really good and funny movie, and if you like brooks - this is a must! in short - brooks (billionare) gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor. the reality bites, but in the end - it is about warm relations between humans... hightly recommend!
