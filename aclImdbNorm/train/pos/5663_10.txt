14 years since this show was made and it is still is the best show ever made. the writing was 1st class and the production second to none. this show would never be made today and that this a shame. i hope if you are thinking about finding this show to watch that you do. <br /><br />ag came out the year i left high school at the time my fav tv show was the x files this gives you an idea of why i first got into this show. ag was a far better program with better writing but only got one reason? i know this is not the only program to only get one season another example that comes to mind would be the lone gunman (x files spin off) it had good writing and was funny but also only got one season. it does not seem right! <br /><br />we also have to remember that this show was around before shows like twilight made dark shows 'cool' so i think this may have also let to the show going down hill. <br /><br />watch this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
