i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it's tv movies five seconds into the picture. this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy, well-crafted mood that is established from the very start. while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story (even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver, b.c.), the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos' excellent acting.
