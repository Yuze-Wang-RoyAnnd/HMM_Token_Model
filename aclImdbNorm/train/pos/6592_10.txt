i have not seen this movie, but i must. having read all three of thor heyerdahl's books (kon tiki, ra and aku aku) i am actively looking for a copy of this movie.<br /><br />the thesis that peruvians migrated to polynesia is alive and well. considering that this crew had no gps, and only an old fashioned valve (tube) radio with a 6-watt output, their voyage was heroic to say the least.<br /><br />please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video.<br /><br />i would be interested in buying it.
