fidois a very odd film. and in many ways, a very good one.<br /><br />my first thought after viewing, was how the hell are they going to market this thing? if shaun of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies. doesn't exactly trip off the tongue.<br /><br />fido has little of shaun's carnage, gore & belly laughs. it is a different beast altogether (forgive the pun).<br /><br />fido kicks off with a black & white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh-eaters into dumb servants.<br /><br />at first i thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la matin'ee, but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle-class nostalgia.<br /><br />young timmy robinon is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in at school. his mom is would-be social climber,and his dad is nervy and detached.<br /><br />seeking to keep up with the joneses, mom (carry-anne moss) has acquired a zombie. jimmy is disinterested at first, but 'fido' (billy conelley) soon proves a great buddy for jimmy. until his collar goes on the blink...<br /><br />fido is not a horror film, but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it is.<br /><br />much of the humour is of the light family variety, and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog/family moments.<br /><br />yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark, truly funny moments, which while welcome, will ensure an r rating for what is, for extended periods, a family comedy.<br /><br />the film looks gorgeous, and is wonderfully performed by all involved.<br /><br />despite its difficult tonal problems, i hope this movie finds a niche, as it's quite a little gem in this year's deluge of cinematic crap.
