i loved this movie. it is rare to get a glimpse of post-partum vietnam, and this movie-sans combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire- did it. i had no idea i'd be so affected by it. what an amazing look at how alien vets feel. it was tough to watch, quite frankly. we all understand the fighting and the apocalypse now type of drama, but this is so so different. what happens when they come back and try to live a life? they can't. it made me very aware of a large group of men that are rattling around lost in america. not able to relate, can't sleep, can't have love affairs, can't deal with "normal society". they feel totally apart. this is a huge tragedy, and one that isn't addressed enough. yeah, we've changed our attitude about vietnam vets, we like them now, but so what? it doesn't seem to have made any difference to them. it's too late? so it was a great film, but i cried a lot. i have no other criticisms.
