i found this film by mistake many years ago & wondered then (still do) why it didn't get the acclaim it should have. well written, beautiful acting, one ironic twist after another, and there is plausibility in what the nefarious characters are attempting. i would not recommend this film for people with short attention spans; it requires sufficient intelligence to comprehend that there maybe a kernel of truth in this story.
