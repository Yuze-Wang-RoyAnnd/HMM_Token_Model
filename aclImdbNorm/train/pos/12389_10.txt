bored with the normal, run-of-the-mill staple films to watch this halloween that i've seen over and over again, i took a chance on "the sentinel", hoping it could get my horror juices flowing again. mind you, i had just come back from seeing the dark castle remake of "the house on haunted hill" - complete and utter crap. thankfully, "the sentinel" blew me away! in a riviting story about a model who moves into a creepy building in brooklyn hights, the film offered everything that i hope to find in a good movie - (1) campy and fantasically juicy characters, exchanges and dialogue, including hilaraious turns by christopher walken, jeff goldblum and especially, martin balsam, as an absent minded professor - (2) horrifying terror! not to give a frame away, but there are scenes in this film that chilled me to my pancreas - (3) fantastic gore, terrific make-up and wacky (if very uneven) direction from michael winner, which flows rather nicely with this unreal treat. if you loved "evil dead 2", "dead alive" and "deep rising" - this will be your queen of favourites. just to emphasize my love for this film - after i watched it for the first time, jaw-dropped, i rewound it and watched it again. it is now one of favourites of all time. do yourself a favour and check it out!
