i was looking through the movie listings in my area on yahoo and seen a movie that had not been advertised. i looked closer and noticed that peter falk and paul reiser were in it. having watched "mad about you", once, i was not a fan of paul reiser. however, i am a big fan of peter falk. so the spouse and i took a chance. we were both swept into this story. the beautiful scenery, the heartfelt acting and the sense of family and moral values that are seldom seen in movies and the world today. not that sappy emoted junk, but real life situations from real life-like people. i even have to say, paul reiser was excellent, although, i still won't watch "mad about you". i don't know where this movie has gone. i heard it was put out in limited release. it should be shared with the world. it is one of the finest movies i have seen. m.
