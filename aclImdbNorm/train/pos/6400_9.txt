this film is a great example of fine storytelling. the acting is superb. the story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake. there were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were, but considering it is a hollywood movie, they showed amazing restraint. there wasn't a single explosion shown in the movie, even though they had one opportunity to. the film, while having suspenseful parts, was not made into an action movie. the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times. well done!
