it's awesome! in story mode, your going from punk to pro. you have to complete goals that involve skating, driving, and walking. you create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic. you are with your friend eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team(you can pick a team to be on) and you then start your own team! there are many levels like new jersey, manhattan, and even school ii(not part of story mode though) from tony hawk's pro skater 2. you can unlock secret skaters like iron man, gene simmons, and another skater. you can create your own goals like skate letters, combo letters, tricktris, gap, and much more. you can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak. if you get bored of doing that, you can do the premade goals in premade parks. the only thing i didn't like about this game was that sometimes it was hard to drive the cars. 9/10.
