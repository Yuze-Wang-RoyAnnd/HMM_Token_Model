(question) what do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in sand? (answer) a good start. well, i don't know peter mattei from adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests, "love in the time of money" is a "good start". a classy shoot with whimsical music box style music, this flick looks at a chain of tenuous relationships as it moves from person a to person b to person c...etc...and back again ending with persons a & b in carousel fashion. the film gently probes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shadings beginning and ending with a street whore and her client. the downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical slams it received. i watched the behemoth "angels in america" last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies kept me spell bound. use caution. i may be the only person who really liked this flick.
