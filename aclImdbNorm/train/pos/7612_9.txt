ok i'll be honest, when i first saw the trailer for the programme, i thought it was an advert for some sun-screen product. with all the people walking around on the beach. despite this i decided to watch it, thinking it would be some new show i could laugh at. but i was seriously amazed.<br /><br />from the first 10 seconds of the program i was hooked, why is he lying in the trees, why did the plane crash etc etc.<br /><br />it's not everyday that a show comes along which combines intelligence, humour, action and suspense. but 'lost' manages all of this. with a great cast and crew, beautiful locations, and pretty decent special effects, 'lost' will catch anyone who tunes in, and is a must see for anyone who's sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality tv.<br /><br />lost is on tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 (uk) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 =o
