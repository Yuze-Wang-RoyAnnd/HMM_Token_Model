why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime. "conan" is perhaps the only sword and sorcery movie better. the brutal violence, cool character designs, and good pacing, make this one of the best fantasies around. it is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that i have ever seen. this is not similar to bakshi's usual frenetic style. it's quite a departure for bakshi, and in my opinion his best work. i hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves.
