lol!!! delirious was so funny.. i was in tears. eddie murphys impressions are absolutely spot on. the best impression was of james brown and mr t> so funny!! its weird how eddie murphy was back then and how he is now delirious is a must see but if u don't like foul language don't watch but amazing and so funny.. i have seen it 6/7 times and still pee myself every time.. this is eddie murphy at his prime and you can see where he got the humour and ideas of movies such as nutty professor from. he does impressions of his family as well, which is real funny.<br /><br />if only i was there...
