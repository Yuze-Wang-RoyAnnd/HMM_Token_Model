i simply never tire of watching freebird. my husband was an extra so i was involved from the start. have kept in touch with jon and have helped out with promoting the film both in cinemas and now the dvd release. even to the extent of distributing promotional postcards on cross channel ferries and various places throughout france. freebird was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus choice casting. only phil daniels could fit the role of grouch. great privilege to meet jon and the cast at the party following the premier in january. anything else you want doing jon just ask, either email or phone, you know how to get me. sue xx
