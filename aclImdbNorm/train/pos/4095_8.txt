now my friends, films like "la b^ete" (aka "the beast" or "o monstro")only can be done in the old continent :),in this film we see all: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense dialogs, etc, etc, etc... in the serious terms now,its an allegory, that men sometimes could be bestial, visceral and brutal,walerian borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. its a astonishing cinematic experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. for all fans of european shocking exploitation, i recommend this film.if you like this one i recommend: "orloff against the invisible man" and "alterated states".
