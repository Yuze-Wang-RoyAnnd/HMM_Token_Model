i first saw this movie in the theater when i was 8 years old and it still cracks me up. the muppets are so cool and they approach show business in a refreshingly naive way. my favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of kermit at a fancy restaurant. this is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents alike. long live kermit, miss piggy and the rest of the gang.
