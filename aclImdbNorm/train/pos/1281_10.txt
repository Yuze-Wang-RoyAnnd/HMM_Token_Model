this film is as good as it is difficult to find. the film's hero (and writer and director) is simon geist- a man "with an agenda." he creates a fake magazine just to have the authority to interview the swine of los angeles- the actors, the models, the musicians- who believe that their own defecation doesn't smell. with clever dialog, zucovic succeeds in doing this. sure, the budget for this film was probably what he paid for a used car, but this film is so solid and so well written that it works very well. any person who can reenact edward munk's 'the scream' in the reflection of a silver trashbin at a local coffee house should be nominated for some type of award. give this film a chance and listen to what it says... because they have been making the same car since 1986... it's called 'the car.' bravo, zucovic, bravo!
