haven't seen the film since first released, but it was memorable. performances by rip torn and conchata farrell were superb, photography excellent, moving story line and everything else about it was of the highest standard. yet it seems to have been pretty much forgotten<br /><br />maybe because uk is an odd market for it but i haven't seen the film on tv or video, which is sad. has it had more success in us where it might rightly be seen as a quite accurate historical drama?<br /><br />always reckon that 50% of a good film is the music and though i'm not certain i think the title theme was a simple but moving clarinet solo of "what a friend we have in jesus". the film then went on to disprove that! am i right or wrong?
