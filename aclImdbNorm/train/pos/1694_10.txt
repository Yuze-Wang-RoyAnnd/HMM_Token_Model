if the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot, it would have been just one more waste of time, money, and creative effort. fortunately, by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds, they have created a comedic marvel. who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like jack nicholson, complete with the lakers t-shirt. do not dismiss this film as trash.
