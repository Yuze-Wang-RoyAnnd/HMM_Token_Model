there is such rubbish on the cable movie channels that i hit a gem with this one. from beginning to end it had me gripped and deserves top marks.<br /><br />father of two sons hears messages from "god" to kill people who he is told are 'demons'.<br /><br />when the opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning of a bad film; exceptionally it is the reverse here as the drama is non-stop from beginning to end.<br /><br />and there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there are no unnecessary or needless sub-plots, and the script is first class. <br /><br />all the actors give wholly convincing performances especially the lead child actor who is exceptional. <br /><br />this film is at least as good as the likes of 'silence of the lambs'.
