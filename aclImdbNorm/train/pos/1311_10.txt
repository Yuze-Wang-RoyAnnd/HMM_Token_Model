this is one of the best movies out there and that's saying a lot being that it was for television. i really wish it was on d.v.d.<br /><br />helen hunt gave such a raw performance. she played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly. when she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing. she is so alone, so he gets to her. when she talks about her mother! wow!<br /><br />steven weber as the serial killer was so shocking! he really brought her into his dark world. it was oscar-worthy. when he talks about killing the kids, scary! when he realizes who she really is! what a scene!!<br /><br />they really don't make them like that anymore. it was a real thriller without being gory.
