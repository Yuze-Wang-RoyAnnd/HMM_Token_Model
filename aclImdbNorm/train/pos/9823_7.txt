i really thought this wasn't that bad. not a great work of art but dermot m was the stronger performer by far. patricia arquette was overacting much of the time. he was actually playing cello which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. besides, he is an incredibly beautiful man. really sexy. add that to the talent, and most anything he's been in is a lot more tolerable. he always gives his all even if some of the projects he's been involved in didn't quite hit the highest mark.. not the fault of the actor in most cases. he's unfortunately been in some strange films that just didn't resonate at the box office. always with a-list actors but just not always a "hit". but he is "worth every penny" of any dvd rented or purchased. see the wedding date with debra messing - one of his best overall films. worth every penny! ; ) (if you haven't seen it yet, do, then you'll understand that quote!)
