red rock west (1993)<br /><br />nicolas cage gets embroiled in a deadly crime without at first knowing it, and the dominos lead to increasing peril, adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn american west of the 1990s. red rock west is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and cage pulls off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease. <br /><br />is the plot over the top? yes. is dennis hopper perfect as a crazed, almost likable killer? yes. does cage stand a chance? well, you have to watch and see. it never lets up, and it took me by surprise the first time i saw it. on second viewing yesterday, i was surprised at how well it held up, how well constructed it was, and how macabre and funny it was at the same time.<br /><br />director ron dahl (who also helped write) is known more for his tv work, but with rounders and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plots. it's saved by its humor by the way, and by the caricatures. the bar is sleazy, the cops questionable. and don't miss a really inspired cameo by dwight yoakam as a truck driver.
