i recently saw this film and enjoyed it very much. it gives a insight to indie movie making and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget yet need a name actor/actress to get people, any people to come see it and give the movie exposure. bobby myeres played by modine and his partner saul - paul linder make an excellent combination finding eccentric miachel bates, a "name" actor played by alan bates was a perfect casting decision in the movie and for the movie. my favorite cast member was sandy ryan played by the magnificent and underrated debra kara unger with her own special performance again in the movie within the movie. if you enjoy thinking when watching a comedy then this one is for you. low budget meets lower budget with high laugh content.
