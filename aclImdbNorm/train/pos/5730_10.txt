dumbland is not for all. in fact dumbland maybe in for nobody except lynch and that's what make it funny and a collective cartoon. violent? yes. profanity? yes. absurd? yes. a piece of garbage? never. dumbland is a wonderful picture of some americans that don't have brains and hit wife and kids for fun. from m'exico i can say i love it! my favorite episodes are: 1- my teeths are bleeding, all the noise around and violence make me wanna scream and put me behind my bed. 2- get the stick! yeah baby get it and learn a lesson: some people never be thankful for your actions. 3- ants. the more lynch episode of all, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge...
