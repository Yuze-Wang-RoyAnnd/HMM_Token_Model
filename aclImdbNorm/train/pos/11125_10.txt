what can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude? "the sopranos" has literally redefined television as we know it. it has broken all rules, and set new standards for television excellence. everything is flawless, the writing, directing, and for me, most of all, the acting. watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real. the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano, or any character. this show is also very versatile. some people don't watch the show because it's violent, it's not all about the violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see. for me, i don't like when people refer to the show, a show about the mafia. for me, it's a show about family. a family who, through generations, happen to be apart of the mob. overall this is a masterpiece of a show. this is what television should be. right here. complex characters from stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? a show that defines excellence, and dares to be different.
