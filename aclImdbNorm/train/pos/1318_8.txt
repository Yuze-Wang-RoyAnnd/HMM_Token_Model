i felt compelled to write a review for space cobra as it has received a good score of 7.3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive. a strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten anime movie. space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers. this is an old movie and the animation shows, but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm. space cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. there are few if any references to specific japanese culture and great for anime novices to watch and enjoy. space cobra himself is witty and likable. i cannot say how much of this is due to the english dub or the intentions of the maker, but this is one of the few japanese comedy characters that i find truly funny. the style is very sixties barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by yello. the style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. the strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note. i cannot think of another anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly. you barely realise that it is happening, but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural. you also really feel the characters went on a journey and they're lives were changed by the whole experience. check out if you can.
