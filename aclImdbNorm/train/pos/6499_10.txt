after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making. the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project. it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian(ken burns ?) take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone. with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original. if you are interested in this era don't miss this series. it is required viewing.
