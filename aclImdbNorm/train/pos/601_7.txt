i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot - i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. yet i remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. i definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary "edginess" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed.
