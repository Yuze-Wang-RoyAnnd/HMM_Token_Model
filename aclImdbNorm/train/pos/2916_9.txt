of all the movies i have seen, and that's most of them, this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the u.s. naval airships (blimps) during the ww-ii era. yes there are other good lta related movies, but most use special effects more than any real-time shots. this man's navy has considerably more real-time footage of blimps etc. true, lots of corny dialog but that's what makes more interesting hollywood movies, even today. p.s. i spent 10 years(out of 20) and have over 5,000 hours in navy airships of all types, from 1949 through 1959. proud member of the naval airship association etc. [atc(la/ac) usn retired]
