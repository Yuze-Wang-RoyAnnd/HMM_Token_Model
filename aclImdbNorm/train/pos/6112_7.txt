it is first and foremost a chick flick, it is a romantic comedy. there is a fair balance between the two. this particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes, i don't think any wires were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant. it isn't a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, pretty simple, good chemistry between the leads, and a fun watch. i'd like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute, but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty. i'd watch it again...with a girl.
