when i was flicking through the tv guide, and came across "twisted desire" on the movie section, i read it's description. three words caught my eye "melissa joan hart" ...i find her role in "sabrina: the teenage witch" absolutely vile, i hate those kind of programs, so i was just thinking that it was going to be a boring old, love story starring her...little did i know.<br /><br />it finally started on the television, i had my bucket ready in case i were to puke over it's cheesiness or soppiness, you know what i mean. at first, you think she's just a nice, ordinary girl who's in love, but has mean parents. then when you find out she's manipulated her boyfriend into killing her parents, so she could be with her true love, you're like "whoa". you just don't expect this sort of role for that sort of actress. she played her role very well in my opinion, i never expected her to be able to act like such a bitch, and voil`a, she did it perfectly! congrats to her, the movie was very good, i'd definitely watch it again and recommend it to others.
