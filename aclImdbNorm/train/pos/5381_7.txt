for a low budget movie this was really good. i put this well above your average action b-movie. sean and corinne delivered in this movie, and they didn't seem camera shy. watch out for the cameos of jeanne and jared. i didn't think that the producers would even consider that, but the runner-ups deserve that much. <br /><br />i'll be looking forward to more of sean and corinne's involvement in the movie entertainment industry. sean's character seemed very genuine, and sexy corinne's character was pretty hard-nosed and on point. she connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence. it was a great idea to cast billy zane as the smart and witty villain. his charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch. the chemistry between zane and sean's character was pretty good. the action sequences weren't cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie. of course there were flaws, but that comes with the territory. <br /><br />overall, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for tv. sean and corinne did a good job considering that they are newcomers to the game. i hope that jeanne, jared, and the rest of the next action star cast get their chance to also join their co-stars in entertainment success.<br /><br />final judgment: ***/****
