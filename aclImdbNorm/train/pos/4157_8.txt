this early anime movie was a rather good film that i caught once on the science fiction channel when anime was actually popular here in america and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network. i quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet. this film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie, though i would rather watch the original japanese version. americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed. this film features a young boy who boards a train called the galaxy express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot. he wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who hunts humans for fun. during the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother, a beautiful woman named matel, who as with most woman in anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero, or really bad. he goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named captain harlock who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series, so basically the galaxy express takes place in that universe. all in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending. there would be a sequel to this one, but it was not quite as good as this one, however the ending was a bit more final than it was here.
