dana andrews is one of those actors that i've probably seen in a dozen films, but who has never really registered for me. often stolid, taciturn, playing the same kinds of roles and looking somewhat like the similarly underrated glenn ford, he's an actor that takes some effort to really appreciate; but once you hit the right film....<br /><br />and this is it. preminger's moody look at new york's underbelly is as dirty and seedy as just about any 50s noir, and andrews is in his element as too-tough cop mark dixon who just doesn't know how to play the game to get ahead: he hates criminals too much to always play by the rules. early on in the film, he accidentally kills the witness to a murder involving an illegal crap game set up by a mobster who dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mobster to his kind of "justice". along the way he gets involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed (gene tierney) and also has to try to get her father off the hook for the murder.<br /><br />stunningly photographed by joseph lashelle, with hard and sparkling dialogue by ben hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and found grace in just a minute or two of time, this is another noir for the ages and might be my favorite preminger film thus far -- it's every bit as good as the more-heralded laura.
