the movie is okay, it has it's moments, the music scenes are the best of all! the soundtrack is a true classic. it's a perfect album, it starts out with let's go crazy(appropriate for the beginning as it's a great party song and very up-tempo), take me with u(a fun pop song...), the beautiful ones(a cheerful ballad, probably the closest thing to r&b on this whole album), computer blue(a somewhat angry anthem towards appolonia), darling nikki(one of the funniest songs ever, it very vaguely makes fun of appolonia), when doves cry(the climax to this masterpiece), i would die 4 u, baby i'm a star, and, of course, purple rain(a true classic, a very appropriate ending for this classic album) the movie and the album are both very good. i highly recommend them!
