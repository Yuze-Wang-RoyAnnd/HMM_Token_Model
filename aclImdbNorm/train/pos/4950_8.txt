knowing when to end a movie is just as important as casting, directing and acting. and it's nice to see when a director/script get it right. clocking in at just 82 minutes, 10 items or less doesn't stretch the story, trying to grasp at inane topics. it stays focused, being funny, sad, and well thought out.<br /><br />morgan freeman (lucky number slevin) stars as "him", an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him. we're introduced to "him" as he travels to a supermarket in an out-of-the-way section of town by the kid (jonah hill, click). realizing he has a star in his car, the kid pressures him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years. him isn't very forthcoming because, not only has he been out of it for while, he's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in ("i haven't decided if i'm going to accept the part."). the kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville. stuck, him decides to check out the local market. he immediately runs into the beautiful scarlet (paz vega) who operates the 10 items or less register. not just strikingly pretty but intelligent, him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role. he learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community.<br /><br />but him doesn't just use scarlet, he helps her so he can see deeper into her life. they travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband, and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she's pining for, and how to dress for success even when confronted with target as the epitome of local clothing. this is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of him, too, showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain-store retail world ("these shirts are only $12 bucks! how is this possible?!") the ending, as stated at the beginning of this review, is abrupt but apropos. there's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond. they know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other. it's a quiet but riveting moment as scarlet's clunker car sits idling outside him's l.a. mansion.<br /><br />this is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going. and it won't waste your time either.
