this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren't very funny and had a drama element where bill (the mother) was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didn't mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped. after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc have ever made! the chemistry between bill and ben's character's were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series. the christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for christmas. <br /><br />the show came to a stop when the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as up 'n' under and a very funny man rip<br /><br />this underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesn't to be repeated that often - though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
