ingrid bergman is a temporarily impoverished polish countess in 1900s paris who finds herself pursued by france's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history. there are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic bastille day throngs, but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. yes, it's rules of the game redux. before it's all over even gaston modot, the jealous gamekeeper in rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-french speaker, but what the heck -- elena and her men is another deeply humane renoir masterpiece.
