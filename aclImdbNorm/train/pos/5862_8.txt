there isn't a whole lot going on in this story -- just two men employing very different ways of handling memories of vietnam. but what it lacks in premise, it more than makes up for in acting and realism. it's a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience. we even get romance (not gratuitous -- just another very real piece of this story). it's well worth seeing.
