first an explanation on what makes a great movie for me. excitement about not knowing what is coming next will make me enjoy a movie the first time i watch it (case en point: twister). there are also other things that go into a great first viewing such as good humor (john candy in uncle buck and the great outdoors), good plot with good resolution (madeline and matilda), imaginative storytelling (all star wars episodes-george lucas is the man), and good music (again all star wars episodes, wizard of oz, sound of music). what makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theatre and buy a dvd or vhs tape? characters. with that said, i present cindy lou who and the grinch. excellent performance taylor momsen and jim carrey. the rest of the cast was very good, particularly jeffery tambor, bill irwin, molly shannon, christine baranski, and josh ryan evans. but, every single scene with cindy and the grinch-together is excellent and very funny and/or heartwarming. cindy lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon. the grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts, and a very good theme (i can't get started because i don't want to spoil it). jim carrey was very funny as the grinch-particularly when he interacted with cindy. and the music! wow! excellent music by james horner. i loved his selection of instruments and the compositions. very good job jim carrey-i didn't know you could sing. taylor momsen! whoa! your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once. on your solo - where are you christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds? sounds like an f#? that is an obscene range for a 7-year old (obscene meant in the best possible way). great job. this is the best performance by a child i have ever heard in a movie(taylor beat out the von trapp children-no small feat!). and now to the actors. jim carrey was great, funny, and, surprisingly very sensitive (this really showed through in his scenes with taylor momsen). taylor momsen's unspoken expressions(one of the secrets to a good acting performance) are very strong-she really becomes cindy lou who. and when she does dialogue she is even stronger.<br /><br />******************************danger:spoiler alert********************* ***********************************************************************<br /><br />examples: expression when she first sees the grinch. this is a classic quote ("you're the the the" and then filled in with the grinch line "da da da the grinch-after which she topples into the sorter and then is rescued by the grinch). the "thanks for saving me" quote and subsequent response by the grinch was also very good.<br /><br />my favorite part of the movie is when cindy invites the grinch to be holiday cheermeister. this scene is two excellent actors at their best interacting and expressing with each other. little taylor momsen completely holds her own with jim carrey in this spot. i sincerely hope we see taylor momsen in many more films to come. all in all everything was great about this movie (except maybe the feet and noses).
