pufnstuf is what it is. i saw this in the cinema at age 4 and i have very fond, and vivid, memories of it. seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - like the bit where jimmy's grey witch wig is ripped off and witch hazel (cass) sneers "i knew she had brown roots!". it is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time, and in some ways quite progressive. the track different, for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself, not running with the pack, and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different. this could be an anthem to the gay community, it should be, great track.<br /><br />martha raye, cass elliot and billie hayes are all great as witches, and the living island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits (includes billy barty, felix silla and other famous names). there is a lot of over acting in this film - there's really nothing subtle, and when little jack wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of living island it's really little more than yelling. this is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel. while i think of it - i never could stand the flute though.<br /><br />i love the soundtrack, especially the above mentioned different but also zap the world, pufnstuf and even jack wild's touching if i could. what's more, it is now out on cd from the tasteful people at el records in london. see here for more: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
