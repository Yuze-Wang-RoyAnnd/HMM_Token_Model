faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that. downbeat (in a petit-bourgeois sort of way), philosophical and blackly humorous, the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles bukowski (no disrespect to cb intended). mordantly funny, but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why aren't other films like this? one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film.
