mother night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment. instead i got a film that perfectly portrays the irony, humor, elequence, and above all else the crushing sadness of vonnegut's novel.<br /><br />this is certainly nolte's best preformance to date. he captures the defeat and selfloathing of howard cambell jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes.<br /><br />alan arkin is absolutly hilarious as george kraft. sherryl lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as cambell's young lover. john goodman is understated and more than effective as cambell's "blue fairy godmother."<br /><br />this pinnocioesque story of cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people. and aside from that, it is one of the most deeply romantic films i have ever come across. cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. and at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his blue fairy godmother grants him his wish. and he realizes that...well, watch the movie and you'll see.<br /><br />mother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made. it is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
