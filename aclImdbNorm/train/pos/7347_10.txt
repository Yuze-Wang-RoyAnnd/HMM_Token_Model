i own ralph bakshis forgotten masterpiece fire & ice on an old oop rental videotape.<br /><br /> well for one thing, this is better than any other conan-esque film you'll ever see. sure, it's cheesy, but who cares? it stood the test of time, and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like lotr:fotr (though i love that film.)<br /><br /> the plot goes like this: after a battle between fire & ice, a kings daughter is kidnapped by jarols (ice) subhuman creatures, while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues her.<br /><br /> yeah it doesn't sound as a original as nurse betty, but that's not the point. it is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies: fire & ice. and it succeeds.<br /><br /> as for the action scenes: superb. they are well handled, have terrific suspence, and have plenty of loud noises. just check out the climatic battle, now that's an ending!<br /><br /> the acting and dialogue: competent. really. they aren't gonna be nominated for an oscar, but they are ok and don't get on your nerves.<br /><br /> the animation is quite good. shot on 3d and rotoscoped (i think), it looks pretty good. a lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn, and although the character designs feel a little 1-dimentional, they are ok.<br /><br /> overall, this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfical "entertainment". 10/10
