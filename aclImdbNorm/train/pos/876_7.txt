a super, unusual film from audiard, read my lips is a pulpy, lonely- hearts thriller. it's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos. devos is a recurring feature of audiard in the same way that karin viard pops up for jean-pierre jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile.<br /><br />this is almost the definition of her role as carla, a put-upon office dogsbody, taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness. yet she finds an ami d'exploitation, if you like in cassel's ex-con paul. each exploits the other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement. devos/audiard manage carla's deafness and its attendant, warped inner world with discreet, stylish flair.<br /><br />in this film (2001) audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension, action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit - a prophet - of nine years later. 7/10
