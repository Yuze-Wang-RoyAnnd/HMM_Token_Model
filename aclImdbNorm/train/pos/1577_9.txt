spoilers within.<br /><br />it appears that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film versprechen, das (1995).<br /><br />the direction seemed carefully controlled, and visually i felt it was highly appealing - especially where the visual narrative was concerned (the title-sequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters in the past).<br /><br />to clarify two points that many people have been confused by:<br /><br />firstly, lena did not sleep with goebbels. although this may have seemed implied, it was not the intent. von trotta told me so herself! (and she is a very nice lady, by the way!)<br /><br />secondly, the time-frame of events was in fact historically accurate (the actual dates are shown on the close-up of the memorial) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film. there is evidence showing that goebbels was annoyed about having done this, and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free.<br /><br />overall, what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much 'over-movied' era. it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time (for various reasons) for this film to hit our screens.<br /><br />more of the same please, margarethe!
