here is the explanation screenwriter pamela katz gave me for why mvt introduced jg as a specific character in the film:<br /><br />"...the historical record is very clear: joseph goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed a way to get goebbels himself into our film... for a woman like lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top. the idea of getting to goebbels wasn't impossible for her, so that became our hook."<br /><br />those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below & then fire away.<br /><br />jan lisa huttner films for two
