i really liked the movie. i remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book.<br /><br />i was kid-sitting for a boy and a girl, ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie. but happily, at the end, she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on dvd as soon as it came out.<br /><br />there were some great laugh-out-loud moments and the movie was not as "gross" as i expected it would be ... tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross-o-meter ...<br /><br />the only thing i cannot figure out is why they had to have the "dilly" line in there that was done by woody in reference to his private part ... that to me was the only shocker moment (and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie) ... i have no clue why that was put in the movie; it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock/gasp factor ... other than that, a pretty good movie. nice to see the "pepsi" girl all grown up.
