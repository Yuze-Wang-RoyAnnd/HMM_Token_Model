yes, i did, as i sit here red-faced, remembering having felt almost guilty as i watched it a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to watch something as inconsequential (in comparison) as "mommie dearest."<br /><br />how does one explain the appeal of "batman and robin" - i mean the only ones who ever really counted, adam west and burt ward. it was a terrible show, with terrible plots and terrible acting - and, oh yes, it was terribly funny! and the same applies to this "reunion" and "flashback" movie. adam and burt are invited to an auction where the old batmobile is going to be sold off for charity. but it gets stolen, and our pals (as themselves) jump into their old characters' personas (if not their costumes) and head off to find out what's happened. along the way they reminisce about the series, and we see how it all came together in flashbacks, with jack brewer and jason marsden playing the young adam and burt of the tv series. it really was quite interesting to get some behind the scenes looks at the old series, and adam and burt just stepped perfectly back into character (even though they weren't really in character - well, you'd have to watch it to see what i mean.) it was also great to see julie newmar and frank gorshin.<br /><br />if you're not a fan of the old series, you'll hate this. if - heaven forbid - you actually thought michael keaton and george clooney made acceptable "batmans" then you'll hate this even more. but if you grew up with adam and burt and are still willing to admit that you never missed an episode - well, this one's for you.<br /><br />yes, it's true - 9/10
