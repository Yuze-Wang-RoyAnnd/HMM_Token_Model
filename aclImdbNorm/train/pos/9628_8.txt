some of my favorite laurel and hardy films have very, very little plot. instead, they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious! films such as help mates and busy bodies are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house. here in dirty work, most of the film is akin to these other two films--stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying (quite unsuccessfully) to clean a crazy professor's chimney. seeing ollie fall through the chimney, the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film.<br /><br />however, in an odd twist, there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie. it seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger. late in the film, you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg! given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room, is it any surprise what happens next? while this subplot was unnecessary, it worked well enough. what worked exceptionally well was the middle portion. give the boys nothing exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results. one of the team's better films and it almost earns a 9.
