i am a sucker for films like this. films that take you back and let you relive your childhood. i'm a grown up now and have many grown up responsibilities like a mortgage, kids, dogs, a wife and a slew of others. i enjoy my life but it is not as innocent and carefree like it was when i was twelve. mike binder's indian summer knows this and explores this like he was twelve years old. it brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun. it brings you back to a time when worrying about your first kiss and wondering if you could finish the camp marathon were important issues. indian summer is a fantastic film and it is one that should be watched at least once a year just so you can sit back and laugh...and reminisce.<br /><br />the film stars kevin pollak, bill paxton, diane lane and matt craven (to name a few) as childhood friends that are being summoned back to camp tamakwa by their former head camp counsellor, uncle lou. uncle lou is played perfectly by alan arkin. he is kind of guy who is the patriarch of the group. he is also all knowing and encompasses the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life. he has a hard time relating to today's kids that need a walkman blaring in their ears when they are at a place of immense beauty like tamakwa. this is a camp that has moose wandering through the camp, leaves turning colours that god gave them and water for as far as the eye can see. uncle lou yearns for the days of old and asks his former campers back to the camp to see one of them will take over the camp. while they are all together again, we get to see their trials and tribulations and perhaps a new love could spring between them.<br /><br />as the adults return to the camp, it isn't long before they act like kids again as the typical camp pranks get played all over again. they take toilet paper out of the stalls, the put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. all of this is done hilariously and with actors like pollak and paxton, it is all very funny stuff.<br /><br />but beyond the hilarity, we get to explore some very real adult emotion that anyone can relate to. in one of my favourite scenes, kevin pollak and elizabeth perkins are overlooking a bay where they used to go canoing as kids. pollak can't get over how small it all looks and perkins finally tells him that the bay didn't get smaller, they just got bigger. it doesn't hammer the point home, but it does it subtly. we all grow up, we all move on and we all unfortunately can't live like we did 20 years ago. the more things change, the more they stay the same.<br /><br />indian summer is a character driven film and it is written beautifully by mike binder who actually did attend camp camp tamakwa, (as did sam raimi, who played stick in the film) and it is his fond and vivid memories of his experiences that fuel the film. there are many touching scenes and there are many hilarious ones also. both are perfect.<br /><br />i love this film. i love everything about it and it is a true hidden gem.<br /><br />10/10
