when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess(2008), but when i saw the first 30 minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie. almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot.<br /><br />the only thing that really let me down are the performances. emily blunt(the devil wears prada) is the star of the film, bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance. rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt. paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him. jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.<br /><br />to me the film feels like unfinished. maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script, i don't know but that's how i feel about the movie.<br /><br />but overall it's a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt.
