rated pg-13 for violence, brief sexual humor and drug content. quebec rating:13+(should be g) canadian home video rating:14a<br /><br />i have seen police story a couple of times now.in my opinion police story is chan's best film from the 80's.he originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was the protector.i have not seen the protector so i cant compare.the acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good.i don't remember the plot well because i saw this film a while back but what i do remember is this film has lots of great action,stunts and comedy just what a good chan film needs.if you can find police story and you are chan fan then buy this film! <br /><br />runtime:106min <br /><br />9/10
