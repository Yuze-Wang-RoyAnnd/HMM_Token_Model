since educating rita, julie walters has been one of my role models, and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves get in synch with his feminine side is magnificent. i would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress, but walters pulls it off with gusto and panache. adrian pasdar gives his best performance to-date in the male lead.
