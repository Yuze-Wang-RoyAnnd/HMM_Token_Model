i look at this page, and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic. sure, i agree to let everyone have their opinion, but here's mine:<br /><br />this movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher, and should be seen many casual viewers around the world. sure, it has lost some of it's flair and greatness with age, especially in todays world of cgi effects, but that's not why you should like it.<br /><br />you should like it because it actually is a scary movie, even for today's standards. it's overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences, so don't slam a classic if you haven't given it a chance. watch it, but not with a critical attitude. watch it to have fun, how it was originally intended.
