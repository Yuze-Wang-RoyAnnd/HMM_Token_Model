what a relief to find out i am not imagining this programme! the summary from taxman is great. i too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing, i must have been 10/11 at the time i watched it. i think for a girl that age part of attraction was lead's very blond hair, and his permanently sad state. the theme was played on a flute i recall - although i cannot remember how it went. i think the intro showed him playing it - or maybe he played a flute in the programme and especially when he was sad? maybe i am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune, but at least i now know it is not just me.
