father of the pride is a pleasant surprise: it is funny, witty and features some great voice acting. the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried & roy shows. indeed all of them are stereotypes but that's what makes them so funny. fotp is not a kiddie-cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way. it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed. i'd say i'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original, i've seen most of those stereotypes many times before, even in that particular order!
