la teta i la luna (the breast and the moon) describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy named tete who is obsessed with breasts growing up in catalunya. i love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in bigas luna's movies (also director of jamon, jamon). tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age. also being from catalunya (north-east of spain) it brought lots of memories to my mind. this movie shows how beautiful catalunya is, nice people, nice life and specially lots of non-uptight people.
