i wasn't going to watch this show. but, i'm glad i did. the critics of this just don't get it! it's one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on t.v at the present moment! though, when the interviews were done with common folks they probably seemed useless; but, put them in the mouth of animals and insects, and it's a laugh riot. i laughed so hard, i had tears in my eyes. the pig with the babies suckling and her mother is priceless. the husband and wife birds talking about health problems, and the male bird taking a crap after the wife said she was constipated completely broke me up! creature comforts is the most imaginative show i've ever seen in awhile! hopefully, it will be back next summer when this run is over.
