it has been 16 years since it's original run, i would have hoped by now some "marketing wizard" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. i can't fathom why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up. galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots, and even better scripts.the animation was above average quality for it's time, and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today. it predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, this may have sealed it's doom too. i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available.
