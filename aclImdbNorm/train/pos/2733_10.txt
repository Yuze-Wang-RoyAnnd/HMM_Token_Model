the premise to this movie was one which focused on the polarization of of ideologies in the united states.. this was a highly combustible scenario in america whereby two entirely different cultures collided. what justified such heinously depraved actions anyway?.. as this film presents the scene,(while hickock and smith drank) these two men were not intoxicated, nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs!! it was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation.. basically, these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect... anytime past 1975, we as a nation have nurtured an empathy for deviates who have been victimized by their environment... however, this incident takes place in 1959!! this dreadful revelation sideswiped us, and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics!! with the recent release of the movie "capote" based on truman capote, who was the creator of the documentary "in cold blood", the american people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film!! robert blake played the role of perry smith, one of the villains in this movie... this is seemingly appropriate given the notoriety he has been involved with concerning his personal life!! "in cold blood" centers on the element of the unexplained... there was no vengeance involved, there was no material gain to be acquired, there was no potential for social advancement here either, this is merely an instance of a latent and insidiously belligerent anger which ends certainly did not justify the means!! the situational diatribes which hickock and smith lamented about were always ambiguous!! under the circumstances, why then should they take their frustrations out on an anonymously unsuspecting and innocent kansas family?.. will geer (grandpa walton) plays the prosecuting attorney who is sickened by this act of macabre capriciousness!! his argument is thoroughly convincing... his contention being: "these two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours" this is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if i were to be one of the members of the jury!! absolute disdain for your precarious plight in life does not serve as vindication for orchestrating a capital crime!! it was capote's instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the american public's attention!! as it turn out, it was a harbinger of things to come.. "in cold blood" did just that!! this incident was the calm before the storm relating to a pertinent aspect of emergence to the radical 1960's!! such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical americans for the future!!!<br /><br />truman capote does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book, (which was a best seller) and, with this documentary as well... the acting in this film by robert blake and scott wilson, as well as people like john forsythe, was incredible!! the director, richard brooks, ("cat on a hot tin roof", "blackboard jungle" "elmer gantry" and "key largo" to name but a few!!) was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie!! i think that "in cold blood" is one of the best films in the history of movies!! the film depicts two reprehensible spawns of depravity who delved into demented theatrics, and wound up captivating a trite gratification for being acknowledged at a pejorative nationwide level!!.... this movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence!! our nation's ideologies are incredibly different now, than they were in 1959!! this movie introduces the american people to the emotional and vacillating culprits who initiated such a precarious metamorphosis in our overall value system!! i recommend to everyone that they see this movie..."in cold blood" was the focal point to the film "capote"! think about it, making a movie about a movie constitutes a rare and coveted accolade in hollywood!! in the case of "in cold blood" it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant, intellectually elevating, and, of course, it goes without saying, "in cold blood" was utterly spellbinding, as well as a totally remarkable movie!!
