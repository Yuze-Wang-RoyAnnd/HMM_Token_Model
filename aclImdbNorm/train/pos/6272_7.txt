<br /><br />i saw once no man's land (1987) - imdb link http://us.imdb.com/title?0093638 - and found it ok. the film is about a guy who steals only porsches. gone in sixty seconds comes 13 years after and adds nothing to it. in fact, it has a lot of scenes that are worthless. and the ending is very, very bad.<br /><br />the sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used...
