okay, so there is a front view of a checker taxi, probably late 1930s model. it has the great triangular shaped headlights. there also is a desoto cab in this black and white, character driven, almost a musical love gone wrong story.<br /><br />the real pleasure here is the look at 1940s room interiors and fashions and hotel elevators. the hair styles, male and female are gorgeous. if dolly parton had victor mature's hair she could have made it big. there is an artist loft that would be the envy of every andy warhol wannabe.<br /><br />if you watch this expecting a great casablanca storyline or sound of music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. there is a nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this film.<br /><br />my copy on dvd with another movie for $1 was very viewable. the title sequence was cute but not up there with mad, mad, mad, mad world or the pink panther. this was an rko movie but it did not have the nice airplane logo that rko used to use.<br /><br />i liked victor mature in one million, b.c., and sampson and delilah and especially in violent saturday. see if you can find that one. he was wonderful in the comedy with peter sellers called caccia alla volpe or after the fox.<br /><br />richard carlson went on to do i led three lives on tv in the early 1950s.<br /><br />vic mature was offered the part of sampson's father in the remake of sampson and delilah. he supposedly was asked if he would have any problems playing the part of the father since he was so well known as sampson. victor replied, "if the money is right, i'll play sampson's mother." <br /><br />tom willett
