no, this isn't a sequel to the fabulous ova series, but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of ghim (and the disappearance of woodchuck). it is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series, which is why characters (namely orson and shiris) are reintroduced, and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the ova. (the booklet included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions, as do various online sites.) the first eight episodes of this 27-part tv series focus on the fateful battle at demon dragon mountain. the remaining 19 episodes introduce us to spark, a blue-haired knight wannabe who identifies with parn, and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the dark wizard wagnard from resurrecting kardis the destroyer.<br /><br />while it isn't quite the equivalent of the original lodoss war (we all love the finale where parn saves deedlit from wagnard, don't we?), this tv follow-up is still great fun for fantasy fans. even if the animation is limited (and a step down from the artistic streak of the first lodoss), this 27-part series has its elements of appeal. the fully-realized characters, engaging storyline, magic, romance, and a superb soundtrack scored by kaoru wada of ninja scroll, all give this uneven spin-off some punch.<br /><br />while the ova dub of lodoss has been criticized for one reason or another, i generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite dubs. so i had significant hopes for the dub for chronicles, made in 1999-2000. for the most part, the lodoss tv english track is of passable (if not stellar) quality; it does, however, have its share of problems. much of the original cast who lent their english voices to the characters of lodoss return (including lisa ortiz as deedlit!), which is a nice bonus. on the other hand, billy regan's more mature sounding parn is a bit offputting. he doesn't do a bad job, but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes (causing some anti-dub fans to instantly diss the dub), but by the time spark and company take the stage, i found it less bothersome. (i don't know if it's because he improved or if it just grew on me.) also, not everyone from the oav dub returns. jayce reeves only voices wagnard (terrifically) for one episode; he's replaced by pete zarustica for the whole show, who gives a scratchy, but still malevolent turn (as well as the expected evil laughter). anthony cruise's kashue, on the other hand, is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride. oliver gregory is probably the most effective as orson, especially during his final dramatic scenes.<br /><br />aside from lisa ortiz (deedlit), karen smith (shiris), john knox (ashram), and al muscari (slayn), the dub's best voices come from some of the newer characters, including crispin freeman (spark, maar, garrack -episodes 16-27-), roxanne beck (little neese), meg frances (who voices pirotess in the oav but also voices ryna with vulnerability and sassiness as well as karla) and especially angora deb (who steals every scene she's in as leaf the half-elf). the rest of the cast isn't terrible by any means, but a little more uneven than the oav dub. some are all right (aldonova, greevus) while others are lackluster (hobb, palace guards, dragons, etc.) and few were awful (in particular, prince reona's va is too harsh and monotone for a fighter of justice).<br /><br />in fact the lack of aural continuity (some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes) is one of the problems of the dub. others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue, uneven synchronization, and finally (i apologize in advance to the fans of this) the lodoss island segments. these offbeat, super-deformed interludes at the end of each episode will either amuse or drive you batty. admittingly, i at first found them to be a major nuisance, but they sorta grew on me after a while. (besides, there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as "i'm king kashue, and this is my cashew! i'm really quite a nut!") these flaws rank the dub for chronicles just a notch just below that for the ova, resulting in an uneven english track summed up best as "ok".<br /><br />if one wonders if the japanese language track is the preferred listening choice, well, guess what? the japanese version has its good and bad points, too. while some voices are less annoying than the english language track, i found others to be less appealing than the english equivalents (in particular, the actress who does deedlit is nowhere nearly as good as lisa ortiz or yumi tohma). plus, i should mention that the japanese cast is not the same as the ova. because the series was made seven years after the original, all but one (sho hayami) of the cast members are replaced by new ones. although they do a respectably good job, it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the japanese ova cast. shows that not everything in japanese is better than english, eh? despite its flaws, chronicles of the heroic knight is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground. its not without its rough spots and doesn't always live up to its predecessor, yet there's enough good points to counter the bad, making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy anime.
