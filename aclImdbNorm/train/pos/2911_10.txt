this is one of the finest music concerts anyone will ever see and hear. i grew up when all my lovin' was brand new and to hear it again today by the original artist today is a measure of sir p mc's power to spellbind any crowd of any age. this doco goes way behind the scenes to show us life on the road not just for the band but everyone down to the roadies. i saw this guy live in aussie 1975 and can assure you his performance here on this dvd is no less than he gave almost 30 years ago. i have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that does do this justice and would recommend this anyone especially a beatles fan. this is the closest you will get to a beatles concert today. singer, songwriter, lead/rhythm/ bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. there are few entertainers who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in his hand. if you want note perfect music, buy a studio recorded cd. if you want to hear raw music as it is intended and spontaneous to the crowd, with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd-this dvd is for you.
