it's not a big film. the acting is not amazing (some sub charterers are even played badly), the film is not beautiful in any sense. nothing really inventive or new. if you like big films, this one is not for you. yet it has a big - really big plus on the story. larry's story works, because we know this story from our own lives. the girl we didn't ask to a date, the test we've failed, the friend we let down, are all in our history. this movie works, because it touch it, it's a great story because it's a small one. it's the life we all have, with regrets we all have, and yet the message hits: every life we could have lived would have had their downside. the first time i watched it, i was 15. it was shown in a party at my school. 16 years later, i keep reflecting on it every once in a while, and every time i see it, it puts a smile on my face. watch it. it will do you good. you'll be happier with what you have.
