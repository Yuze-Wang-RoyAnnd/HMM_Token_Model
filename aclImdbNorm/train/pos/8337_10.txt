being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and therefore having seen a large number of these films, it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique. for that matter, it is equally rare that i am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes. the love story is a little thin on the ground, but i'd say that's probably for the best, as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on "comedy", and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than i like most rom com's to do. the four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film, but in any film i've seen in a long while. i hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a "10" over a "9" as a rating, as i believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact. i'm also a big meg ryan fan, which helps, but this is one of the few films i've seen in which i'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed. she and tim robbins are cast as the leads, but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals. a genuine laugh-out-loud type film.
