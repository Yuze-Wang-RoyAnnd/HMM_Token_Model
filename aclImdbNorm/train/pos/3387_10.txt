truly amazing film, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening. a world vastly overpopulated, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer, and all our natural resources spent. in this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great charlton heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder, opposite the film noir legend edward g robinson turning in a fine last performance.<br /><br />one of the images that will always stay with me from this film, is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which thorne (heston) has to hop through them every time he uses them.<br /><br />the movie's use of music is note worthy too, although it contains no score in the usual sense, the opening theme is good, and the subsequent snatches of music we here in simonson's apartment, and especially the beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric.
