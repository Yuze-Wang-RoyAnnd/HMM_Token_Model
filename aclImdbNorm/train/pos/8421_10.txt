josef von sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent hollywood and the former imperial general to the czar of russia who has found himself there. emil jannings won a well-deserved oscar, in part, for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a russian general. the movie flashes back to his days in russia leading up to the country's fall to revolutionaries. william powell makes his big screen debut as the hollywood director who casts jannings in his film. the film serves as an interesting look at the fall of russia and at an imitation of behind-the-scenes tinseltown in the early days. von sternberg delivers yet another classic, and one that is filled with the great elements of romance, intrigue, and tragedy.
