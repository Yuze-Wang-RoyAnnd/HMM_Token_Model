simon pegg plays the part of sidney young, a young entertainment writer who has begun the beginnings of a career writing for a grassroots magazine that specializes in badmouthing the shallowness and superficiality of the rich and famous. he is making a career out of lampooning celebrities, although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself. the movie is based on the very bizarre career of toby young, who also ran a small magazine in britain called the modern review, which offered scathing criticism of pretty much everything imaginable, until he closed the magazine in a hail of verbal bullets with his co-editor, and then went on to a spectacularly failed career as a writer for vanity fair, which is pretty much the part of his life told in this movie. <br /><br />he is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication (called sharp's magazine in the movie), and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day. he meets the chief editor, clayton harding (played by jeff bridges), who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goof-off like young to keep his job at the magazine. he offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of young, but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of young's off-the-wall antics and inappropriate behavior. <br /><br />much of the comedy in the movie is derived from young's misunderstanding of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous. but sidney's reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews is because he believes that he loathes the entire celebrity culture and, it would seem, he believes in that age-old saying
