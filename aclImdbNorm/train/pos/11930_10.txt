this film was pretty good. i am not too big a fan of baseball, but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc.<br /><br />danny glover, joseph gordon-levitt, brenda fricker, christopher lloyd, tony danza, and milton davis jr. are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport. the plot was believable, and i love the message. william dear and the guys put together a great movie.<br /><br />most sports films revolve around true stories or events, and they often do not work well. but this film hits a 10 on the perfectness scale, even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there.<br /><br />10/10
