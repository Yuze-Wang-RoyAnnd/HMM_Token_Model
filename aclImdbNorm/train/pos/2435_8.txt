i never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes! when i first purchased casper & friends: spooking about africa, i so much wanted to see the very first casper cartoon entitled the friendly ghost (1945), but when i saw the next cartoon, there's good boos to-night (1948), it made me break down! i couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing casper's fox get killed! i never saw anything like that in the other casper cartoons! this is the saddest one of all! it was so depressing, i just couldn't watch it again. it's just like seeing lassie die at the end of a movie. i know it's a classic,but it's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me! if i wanted to watch something old and classic, i rather watch something happy and funny! but when i think about this casper cartoon, i think about my cats!
