the characters were alive and interesting, the plot was excellently paced, the pyro effects were masterfully accomplished, and it takes a basic love triangle story and tosses in a science-fiction element into it. i could identify with many of the characters and their motivations made logical rational sense in the framework of the story.<br /><br />the camera-work was great, the audio clear and accurate, the background music perfectly chosen for effect, the singing firemen a nice talented memorable oddity, the sets brilliantly crafted, and the special effects performed with a skilled talent.<br /><br />i am a tad puzzled how an entire mini-carnival in a chain-store's parking lot could be powered by one single lamppost outlet. that seems impossible to say the least. the fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though. having jim varney in a non-clown role was a wonderful touch too as played the semi-serious role of a carny very well.
