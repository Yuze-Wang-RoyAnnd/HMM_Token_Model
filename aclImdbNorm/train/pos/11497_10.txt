this is one of the very few movies out there which are very erotic without being pornographic, despite there being only a very rudimentary plot. there's not much live sound or dialogue; instead, the actors do voice-overs describing their experience, why they participated, etc.<br /><br />it's a document.<br /><br />it's mind-blowing.<br /><br />i can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this. there already is something like this. this. :-)<br /><br />nb: the producer doesn't have the rights to distribute a dvd version. i've also never seen it being sold anywhere; one may email mr. boerner and order a copy on vhs.
