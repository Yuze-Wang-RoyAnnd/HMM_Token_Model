alive<br /><br />alive is a very entertaining sci-fi movie from japan. i have noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who loved versus this director's debut film or his third film azumi. i have heard they are blood drenched films with swords and zombies and all kinds of goodies. frankly i went to the video store to get versus but i am just fine with alive.<br /><br />if you are looking for beginning to end wall to wall action then alive is not your pick. there is plenty of action however it comes as pay-off for a whole hour of character driven build-up. personally i think it is well done and worth it.<br /><br />of course some of the plot is silly as with many sci-fi action films and i think the subtitles using the term foreign object could have replaced with parasite for greater effect. this film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply.<br /><br />they kept the budget down by for the most part confining all the action to one underground building(taking a cue from the cube) but the film doesn't suffer for it. another bonus for this film is intense gothic imagines that are done with great artistic flair during the many flashbacks and dream sequences. <br /><br />rent this!
