<br /><br /> i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same. mainly because of my feelings at the end. i and all the people around me were simply touched. this is something you don't often feel . we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films. the story of the film centres around jane a young woman in the last stages of mnd and the friendship that grows between her and richard, a man on the verge of a breakdown. this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous, humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie. <br /><br />the acting from branagh and bonham-carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role. the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie. <br /><br />the title comes from richards masterpiece, a plane made of junk and his old paintings. flying here is a symbol for both richards and janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end. <br /><br />a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone. don't let the subject matter put you off.
