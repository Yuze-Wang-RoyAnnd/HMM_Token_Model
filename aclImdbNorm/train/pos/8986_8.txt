anton newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject. watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent. he thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting. the dw are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise. "hey, do you haver a drivers license?" ,anton says to the cameraman, "well lets go pawn this guitar!". great use of archive/ home video material. great to see rock docs still being made. a cool doc about the creative process. if you like this go see nirvana live! tonight! sold out! on dvd. a good experience anton is this film. 8 out of 10
