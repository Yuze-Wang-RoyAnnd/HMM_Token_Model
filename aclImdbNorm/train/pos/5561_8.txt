ok, needless to say, this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience; namely stoners and like-minded people.<br /><br />that being said, if you are one of these aformentioned people, this film is a must. in fact, i think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong. what monty python's holy grail is to geeks and nerds, so is this movie to potheads. i first saw this film 10 years ago or so, and i still crack up every time i watch it. the jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle, far better than latter day knockoffs like half-baked attempt to.<br /><br />there isn't a plot, so to speak; the film is more of a collection of various skits; as the films protagonists wander around los angeles in their legendary haze. despite this, the film has an excellent sense of pace, and doesn't drag at all. many people cite up in smoke as c&c's best work, but i would have to say that next movie is superior.<br /><br />so if you're in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs, light up, tune in, and let your mind float away =)<br /><br />oh, and free tommy chong!
