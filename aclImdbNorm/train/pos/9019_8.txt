not wishing to give *anything* away here, i would just say this technically excellent, flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half's entertainment: it will amuse, surprise, possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clich'ed or predictable in any way. most definitely recommended.<br /><br />a previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both branagh and bonham-carter's outstanding performances - i agree entirely....
