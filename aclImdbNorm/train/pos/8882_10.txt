john singleton's finest film, before blockbuster wannabees like the shaft remake, this is a thought-provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories 3 main characters, each with identifiable youngster problems.<br /><br />what i liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks, a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social-economical problems and racism by whites. this movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist.<br /><br />the masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow. it's not just about racism, but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world (college), date rape, discovering sexuality and isolation. omar epps, michael rapaport and kristy swanson each deliver fine performances, and the supporting cast is equally interesting with jennifer connelly as a lez (yay) and with ice cube and busta rhymes as college bums causing little riots.<br /><br />the only negative is the caricature of a professor by laurence fishburne ("peppermint?"). surely, plenty of professors are nutty. but they're not as flat. the skinheads are also a bit of a caricature, but i guess they are like that too in real life.<br /><br />overall a great underrated piece of filmwork, if you liked american history x you'll love this one.<br /><br />8,5 out of 10
