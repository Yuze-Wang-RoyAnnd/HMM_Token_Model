ghosts that still walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, especially when you see it as a child. seeing the film as an adult, you have to admit it isn't really all that scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes (especially the ones with the creepy mummy)<br /><br />one of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new rv; the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary. also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother's secret is pretty frightening.<br /><br />okay, the acting in the film isn't all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring, but overall ghosts that still walk is fun. too bad only a few people saw this film, this film really deserves better. i just wanna say: mr. flocker, you've done a good job! and for all you hollywood producers out there; if you want to remake a movie, remake this one!
