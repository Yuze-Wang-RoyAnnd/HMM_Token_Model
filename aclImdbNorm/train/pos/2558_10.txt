i married a japanese woman 14 years ago. we're still together.<br /><br />however in the 1950's it would never have been as easy.<br /><br />life in the military had been mined for action, drama, and comedy for years by this point. mined to death. the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover. this is old hat today, but then...? marrying an asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort. this touched on both possibilities along with the third. maybe it is love? <br /><br />brando did his usual good job. garner did a better job than he usually does. he's good, but this showed how good he could be. umecki-chan had a helluva debut here and while i think she earned her statue, she didn't really stretch. it was a role that no one who hadn't been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker.<br /><br />the real scene stealer was red buttons. red was the best thing in this film. bank on it. and the japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as well.<br /><br />a classic.
