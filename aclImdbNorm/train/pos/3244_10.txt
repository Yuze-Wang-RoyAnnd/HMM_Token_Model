i couldn't agree more with nomad 7's and i a hvr's comments. a perfect laid back sunday morning movie. the humor is subtle (exact opposite of "slapstick" as one misguided commenter noted).<br /><br />but what always ceases to amaze me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over. i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend previews(hbo maybe?). had never heard of it previously. don't know why it wasn't marketed that well. ?? when dvd's were released en mass, it was one of the first movies i replaced. a great combination of cast and writing. plus, the back drop of montana wilderness doesn't hurt things either (beautiful).<br /><br />it's probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is? if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley, this probably won't be your cup of tea. this movie needs your full attention. the humor is mostly in the dialog.<br /><br />i believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th. but i still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off, i'm going to loose it (ed o'neill's face is priceless!). recommended 110%.
