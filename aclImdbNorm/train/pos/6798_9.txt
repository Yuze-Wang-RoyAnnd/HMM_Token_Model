(no spoilers, just plot details) i can't understand such hatred for this episode. you want to watch a bad episode of smallville? watch subterranean - now there's a sack of crap. tom welling gives a good performance (i don't say that very often), and michael rosenbaum is great, but he is most of the time. the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic. the martian manhunter, who previously appeared in "static", returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone, and if clark wants to return to his universe, he must kill him. an overall great episode, with good acting and a decent pace.
