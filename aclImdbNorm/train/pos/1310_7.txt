**spoilers** highly charge police drama about a serial killer loose in and around the small town of riverside wisconsin. who's being tracked down by the local police using policewoman gina pulasky, helen hunt,as an undercover decoy to catch him. <br /><br />nothing new in this made for tv movie that you haven't seen before but the depth of the acting and screenplay is unusually good and brings out a lot about not only the killer but the policewoman's, as well as her fellow policeman lover, state of mind.<br /><br />having been put under psychiatric care after shooting an armed and unstable assailant, who attacked her partner with a rifle. officer palusky is given the task to go undercover to get close to murder suspect kayle timler, steven webber. after he was positively identified by the little girl sahsa, kim kluznick,who saw him not far from where little timmy curtis was found stabbed, 18 times, to death the next day.<br /><br />getting a job at the mr. "c" diner where tim works gina gets to become very friendly with him and later tells him, in order to get tim to open up, about him possibly being the serial murderer that she once killed in a hit-and-run accident a 79 year old woman. <br /><br />tim who is said to have a genius iq doesn't seem to pick up on gina's attempt to trap him even when he later sees her at a bowling alley with her fellow cops spending a night out. playing some weird cat and mouse game with her tim at one point get's gina, at knife point, to admit that she's wired. but gina tells him that she was forced to do it by the police to get a break and an early release from prison. besides tim's instability and criminal actions we find out that gina isn't all there as well.she seems to be suffering from her being rejected by her father who left her, with a drunk and abusing mother, as a young girl that's effecting her work as an undercover policewoman. <br /><br />there's also the fact that gina's lover policeman will mccaid (jeff fahey), who's estranged from his wife and two kids, who's also on the serial murder case is too overprotective of her. that causes gina to almost blow her cover and that has her later being taken off her assignment. <br /><br />put back on undercover duty by her boss capt. cheney (dan conway), over the objections of officer mccaid, after another young boy, 12 year-old davy marish,was found murdered gina finally get's herself together and gets tim to admit that he's the person who's responsible for the string of murders in the area. gina does it by having a hidden tape recorder that she replaced the one that she gave to him to show how honest she is, hidden on her.<br /><br />the movie "in the company of darkness" wasn't really that exceptional but the acting by helen hunt jeff fahey and especially steven webber was. it was these high caliber performances that lifted the film well above the average made for tv movie were used to seeing.
