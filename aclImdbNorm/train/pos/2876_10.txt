the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles perrault, with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in 1959; this film is a sweet, enchanting masterpiece from disney.<br /><br />the film has a great soundtrack; that's one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack, and i love the songs too; my favorite song is the romantic "so this is love." i love the mice from the film too, they are cute. my favorite scene is the scene after the narration, the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning; i also love it when cinderella's animal friends (the mice and birds) fix up cinderella's birth-mother's dress, so she could go to the ball...until drizella & anastasia tore it to bits, the b****es!
