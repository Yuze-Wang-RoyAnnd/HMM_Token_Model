the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival, i thought it intriguing, fascinating, the sensitive bi-sexual artist. so very european, so very dutch! i recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious-sexual orientation persecution complex. get a grip! this guy is a freeloader, living off of society. i suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy-nightmares about the "spiderwoman" is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year's of ignoring mother's advice about getting into cars (and bed) with strangers! not only is he making outrageous sums of (probably taxfree) loot for making up stories (lying guilt trip) but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut, hence he hustles the beauty salon owner. then he has the nerve to complain about the bill! but i also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made. on a serious note it was entertaining to see some of jan de bont's camera work and one of paul verhoeven's earlier films. hmmm, maybe the world hasn't changed so very much after all?
