i love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years. it does get better with every viewing. i agree with all of the positive reviews here. yes, it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days. i found myself doing commentary as i watched it. someone on here said rip torn was miscast. i couldn't disagree more. he is brilliant as the dour, miserly clyde stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. conchatta farrell is fantastic as the widowed elinor, whom clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter). lilia skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma. also a star is the stark montana prairie. it is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle. there are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. no special effects here, what you see is real! it even has a terrificly perfect music score and a great script. once you see heartland, you'll never forget it. it deserves all the 10s it gets here.
