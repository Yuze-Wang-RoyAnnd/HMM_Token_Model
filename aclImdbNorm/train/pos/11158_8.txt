shocking, well-made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces.<br /><br />small town doctor tries to discover who, or what, is committing a series of violent sexual murders.<br /><br />incubus is a tight mystery, with some horrific murder sequences, that builds to an off-beat and eerie climatic twist. the murder scenes are intense and gory, so this isn't a film for the squeamish! the direction of john hough, along with a bizarre music score, combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film. it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well. nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight.<br /><br />the cast isn't bad either. the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town. also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter, helen hughes as the town historian, and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen.<br /><br />all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated.<br /><br />*** out of ****
