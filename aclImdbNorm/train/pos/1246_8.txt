the premise may seem goofy, but since murphy's character doesn't take it seriously, it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modern-day hard-boiled child abduction. excellent cast, particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis, and murphy is at the height of his 80's peak in comedy/action. there's also some great f/x, a very surreal dream sequence, and a fairly original plot. often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks, but this one is worth a look.
