my girlfriend and i have a thing for robots. so i try to seek out movies that have robots. and this movie has robots. big ones. they beat the clang and bang out of each other, with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. it's really cool. you have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. it is very hard to dislike this movie. because of those big robots. they looked like transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers! it made my girlfriend smile. and that is good enough for me. and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul koslo: as the maniacal russian villain, whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste "like blood" (a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-bela lugosi accent) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen. this is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation.
