the scene where sally field and whoopi goldberg go to the mall to revive sally's flagging spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie, but wait! there's more! this is a crackling good sendup of daytime tv, movie stars on the way down, (and up) and the horrors of love. robert downey jr shows the lighter side of his genius, and cathy moriarty is splendid. the dialogue is witty, and the physical humor done with consummate skill. this is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting, directing, and writing.
