many reviews i've read reveals that most people tend to like part one better than part two. i feel exactly the opposite. part one played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing che guevara's personality through different types of film stock, different locations, and cutting back and forth between an interview and the cuban revolution. for the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting. in part two, che enters bolivia, and along with changing geographical location, the rules and the structure changes. gone are the spacial jumps and switching between stocks, the "documentary realism" and the treatises. instead, now we are literally trapped with che in a desaturated, depopulated landscape where the only people who exist are burdened too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option. i posit that it's the dark turn of che's life that is the real reason why most people prefer part one to part two.<br /><br />the change in geographic location also signifies, for me at least, that che: part one and che: part two are, in fact, the second two acts of a three act structure begun by motorcycle diaries. motorcycle diaries is che's coming-of-age (or more appropriately, coming-of-ideals) in argentina, che: part one is his military leadership in cuba, and che: part two is his downfall in bolivia. these movies do not completely illustrate his life (we're missing his experiences in guatamala and, more importantly in my opinion, his post-cuban revolution executions), but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol. he both symbolizes the idealism and need for armed resistance to oppression, and revolutionary failings in the post-world war ii third world countries and their hindering by such activities as, um, the cias meddling.<br /><br />but, yet again, all of that is projected on-screen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches, but through a much more intimate, suffering portrayal of che at the end of his thread and his life. again, the rules have changed, and in this case it's hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all. the number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the desaturated, shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape, an existential hell, where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second tier to the desperation of hunted people starving to death. it's just not that easy of a movie to watch, but it's very effective.<br /><br />--polarisdib
