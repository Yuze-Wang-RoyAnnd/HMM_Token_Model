on the surface, "written on the wind" is a lurid, glossy soap opera about the sexual dysfunctions of a texas oil family. but underneath it all is a deep, social commentary on 1950's life. director douglas sirk scores again with another univeral sudser. robert stack falls in love with lauren bacall. the problem is that stack's best pal, rock hudson, loves her too. when stack finds out he's sterile and bacall ends up pregnant, the fireworks fly. and, the all-too-good dorothy malone won an oscar for her portrayl of texas' biggest nympho who is shunned by hudson. good epic soap opera.
