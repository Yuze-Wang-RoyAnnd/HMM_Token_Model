i think a great many viewers missed entirely the fact that this is obviously a parody of western films.<br /><br />this is not a bad movie - it is a clever tongue in cheek take on westerns. i don't believe this film was taking itself seriously for a moment.<br /><br />what makes this film even more unique is the fact it is centered around 4 strong, beautiful women, two of which are black, one asian, and a mexican/hispanic character.<br /><br />these aren't your usual western women--they're tough--they can draw fast and shoot straight.<br /><br />they're so tough even the bartender is shaking when he pours their whiskey.<br /><br />the plot which moves this story along is typical of westerns--in the vein of "you shot my brother--so i'm gonna get you!" only in this western, a woman's sister has been shot and she's out for vengeance on the gang who did it.<br /><br />so she goes and rounds up her old cronies from her bank robbing days.<br /><br />one of them, maria, is not really all that interested in avenging rachel's sister, but she is motived by the fact there's gold and jewelry hidden in the town where they're headed.<br /><br />there are a couple of scenes that don't quite make sense, not that they interfere that much, they can be ignored, but i wondered why they were there. so the film could use a little tightening, but over all, this is a well made film that has failed to find an audience that recognized what it is.<br /><br />my only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villain--of the "heroines", one is obviously straight, the others sexual orientations are never disclosed.<br /><br />7 stars
