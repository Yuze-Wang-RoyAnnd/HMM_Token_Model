what a stunning episode for this fine series. this is television excellence at its best. the story takes place in 1968 and it's beautifully filmed in black & white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images. this is a story about two men who fall in love, but i don't want to spoil this. it is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in america. written by the superb tom pettit, and directed by the great jeannot szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. chills ran up my spine at the end when they played bob dylan's gorgeous, "ah, but i was so much older then, i'm younger than that now," as sung by the byrds. this one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars. beautiful.
