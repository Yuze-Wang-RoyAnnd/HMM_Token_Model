arthur bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multi-millionaire and is attracted to people 'below him' in social standing - he pays for a hooker in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a shoplifter.<br /><br />he drinks quite a lot too, and sometimes he is driving while drinking, too, which of course is not funny, ever. <br /><br />the movie is great but behind the comedy is some reality, too. john gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on screen and created a character for the ages. talk about deserving an oscar. moore and minnelli have their moments, but its gielgud as "hobson" you'll remember the most.
