since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my top 3 favorites. the blurb i wrote for amazon is below, and i'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on dvd on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.<br /><br />the last credit in this film explains its appeal - "thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed." a charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to new yorkers (peter bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (west 12th street, the ansonia, the old fao schwartz, the plaza, the roxy, chez brigitte, and city limits which was a country & western club). one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. i laughed, i cried, it was better than cats. not only an ode to dorothy stratten, it was also audrey hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. buy it, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you love.
