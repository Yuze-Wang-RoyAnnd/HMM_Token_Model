i think it great example of the differences between two cultures. it would be a great movie to show in a sociology class. i thought it was pretty funny and i must say that i am a sucker for that "lets band together and get the job done" plot device. it seems most people don't realize that this movie is not just a comedy. it has a few dramatic elements in it as well and i think they blend in nicely. overall, i give it a solid 8.
