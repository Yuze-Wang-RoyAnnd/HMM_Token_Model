fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. all falls apart though, when young timmy's zombie fido eats the family neighbor. from then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos) occurs. most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too). and we find the loving fido whatever he may do. this is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. it is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). i very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. i rate this 8/10. rated r for zombie related violence
