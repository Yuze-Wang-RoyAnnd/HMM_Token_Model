this is the first tom hanks movie i have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater, although he is my favorite. when i heard he was going to play a hit-man, i was a little stunned thinking "can mr. hanks pull this one off"? and he did in high fashion. this 1930's depression era film is a about loyalty, redemption, and one path that you don't want your children stumbling down. tom hanks leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan. being the family man, and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman. this movie tom hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue, which he delivers a knockout performance.<br /><br />on one night of one of his jobs, michael's son michael jr., played by newcomer tyler hoechlin, witnesses the hit. and michael sr.'s partner in crime, fellow stage actor daniel craig can't have that information out. so he wacks out the son and wife of michael sr., except michael jr. so the two head for chicago to get conner rooney(son of paul newman's mr. rooney).<br /><br />the drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right, even though son is along for the ride. while on this deadly journey, someone has hired a hit for michael sr. the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased harlen maguire, played by a stain-teethed jude law.<br /><br />the movie will have you feeling the old days. and with thomas newman's beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it, you can't help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam mendes. so sit back, and enjoy the wild ride.
