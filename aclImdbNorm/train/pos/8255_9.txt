fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days.<br /><br />as has already been pointed out, this is hardly a real zombie film, but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers. while there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented (feel-good 50s style), i can't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido & his fellow sufferers.<br /><br />while the cast is generally good, i felt that moss and nelson stood out. the humor is not in-your-face, but rather subdued; there's a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie. this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema, but it doesn't strive to be - instead, currie succeeds in delivering a heart-warming black comedy.
