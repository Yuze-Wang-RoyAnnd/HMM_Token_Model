this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history. unlike the brady's and partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt , but also get to see them back in action. filled with kapow's and catwomen and the riddler(s), batman is back ina well told , tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series , but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that haven't been heard in 35 years.<br /><br />kudos!!!
