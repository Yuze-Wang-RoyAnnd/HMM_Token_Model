this is an unusual laurel & hardy comedy with something of a split personality: at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short. happily, each portion is funny in its own right, and the boys' seemingly effortless clowning carries the day and synthesizes the film's disparate elements into an entertaining whole. while i've never heard a fan cite dirty work as his or her favorite laurel & hardy comedy, it's nonetheless one that everybody seems to like.<br /><br />our story is set in the home of professor noodle, who represents one key element of the story-line: a wildly over-the-top parody of mad scientist scenarios. this marks a rare venture into sci-fi territory for l&h; abbott & costello and the three stooges tangled with mad doctors far more often than stan & ollie. in any event, the professor is obsessed with creating a rejuvenating serum that can make people younger, while his sarcastic butler, jessup, expresses the viewer's skepticism with rolled eyes and the occasional dry quip. meanwhile, stan & ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the professor's home the very day he perfects his solution. "their" portion of the film consists of characteristic (but first-rate) slapstick involving the chimney, the roof, shovels, and a number of unfortunate mishaps. if you don't enjoy watching these guys screw up a task then you probably won't like dirty work, but for fans of the team this movie is a feast. the highlight comes when ollie plummets through the chimney, lands in the fireplace, and is then pummeled with bricks that fall onto his head with maddening rhythmic precision, one by one. i also like the shot of ollie tumbling off the roof into a greenhouse; the process work is so slapdash i suspect it was something of an inside joke, the way w.c. fields' movies would feature the world's worst rear-projection screens.<br /><br />the slapstick stuff is great fun, but it's the mad scientist motif that makes this film offbeat, and two supporting players deserve a tip of the bowler hat: prolific character actor lucien littlefield is terrific as the professor, delivering his overripe lines with relish and cackling with hammy glee, while sam adams is a stitch in the less showy role of jessup the butler. as great as stan laurel and oliver hardy were in their prime, it's always worth noting that their supporting casts at the hal roach studio gave their films an enormous boost. so too, usually, did the background music of le roy shield, but dirty work marks a rare occasion from this period that a roach comedy has no musical accompaniment at all after the opening credits. mood music might have enhanced the proceedings, but no matter; this is a highly enjoyable comedy anyhow, and a prime example of what made laurel & hardy so popular in their day.
