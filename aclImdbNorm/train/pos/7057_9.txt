as an adult i really did enjoy this one. i watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1/2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old giggled at the mice.<br /><br />the music is fun and the animation is wonderful. this sequel does what return to neverland didn't accomplish. a good follow-up to the cinderella story; but what becomes of drusilla? another sequel? i hope so!
