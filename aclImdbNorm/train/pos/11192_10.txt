i have screened this movie several times here at college, and every time i show it, the number of people watching with me grows exponentially... in addition to the virgins, anyone i've already shown it to needs to see it again! it takes a little while to get into it, but by the end the whole room is screaming, shouting, yelling, rewinding scenes repeatedly, repeating dialogue, and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is pia zadora in "the lonely lady"! scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed, poorly written, horribly acted trash is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the campiest thing i own (no small statement, friends). for me nothing compares 2 u, pia... and i don't suppose i'm the only one who's ever felt this way!
