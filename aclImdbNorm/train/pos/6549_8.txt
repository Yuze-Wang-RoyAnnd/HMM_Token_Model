taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team, how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience. in my opinion, their mission was accomplished. a must see for young children, pre-teens, teens, and their parents. ok there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order, but parents with young children should sit tight, the movie moves on to better things. i am going to go with those astute user reviewers who point out that emma roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women, not syrupy about it either. nancy balances her femininity with career minded sleuthing skills. a lot to like in here, laughs, doesn't take itself too seriously, a real mystery to solve (one you can figure out yourself as an added bonus, and likable characters. nancy drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion.
