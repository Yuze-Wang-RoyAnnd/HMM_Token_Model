got to this show late - believe it was the 3rd, and final episode, when first watched it - and was blown away by a social commentary that hasn't been seen on american tv since 'all in the family'.<br /><br />was very surprised cbs would even run this in the first place.<br /><br />which is merely to say the last time cbs 'had a set' - if you know what i mean - was back in the day of 'all in the family'. the most controversial decision they're willing to tackle today is how much eye make-up to put on katie couric.<br /><br />if you want to make a bunch of folks really, really mad - let them discover the truth about themselves. and if you want them willing to pull strings, make calls, and get a work of art removed - let them discover that truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouths.<br /><br />the aardman folks have always been way ahead of the curve. and this show is no different. somehow it snuck under the cbs 'corporate/social/political/censor radar' to get it onto the schedule (perhaps the 'big brass' never really watched it till it finally aired?), but once good 'ol middle 'merika heard and saw themselves being themselves - well, can bet the farm that message, or the messenger, won't last long.<br /><br />now, if only the 'missing episodes' can find their way onto usenet or bit-torrent ;-)<br /><br />thank you bc kelly tallahassee fla
