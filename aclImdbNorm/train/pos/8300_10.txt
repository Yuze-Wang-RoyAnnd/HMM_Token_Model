its no surprise that busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity, this film is also a poor decision, but one i enjoyed fully. the first 5 minutes is the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any film; boring, bad dialouge, and then, with a spiderman stance, busey yells the best-worst line in any film ever created..."your worst nightmare butthorn!" i coughed up some of my egg nog laughing so hard. that line resonates so well, it even tops clooney's infamous "hi freeze, i'm batman" line. other classic moments is busey constantly getting upset for people reminding him that he got his ex-cia partner killed...which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest (all made possible by a super slow-motion flashback sequence that makes watching paint dry seem exciting). there's an ashtray to the nads, punches to the face, and a "that wasn't my fault and you know it!" well, the footage shows him missing the bad guy and hitting his buddy, so... other scream out-loud moments has to be his ex girl-friend dropping a grenade to the ground to enable his escape--a plan that defies all logic, physics, and absurdity. and lastly, when mcbain jumps out of the thunderblast during intense guerrilla warfare and starts to run and hurdles a small object, i almost wet myself. some of busey's best work by far, rent or buy it today "butthorn!" my vote is a perfect 10 (on the poo meter that is).
