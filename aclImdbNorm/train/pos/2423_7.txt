once in the life means that once a hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and nobody gets in or out of `the life' for free. neighborhood hoodlums in new york sell drugs and run scams because they can't make it in the legitimate world, maybe because they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or because they're just lazy. this simple story with a couple of twists about mostly despicable characters manages to draw compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other. the film is written, produced, and directed by laurence fishburne, who also stars as 20/20 mike (all hoodlums have nicknames), and is based on his play, `riff raff.' it feels like a play from beginning to end, especially during the longest scene where the three main players square off to decide who can be trusted. often times the dialog comes very fast, much faster than it would on stage, and i think it's the film's biggest flaw. mixed in as flashbacks throughout the film are poems from the street, a sort of iambic pentameter rap, that is violent and evocative of the world this movie discloses. the poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men, these hoodlums who murder, cheat, and betray each other, as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt. the disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all. one is too stupid, another a junkie, and the last suffers from conscience while the audience wonders, or even laughs, at the irony of executioners demanding from him hanging in the gallows to tell jokes in the midst of his demise.
