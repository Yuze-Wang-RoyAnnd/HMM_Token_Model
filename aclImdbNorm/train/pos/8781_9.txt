i consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "gentleman jim" the best boxing movie ever made. that is the robert wise/paul newman flick "somebody up there likes me." that movie might be number 1, but "gentleman jim" is a close number 2.<br /><br />the movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of james j. corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. in the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more "gentlemanly" days of the gloved, marquis of queensbury rules. and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.<br /><br />"gentleman jim" is not a realistic look at those days. it is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. but always delightfully so. errol flynn is perfect as the "gentleman" jim who really isn't a "gentleman" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).<br /><br />at the end of "gentleman jim" the great john l sullivan (whose famous line was not "i can lick any man in the world" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to corbett. this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. realistic? no. but wonderful. hey, if you want realism watch "raging bull" instead. that is a much more realistic boxing movie. but "gentleman jim" is a lot more fun.
