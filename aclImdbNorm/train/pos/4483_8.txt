everything a musical comedy should be. gene kelly (as joe brady) doesn't miss a step, and frank sinatra (as clarence doolittle) doesn't miss a note. scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot. sinatra's "i fall in love too easily" is an indication of his then and future best. kelly's "mexican hat dance" with a young mexican girl is delightful. kelly certainly earned his nomination as best actor. and there is a bushel of truly funny lines, like: "you think the navy takes dopes?"; "you think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?"; and, "we got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid." a thoroughly enjoyable movie, just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded world war ii.
