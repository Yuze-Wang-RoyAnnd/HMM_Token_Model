i gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable. well, i paid to see it in a theatre, and i'm glad i did because visually it was a striking film. most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s (except for the shrink's office, which was dated in a different way), and if you leave the neve campbell sequences out, the whole film has a washed- out early 60s ambience. and the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating. for a first-time director whose background, i believe, is in writing, he has a great eye. within the first ten minutes i felt the plot lacked plausibility, so i just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride. in terms of acting and the depiction of father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child relationships, the film was spot-on. william h. macy, a pleasure to watch, seems to be filling the void left by the late tony perkins, if this and magnolia are any indication. tracey ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving, to me. it was a three-dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two-dimensional. of course, donald sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals. the depiction of the parents (bain/sutherland) reminded me, in an indirect way, of vincent gallo's buffalo '66, although toned-down quite a bit! i would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director. he has the self-discipline of a 50s b-crimefilm director (something p.t.anderson will never have!), yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention.
