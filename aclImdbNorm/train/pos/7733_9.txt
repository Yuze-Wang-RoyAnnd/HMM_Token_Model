foley's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is seemingly "perfectly" fit together. shot by shot, edit by edit, the film unfolds itself around a disturbed boxer discovering his own purpose (or lack thereof). the other comments around perhaps indicate a lack of pulp interest, but i personally think this is a superbly put together cinematic piece!
