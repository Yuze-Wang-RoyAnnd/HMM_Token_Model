to "bend it like beckham" may not mean much to us americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to english sports fans, it is equivalent to "hit it like bonds" or "dunk it like jordan." any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal, much like star player david beckham does, much like the young indian girl, jess (parminder nagra), does in the film bend it like beckham. jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. however, while playing one day, a passing friend named jules (keira knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team. after satisfying the coach joe (jonathan rhys-meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. the movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents. there is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian. the movie does resort to a bit of a clich'e moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as jess' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light. the soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience. bend it like beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.
