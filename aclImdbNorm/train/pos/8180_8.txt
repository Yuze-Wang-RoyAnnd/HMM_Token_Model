this is an entertaining movie. actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn't some undead psychopath or sociopath, its your everyday doctor. how scary is that. got some good actors and actresses in this movie, though some where unappreciated like virginya keehne as sarah. ken foree who you might recognize from rob zombie's devils rejects and halloween(2007) co-stars as our detective on schizoid dr. alan feinstone's(corbin benson)trail. short little summary is this: dr. alan feinstone, a guy who has a sexy wife, nice house, and is a great dentist everyone loves. until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner. then he starts having hallucinations that his patients' teeth are all rotted and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller. but before that, nice guy.
