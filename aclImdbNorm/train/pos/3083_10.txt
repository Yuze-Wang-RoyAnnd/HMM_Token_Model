this deserves a 12 out of 10. an absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. this show needs to come back, i've seen every episode and this is real quality.<br /><br />the show centers around a couple of new yorkers, plays around with the concept of the six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwines their lives. bridget moynahan and jay hernandez are stunning and so is the adorable caseman. the scenery is amazing and wardrobes are exquisite.<br /><br />we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones.<br /><br />if it never comes back, six degrees will be sorely missed.
