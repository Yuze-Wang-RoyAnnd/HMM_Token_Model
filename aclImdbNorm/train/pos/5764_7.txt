i originally reviewed this film on amazon about 6 or 7 years ago, and blasted it. i believe i called it "wretched" and a "turkey." okay, well, by most standards, it's still a turkey. it's got almost no production values, what little plot there is makes almost no sense, and the acting is on the level of a third-grade play. that said, this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic. in fact, all of director todd sheets' films have had this effect. they're almost like ed wood in that regard: watch them over and over and pick out the flubbed lines, continuity errors (same zombie, two different locations!), and other flaws.<br /><br />i'll say this: sheets is a very nice guy, and while this, one of his first productions, isn't that great, he has gotten better. and i must add that the only really decent actor/actress in the film is kasey rousch, though i may be biased, as i attended school with her.
