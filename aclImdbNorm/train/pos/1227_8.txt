i caught this movie on my local movie channel, and i rather enjoyed watching the film. it has all the elements of a good teen film, and more - this film, aside from dealing with boys-girls relationships and sex and the like, also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people.<br /><br />the film has that real-life feel to it - no loud music, no special effects and no outrageous scenes - which, for this movie, was right. that feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film - some of which we probably know from where we live.<br /><br />overall, a good movie, fun to watch.<br /><br />8/10
