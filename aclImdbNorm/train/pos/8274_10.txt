this movie is excellent. i found it very interesting. i thought the wendigo legend was pretty cool. the acting was also great, as well as the costumes, production, photography, directing and script. <br /><br />a very happy family, on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer. a huntsman then appears and is very angry and outraged over the fact that one of the deer's antler's is broken. he then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them. <br /><br />see this movie. it's worth it. kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. two thumbs way up!
