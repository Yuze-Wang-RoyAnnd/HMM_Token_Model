there has never been anything like it, that's for sure. this episodic, seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole, and as such it is not a movie about groovin' gary, utah cross-dressing sensation. it is very self-consciously a film about how the filmmaker reacts to groovin' gary. for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance. he's trying to atone for his sins - yes, gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired - through correction, commentary, and convention, reclaiming such hollywood-narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending (two different ones, with a telling adjustment in the glover version) and turning them to his own very personal uses. so while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference, the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies - but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity. there is just so much going on; in telling and re-telling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row, and he doesn't miss the opportunity to make something of it. immensely moving, and as profound as camp ever gets.
