paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film made up of 18 segments. you can do the math--18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story. the movie is based on the premise that you can, indeed, tell a story in that short amount of time. the premise works. almost all of the segments are powerful, complete, and satisfying. each presents a different aspect of the parisian experience, and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near-great actors.<br /><br />there were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it's hard to pick one or two favorites. probably the most memorable to me were juliette binoche as a grieving mother in the segment "place des victoires," gena rowlands as an aging beauty in "quartier latin," catalina sandino moreno as a maid in the segment "loin du 16`eme" and margo martindale as a colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak french so she can visit paris ("14`eme arrondissement" segment). <br /><br />special mention must be given to gulliver hecq, probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an american tourist in a parisian metro station (segment "tuileries").<br /><br />this is an outstanding movie. my wife and i decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed. however, paris is photographed so beautifully that i would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen. in any case, don't miss it!
