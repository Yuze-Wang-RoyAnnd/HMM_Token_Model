ok...this one's a weirdy....honestly, i can't tell you all the inner plot-points of the beast, cuz i started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes - but just wait, it definitely does "pick up"...<br /><br />the plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some french aristocrat chick screwed back in the day. eventually you see "the beast", which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat-bear costume with a horse cock attached to it. the scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep. the sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared. the beast pops up, rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her. eventually the chick starts to enjoy the beast's "attention" which results in some pretty novel simulated sex scenes, including an unnervingly erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman jerks the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere (yeah, i've got a twisted foot-fetish - so sue me....)...the whole film is told in flashbacks and long-winded dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious. a "shocking" but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange film...<br /><br />the beast is a film that i find kind of hard to rate. the cinematography itself is quite eye-catching and the sets, costumes and locations are elaborate. the plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat-bear. a good bit of tits, ass, and hairy 70's french bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film. i have to honestly say, that if it weren't for the graphic scenes of the beast spackling all over the willing maiden, this film would have been a real bore - that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex (the beginning has a very up-close and personal scene of two horses boning, including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vagina...yum!!!). but the beast sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film, that i have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer. i have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks they've seen it all - the beast rape really is out-there and something to be witnessed. also recommended to any fans of 70's/80's sleaze films - this one ranks pretty high with them. worth a look for you sick rat-bear beastiality lovers out there (like me)...8/10
