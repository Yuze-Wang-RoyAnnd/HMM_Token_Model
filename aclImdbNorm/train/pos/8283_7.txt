a solid b movie.<br /><br />i like jake weber. his understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances. i liked the relationship between the father and son. i liked the family dynamics. the wendigo looks silly, but it is a representation of the kid's toy and the dead deer. it's an amalgamation like, see? this is a psychological story, not a freddy slash em up instant gratification flick. watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you'll be fine.<br /><br />nice work.
