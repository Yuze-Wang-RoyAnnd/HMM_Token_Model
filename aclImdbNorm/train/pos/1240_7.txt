eddie murphy plays chandler jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. when the beautiful kee nang {charlotte lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child. sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon sardo numspa.<br /><br />is the golden child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was eddie murphy and the golden child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. for i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, it's box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny eddie murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. the golden child is not up with the more accepted 80s murphy pictures like trading places and beverly hills cop, but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains murphy at his wisecracking, quipping and charming best!, seriously!.<br /><br />cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by raiders of the lost ark in 1981, the golden child hits all the required genre buttons. pretty girl, daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain {charles dance so english i could kiss him myself}, wonderful colour, and a cute kid with mystical powers, the film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. yes the cgi demon looks creaky now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious, seriously. 7/10
