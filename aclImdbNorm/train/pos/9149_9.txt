i had never seen richard thomas play a bad guy. i wasn't sure i would like him this way. and i wasn't sure he could pull it off. but this astounded me. he sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people. the movie is engrossing and fast paced. bruce davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy. the real talent here is thomas. the ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that's the way real people would fight... if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad!
