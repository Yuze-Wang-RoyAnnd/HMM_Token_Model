grey gardens is shocking, amusing, sad and mesmerizing. i watched in amazement as ediths jr. and sr. bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past. their existence in a dilapidated mansion, (which they had not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. this is a film you will not soon forget.
