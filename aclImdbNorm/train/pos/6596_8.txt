brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve. rather incredibly, contra todos (against everybody) (original title, which the producers discarded: god against everybody) got very low gpa (grade point average) in this website. it seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectators at large. actually, it is not so brutal. i mean as far as graphical violence is concerned. its brutality is intrinsic as it portrays would-be lumpens, i mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment, who coldly perform murder orders in exchange of "grana gra'uda". is this post-modern man? is his/her only worry a quick, almost impersonal, ultra permissive lay, amidst over satiating meals ? the picture is probably the best brazilian film of 2004, so far. its shining editing style, `a la godard, its curious soundtrack counterpoints, its more than efficient overall cast and, above all, its original narration, with subtle non-chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue, deserve at least an 8 mark.
