i know that you've already entered this in film festivals (or at least i think you have, i may just be making that up) but i think this should get "best animated short film" in every one. bravo. i can't wait for the full film. i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but hear it now and accept it as the truth. kudos, my friend. okay, now i'm just trying to get ten lines of text... though i still mean it. and here comes yet another -shoe!- and i cannot stop here yet. this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do. in fact, i'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic "jason steele marathon." i do have a lot of those.<br /><br />-r
