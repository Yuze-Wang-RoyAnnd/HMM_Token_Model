sogo ishii has taken the old myth of musashibo benkei and stood it on its head to produce a dark, gory, spellbinding and terrific-looking movie. those unfamiliar with the legend won't need to be; the story explains itself nicely as it goes along. well worth seeking out even though there are no english-language home video versions.
