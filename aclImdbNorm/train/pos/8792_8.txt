an entertaining kung fu film, with acting, plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky. all of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists. alexander fu-sheng's proto-jackie chan comedy antics are fun to watch, and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills. for me, the film's only glaring flaw is the size of the cast -- at times, things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots, and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed-out as one might wish.<br /><br />but a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action, and shaolin temple definitely delivers on that count. the film climaxes with a high-bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent.<br /><br />overall, shaolin temple is an enjoyable low-budget kung fu movie. not up to the quality of a good jet li film, but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre. my rating: 8/10.<br /><br />misc notes: the 1987 warner home video release i saw was (predictably) poorly dubbed, and lacked full cast & crew credits.
