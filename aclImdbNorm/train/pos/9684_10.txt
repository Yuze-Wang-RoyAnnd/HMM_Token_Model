this movie brought tears to my eyes; john roberts really knew how to get to viewers' hearts, directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through the mind and heart of paulie. we discover from time to time, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like john, that even small creatures like paulie have a heart. i just couldn't stop my tears, even though the film has a happy end. this is great, after thousands of films i saw through my life, "paulie" really touched me deeply. this is, after the "ugly duckling", the second picture that really turned me upside down.
