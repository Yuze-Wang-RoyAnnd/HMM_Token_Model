this is one of the few movies i watched twice in the theatre. i really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero esteban trueba. he makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption. isn't this a rather consoling thought?<br /><br />when i watched it for the first time, i thought that after the won election, the movie would be over - i didn't know the book. so boy was i wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come! i was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film.<br /><br />many people here utterly dislike this movie. i cannot understand that one single bit. maybe those who read the book first are - as often with screen adaptations of novels - simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold, unseen, unexplained. but as a movie telling a touching story - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the strength of love and the insanity of hate (and conservatism) - this movie is simply splendid! furthermore, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well - especially winona ryder and jeremy irons.<br /><br />so definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for!
