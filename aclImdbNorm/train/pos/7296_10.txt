there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. profiler looks crispy, fortier looks classic. profiler plots are quite simple. fortier's plot are far more complicated... fortier looks more like prime suspect, if we have to spot similarities... the main character is weak and weirdo, but have "clairvoyance". people like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. how about just enjoying? funny thing too, people writing fortier looks american but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer american series (!!!). maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but i think this series is more english than american. by the way, the actors are really good and funny. the acting is not superficial at all...
