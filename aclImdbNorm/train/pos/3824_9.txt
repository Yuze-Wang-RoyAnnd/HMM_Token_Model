i did not intend to write this review, but having read the default review that shows up on this movie's url, i felt compelled to write a rebuttal. the movie in a word is superlative. it does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written. i think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent. in fact, i too was turned off by the excessive show of evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent. however, i must beg to differ with the reviewer in that, this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action. i think, what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers, how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic, simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another. this does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary, mostly well meaning, basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life. ultimately, it is a matter of faith. you have to take it on faith and that's all. and if you are given to faith, then you can appreciate any show of faith. and if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome. it is thus at the same time, instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie. in any case, the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are 'secret sunshine' in this world that awaits all wounded souls, regardless of their religious orientation. and that's just the core message of the film! please note the last scene of the movie, if you don't get this! in the end, the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you - the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself. thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally. i do agree with the reviewer in that, the evangelical stuff was a bit too much. however, given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie, i think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an evangelist
