coming of age movies are quite usual these days. for 1980, "foxes" really gives its meaning. jodie foster plays her character straight out. ever since she did "taxi driver" four years earlier, she has a stronger character in this movie. she's jeanie, a high schooler who has plenty of guts, and seems to get out of any situation she's in. scott baio plays brad way before chachi on "happy days". he's deemed immature by the other girls. cherie currie is annie, hangs with the wrong crowd, chased by her policeman father. jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand. exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous. annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted. reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident. and one gets married to a much older man. growing up isn't easy, sometimes we got to explore life how it is. in reality, you got to be careful about the people surrounding you. for me, i was my own person, and i tend to stay that way! great music, great plot, this movie's a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
