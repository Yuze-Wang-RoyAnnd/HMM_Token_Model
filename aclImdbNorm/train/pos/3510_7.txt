true fans of film will love this authentic movie.<br /><br />i disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one-star and calling it unrealistic. while i don't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists, i've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave. i don't know what the basis is for others' comments that the film is "unrealistic". the dialog is great.<br /><br />the low budget production value didn't bother me a bit. i felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film. the focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy hollywood propping or melodrama.<br /><br />i completely bought into the character's motivations and reactions. the acting was believable and impressive for new and non-actors.<br /><br />if your idea of good film is transformers or fast & furious, then skip it. if you enjoy good character driven dramas, then see it.<br /><br />(regarding the negative commenters being "trolls": click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews.)
