a sentimental story with a sentimental sound track. it's about a little girl ( with a voice impediment ) who treasures her green parrot paulie. the parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion.<br /><br />the parrot is definitely the star of the film. at times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way. the synchronised voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists.<br /><br />early in the film her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of paulie's constant struggle over many years to be re-united with his mistress. one of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic teller machines. paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory.<br /><br />the ending is predictable, but who would want it otherwise. children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in paulie's antics.
