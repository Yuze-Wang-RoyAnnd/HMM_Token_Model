the story: on the island texel, photographer bob, who makes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious kathleen. her free spirit and lust for life intrigues bob, who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. her life is not so simple as it seems, however. through kathleen, bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. will kathleen be able to win his trust?<br /><br />review: the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character's 'psychology' would have been worked out a little more. why do these people do the things they do? what motivates their choices? this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view. the story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters go through enough to justify that. so you don't get to know the characters on that deeper level. the actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and 'believable' way, but i think it would have suited the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this character's naiveness doesn't quite work for a grown-up woman. camera-work is nice, and there are some great shots of the nature on the island. i give the movie a 7/10.
