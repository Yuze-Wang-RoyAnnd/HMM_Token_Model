this film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks. then meena kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in. songs on all india radio, especially inhi logon ne were played so often that i was sick of them at the time, despite recognising their beauty! <br /><br />yes, it did take all those years to make. this was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and kamal amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film; looking at the sumptous sets and costumes, not surprising!! not only does meena kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to lata's voice. inhi logon ne has her 50's younger voice while songs that were re-recorded like chalo dildar chalo show clear development. i only wish someone would find the ghulam mohammad songs that weren't included in the film, because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them. lata in a recent interview (2007) rated ghulam mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with, apart from madan mohan (a great personal friend). notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the chalo dildar songs, very unusual. there is only a brief shot of raj kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed meena kumari. kamal amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon. any other film, this song would have had close-ups of both of them.<br /><br />as for this being the finest film ever, i would beg to differ. it means you have missed a lot of indian cinema, in no particular order, films like barsaat (old), devdas (older versions), bandini, do bigha zameen, garam hava, dastak, guddi, aan, pyasa, kagaz ke phool, sahib bibi aur ghulam, kabuliwallah, abhimaan, guide, sujatha, bombay ka babu, daag, parineeta (old), umrao jaan, etc. etc. and if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from barsat ki raat to naya daur, teesri manzil, mahal, aag, jugnu, anand, mera naam joker: the list is really endless!<br /><br />so enjoy pakeezah but don't miss out on any of the above...
