"erendira" is a film from mexico that is rarely talked about. the film only exists in a low quality vhs format. it's a shame this film hasn't been given a dvd release. "erendira" is stunning and gorgeous with its magic-realist images. "erendira" is based on a short story from the novel "100 years of solitude". erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma's house. her evil grandma, played by irene papas, forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages. the whole town gets a piece of erendira, so to speak. although the subject matter sounds harsh, the film doesn't exploit sexuality. it's done in a mature artistic manner. the film also has some amazing costumes. some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most, are the origami birds that morph into real birds, and a golden orange with a diamond in the center. erendira is an amazing film, that even manages to throw in humor. this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release. as they'd say in espanol, "es muy muy bien !!! excellente!
