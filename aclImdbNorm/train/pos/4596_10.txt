this is jackie chan's best film, and my personal favourite. after the disappointing u.s made 'the protector' directed by james glickenhaus, jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into hong kong. this is also probably jackies most violent movie, with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stunts.<br /><br />the action is fast and furious, jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design. bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as you'll see in the credits.<br /><br />the script is a simple cops and robbers affair, nothing special, after all it was written around the action. i must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing, but it shouldn't put you off too much.<br /><br />so, get the lads round, crack open the beers and enjoy. by the way, the film was nicknamed 'glass story' by the stunt crew. why? i'll let you find out for yourself!!
