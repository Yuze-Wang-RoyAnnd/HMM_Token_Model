i really enjoyed this movie. the acting by the adult actors was great, although i did find the main kid a little stiff. but he carried himself very well for being a new talent. the humor is very sublime and not in your face like most hollywood comedy junk. i.e. the nutty professor. if you have a short attention span and are used to the typical hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced. i picked it up on blu-ray and i have to say the image quality is top notch. probably one of the better looking blu-rays i've seen so far. the extras were cool too. they deleted quite a bit, but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything.
