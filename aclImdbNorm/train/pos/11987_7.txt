since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept, but first some insider notes from a movie critic.<br /><br />this animated series is one of those that i grew up with, it made my childhood joyful, it made it awesome, miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don't see as much as we did back in the days, well on to the review...<br /><br />talespin, or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series, it is much like chip and dale, ducktales and a lot of those old ones, so it has that weird feeling surrounding it, i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it.<br /><br />but in my opinion it was very great, it came with some kind of message, not that wild of a message, however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven.<br /><br />now i don't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that, we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that, yet i feel like that we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days.<br /><br />now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much, to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones, give me back my childhood cartoons, give them to the kids i have some day, give them again...
