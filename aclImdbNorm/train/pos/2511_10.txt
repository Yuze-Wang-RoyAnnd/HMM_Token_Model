i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession. i just wanted to check it out. i was not expecting much of anything. after all, a musician, an actor and a screenplay writer? not possible for so much talent to reside in one person. right?? <br /><br />wrong!! obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects. the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along. as the credits roll by, you suddenly realize you were glued until the end.<br /><br />at times, the acting seems a little over the top. i do, however, believe it's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character. otherwise, i wouldn't have expected the level of acting witnessed.<br /><br />it's worth seeing more than once. i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two around.<br /><br />i completely recommend this movie. feel free to go in with your doubts, but i'm sure it will find a place on your shelf.
