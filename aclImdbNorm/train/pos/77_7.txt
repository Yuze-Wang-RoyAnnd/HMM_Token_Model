the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician. however, mid-way through the very successful show, the police come and shut him down. it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had created--even those he made on his own time at home. as a result, price justifiably kills the evil man. the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing, because price was a bit mad, he just couldn't stop at one (sort of like eating lay's potato chips).<br /><br />the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows), great plot twists as well as exciting action. one thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull. while it's also far from subtle, it is fun throughout, though and well worth a look.<br /><br />had i never seen vincent price's version of house of wax, i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9. that's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film, it's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it (house of wax). the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful, the formula was re-hashed in the follow-up film. both were made in 3-d, both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he can't stop once he's committed the first and both are great fun to watch. the biggest differences, and there are few, are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mystery.<br /><br />my advice is to see this film and house of wax (the price version only). they are both terrific 1950s horror films.
