felt it was very balanced in showing what jehovahs witnesses have done in protecting american freedoms. it also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses. i also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a jehovahs witness affects non-witness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they don't celebrate holidays, the sad part is that non-witness families do not think of having their witness family over for family dinners/visits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or birthdays. when it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatments causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained, which would you prefer to treat your loved ones? i highly recommend this video!
