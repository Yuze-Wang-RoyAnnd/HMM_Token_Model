eytan fox did it again : move the viewer's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess. the movie also succeeds in describing so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is tel aviv.<br /><br />i was there a month ago and it is all there : the lifestyle, the relationships, the heart-beating city, the mess, the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light-hearted, blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever.<br /><br />strongly recommend: it is a voyage for the heart and the mind, with an interesting perspective to the israelo-palestinian conflict.<br /><br />nota bene: there is central gay plot in the movie. if you do not think you are too gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as "just love". (and don't worry: the chick is hot too!)
