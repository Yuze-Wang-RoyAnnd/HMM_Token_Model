this film is an interesting take on the killer scarecrow genre - amazingly it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts. average montage scenes, 30-somethings playing teenagers, and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the "new-wave" of modern classics. as a viewer, i came away from the film with the same sense of "shock and awe" as when i first saw the godfather in 1969. tiffany gardner's startling portrayal of the morally bankrupt judy was deserving of her grammy nomination, which was well documentedly stolen by ricky martin and restless hips. unfortunately, the none of the sequels could live up to the expectation of the original (unlike the godfather series which got better with each installment, and should culminate in 2012 with godfather 4: eat my rage.
