this work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs. this film never tries to tone it down, cotton candy-ize, or soft soap the angst, confusion, and pain of what these guys live with. that is its strength, i think.<br /><br />but more so, the performances are fantastic, with well conceived and delivered dialog, which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience. the characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what's on their mind-what's in their hearts.<br /><br />i found it plodding, but enjoyable.<br /><br />it rates a 6.6/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
