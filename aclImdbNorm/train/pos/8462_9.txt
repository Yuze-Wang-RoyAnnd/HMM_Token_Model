i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes, i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow, yet thoughtful actions of the story-telling. i am still a fan.....with some minor pains.<br /><br />though this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had-a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything(sound familiar?), i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow-dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly-ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plans(especially the character called wufei...i mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera. get a counselor,will ya?)<br /><br />besides for the over-exaggerated drama(i think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again. i mean it can always be worse. it could be like the recent installment, seed......eeeewwww, talk about mellow-dramatic....i'll chat about that one later.
