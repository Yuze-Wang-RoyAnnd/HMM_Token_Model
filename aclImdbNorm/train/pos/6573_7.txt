the movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start - i think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and dramatization make a movie version seem a bit too artificial. but, still, it's carried out fairly well, and the story & especially the dialogue are interesting. they've taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as is from the actual play. perhaps it's a good introduction to shaw's plays.<br /><br />the main character raina has her head in the clouds & and a flair for the dramatic, and helena bonham carter's acting does a good job here. her fianc'e, serges, is a bit too cartoonish when he is really supposed to be an extremely handsome dashing figure. her parents are entertaining enough.
