when i was a kid of 8, i always watched movies and television that i wasn't supposed to, and this was one of them. <br /><br />it's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life, the acting is excellent, they don't make comedies like this anymore these days (movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomit-inducing body fluid as in those retarded judd apatow movies starring unfunny non-actors like seth rogen, barf).<br /><br />this movie is a classic with actors who can actually act, and deserve all the accolades.
