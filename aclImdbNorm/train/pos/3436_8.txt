letters with no destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office. here, alice manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father. what she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss, frank. a quiet little aussie flic that came and went at the cinema. now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop, overshadowed by fifty copies of that dreaded godzilla film. it's a shame because this turned out to be a satisfying film telling a brave tale with strong simple images and effective performances from the two leads. this film succeeds where garry marshall's other dead letter office flic dear god (1996 - usa) failed, and comes close to the brilliance of, not the kevin costner turkey, but he jianjun's postman (1995 - china).
