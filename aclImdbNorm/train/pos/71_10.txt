i couldn't believe the comments made about the movie.<br /><br />as i read the awful opinions about the movie i actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that i did.<br /><br />what i viewed was incredible! i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the movie.<br /><br />i hadn't had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i couldn't have been more set back by the incredible job that they did i'd have to say its the most believable movie that i've seen in a long time. <br /><br />what i don't see is why everyone has such a problem with deanna's choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene, from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice. that i don't understand, its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see. i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend. opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded. i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great roles.<br /><br />busy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her! you go girl!
