i saw this movie when it first came out. it was an official selection for the temecula valley international film festival and i voted for it for best picture.<br /><br />justine priestley is hot as the psychotic, but complex amanda. this is not your ordinary psycho movie. lots of interesting and original slants on the genre. sort of a "fatal attraction" for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of amanda's affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off.<br /><br />
