i haven't watched the movie yet, but can't wait to see it! it seems very interesting and inspirational. it was one of the most interesting trailers i've ever seen: the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the "battle within"... thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing. this film looks so fresh and smart. and the actor is really hot. i especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the rocky movies, really clever. i thought that the topic selected-overcoming adversities and childhood traumas-is timeless, and god knows a lot of people need it. bring it on.
