i am obsessed! the story is amazing and the show is highly addictive, but i love it. i am on season 2, disc 5, and i tell you that i am too attached to the characters now. for anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show. and, michael is on my list now. kidding... i am so happy to see there is a season 3, because i was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending. i can't wait to see the rest now. thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of lost...i enjoy watching tv again. before lost i surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television, but i have to say that lost is my kind of entertainment!
