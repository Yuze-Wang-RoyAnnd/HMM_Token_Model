these two stars are the only iconic heroes/villains i know that got a good tv series, so let's compare.<br /><br />freddy - 7 movies robocop - 3 movies<br /><br />freddy - 1 tv series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes robocop - 1 tv series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes<br /><br />freddy - 2 extra films (freddy vs jason, freddy vs ghostbusters) robocop - 4 extra films (robocop: prime directives: dark justice, meltdown, crach & burn, resurrection)<br /><br />freddy - 1 upcoming film robocop - 1 upcoming film<br /><br />who's had more screen time? well they've both had 7 movies, 1 tv series, and 1 upcoming film. but freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one being a fan film) & 17-18 tv episodes.<br /><br />since this is a comment for the series, between freddy's nightmares - anoes: the series & robocop: the series i would personally choose robocop...
