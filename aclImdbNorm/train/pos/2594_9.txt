this movie took the jerry springer approach to super-human power. "wilder napalm" is the kind of theme-based movie that i love, addressing the idea that prodigies in america are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them. at the same time, the movie points out that every prodigy is only human, and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being. this was a great comedy, fun and human with that slight satiric edge.
