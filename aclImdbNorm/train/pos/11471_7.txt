i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was. i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed. the two lead actors are awesome, the film isn't ever boring, and the concept behind it (though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers) is really interesting. there are some weaknesses, such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn't make any sense at all. the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction, but in cinema verite that is a given. but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit.
