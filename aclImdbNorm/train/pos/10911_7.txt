enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially, william powell, (dr. lawrence bradford), "mister roberts", who played the role as a doctor and detective. dr. bradford was once married to jean arthur, (paula bradford), "shane", and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time. paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important. jean arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey on a california race track. robert armstrong, (nick martel) "king kong" gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with james gleason, a detective who need the help of dr. bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery. if you see this film, just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in those days!
