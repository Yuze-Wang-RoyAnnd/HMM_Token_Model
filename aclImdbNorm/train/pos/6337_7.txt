i've had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for more than 40 years, since my 5th grade teacher, a native texan, told stories of ones he saw in his youth. fortunately, i've lived my whole life in the middle atlantic states, where tornadoes are rare and usually not as violent as the ones in the midwest, but i have had two close encounters, one in pa and the other in nj, in the past decade.<br /><br />i enjoyed the family scenes, particularly the conflicts between jack and dan hatch. when the tornado was close, dan knew most of what he had to do, and he probably learned this in school, since i know that tornado safety is an important subject in parts of the u.s. where these storms are more frequent. however, characters in the movie did two things that some people think are supposed to be done or are safe to do in tornadoes but are actually not supposed to be done or are unsafe.<br /><br />when the siren first sounded, dan and arthur went through the house and opened the windows. for years, this is what people were told to do, but tornado safety web sites now advise against doing this. also, people were shown hiding in a highway underpass. this method was made popular by an early 1990s video made by a t.v. crew during a relatively weak twister in kansas. however, in the most serious tornadoes, people can be sucked out from these underpasses. this happened during a may 1999 outbreak in oklahoma.<br /><br />the tornadoes in this movie hit in the fall, which is not a common time for them to happen. (then again, one of my close encounters took place in late september.) also, they traveled from northwest to southeast, while most such storms in the northern hemisphere go from southwest to northeast. however, this is not all that unusual. a famous tornado that struck joliet, il, in the early 1990s traveled in that direction (as did the one involved in my other close encounter).<br /><br />i think that the movie should have been set in the spring. this movie was based on a book that in turn was based on an actual event that happened on june 3, 1980. but it was still a compelling story.
