our song is a marvelous example of passionate, movie making at its aesthetic best. it is, in fact, a genuine wonder of a movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city (crown heights, brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their approaching adulthood will compel each of them to make a number of difficult, life altering choices that will likely re-define who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come.<br /><br />jim mckay's writing/direction is graceful and uncluttered. there is no sappy, gratuitous sentimentality nor are there clich'e ridden solutions in this film. what we see here seems, at times, to be heart breakingly real. there is a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in our song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including american graffiti and cooley high.<br /><br />much of the credit for the film's spirit goes to its principle actors. the combined presence of melisa martinez (maria), kerry washington (lanisha), and anna simpson (joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful. it would be easy - and, of course, blatantly obtuse - to dismiss, as some apparently have, the performances of these three as apathetic or unemotional. in fact, their quiet charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely riveting. one would have to be completely "out of touch" with, or completely indifferent to, the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen. likewise, the supporting cast, particularly marlene forte as lanisha's mother, compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />our song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age.
