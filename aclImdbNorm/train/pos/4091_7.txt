i saw this film in a london cinema in 1975 and have not seen it since. i found it hilarious. i loved it's originality. it's rare that someone makes a movie like this - and it's sad too.<br /><br />what i mean is, i once read a book called "the black hotel" - and as a film-fan, i always "picture" books as films. kinda "adapt" them, you know? but as i read it, i thought, well, this would make a great movie - but of course it would have to be "adapted" - to the point where it would bear little relationship to the book.<br /><br />but then i thought, well why? sure, it could never be shown on sunday afternoon tv, but provided it were shown in cinemas to adults, who knew what it contained, where's the harm? dammit, my civil liberties were being crushed here. a director should be able to make a literal film adaptation of "the black hotel".<br /><br />in an ideal world, censorship of films for adults should not exist. but sadly, whilst i accept that with intelligent adults, such freedom might be harmless, there would always be those who would lack the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality, and who might be spurred on to commit foul deeds.<br /><br />however, it's hard to see how "la bete" falls into that category.<br /><br />on it's appearance in england, the british censor dismissed it out of hand. despite the '69 relaxation on nudity, given the film's theoretical theme of bestiality, had the censor passed any of it, he'd have been looking for a new job on monday.<br /><br />but... in those days, there was an alternative. the g.l.c. this was a local town council with a department who had the power to pass a film just for london, where it was deemed audiences were more "sopisticated" than those who lived out in the sticks.<br /><br />the film was duly submitted and passed. however, it later emerged that the "board" consisted of just four people - three who voted, plus a "chairman". and on the day, one of the voters was off sick. thus the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down to view "la bete".<br /><br />one of said voters thought, like me, that the film was hilarious and hardly likely to encourage foul deeds by anyone. the other lacked imagination and simply thought the piece disgusting. and the chairman didn't understand it, so decided to err on the side of freedom.<br /><br />when the missing voter finally saw the film, they too thought it disgusting, but it was too late! the film had received its "x-london" certificate and opened to mixed reaction. the g.l.c. film censorship board was disbanded soon after! thus "la bete" only opened in london by what could best be termed a fluke! but i'm glad it was. it's great! if you haven't seen it, do so. it's a fantasy, and as such, it's far less disturbing than most things you see on the news these days...
