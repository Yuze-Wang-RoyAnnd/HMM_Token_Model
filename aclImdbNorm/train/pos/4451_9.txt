the premise of the story is simple: an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child, and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred. though very little dialog is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative told by the camera's eye alone made the film quite engaging. the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness, which complements the quietness of the characters themselves. we can also sense helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder, which parallels the silenced child's inability to tell her own story.<br /><br />true horror lies in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and irrationality. this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak.<br /><br />cleverly, the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments. the ending is also unexpected and believable. reminiscent of japanese horror films, such as "the ring," and "dark water," or english horror films, such as "lady in black," and "the innocents," this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror. i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try.<br /><br />by the way, if you haven't seen the films i just mentioned above, you might want to give them a try as well.
