i've been looking for the name of this film for years. i was 14 when i believe it was aired on tv in 1983. all i can remember was it was about a teenaged girl, alone, having survived a plane crash and surviving the amazon. i remember people were looking for her(family) and that she knew how to take care of herself---she narrates the story and i vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin. i don't remember much else about this movie, and want to see it again--if this is the same one--and if any of you have a copy, could you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? i'd be curious to attain a copy to see if it is in fact the same film i remember. it was aired on thanksgiving(us) in 1983, and i was going through problems of my own and this film really impacted heavily on me. thanks in advance!
