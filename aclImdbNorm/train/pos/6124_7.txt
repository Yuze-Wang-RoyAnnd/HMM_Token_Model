this movie is goofy as hell! i think it was written as a serious film, but then when it came time to film, michael cooney said "hey, let's throw in some humor and spice it up!" the characters are actually slightly developed, too. oh, and the death sequences are the best. one thing i hate, though, was the hairdryer-weapons. what was that all about?
