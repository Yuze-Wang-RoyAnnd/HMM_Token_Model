i loved this show from it's first airing, and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week. the plot, characters, writing, special affects were outstanding! then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining, well written show. i say bring it back, i know all of the actors would come back. i would suggest buying the dvd's, i am. i hope the sci-fi channels executives get word of these comments, and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. i only watch one show on that channel now, (ghost hunters), but i am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too.
