this is the first movie i've seen of john singleton and he is a pretty good director. the movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them. omar epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and having a hard time keeping up with his work. he is friends with ice cube and beings dating tyra banks. kristy swanson is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with jennifer connelly, who is a lesbian, and isn't sure about which way to go. michael rapaport is a kid from idaho who falls in with a group of neo-nazis and their leader is cole hauser. those are the three main characters and laurence fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them. it's a great film and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie.
