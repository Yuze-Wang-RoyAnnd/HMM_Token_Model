i found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis. when leo, the oldest announces that he is hiv+ the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange.<br /><br />i have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one; nor one as likely to shout at each other. i didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult i found this a thoroughly moving film.<br /><br />
