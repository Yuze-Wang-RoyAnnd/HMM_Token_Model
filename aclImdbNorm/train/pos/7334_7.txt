watching fire and ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year. it wasn't at all a bad movie, certainly not average, but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimensional (which, perhaps as based on frank miller's comic book, was the right decision to go with). but its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword-led combat, with the occasional freaky creature or super-hot female to go with the painterly surroundings. while i would probably re-watch fire and ice before 300 again, they both aroused that similar feeling - the exception this time being, naturally, that it's frank frazetta, the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics, collaborating with director ralph bakshi, in what isn't typical hollywood fare but something for the die-hard fans.<br /><br />what this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time (it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their masters of the universe vhs tapes back in the day) is the possible cons mentioned before and, maybe, that you will see something somewhat unique. fire and ice isn't even the only bakshi rotoscoped feature, but it's possibly the most fluid- if not quite my personal favorite- of the few he made, and he and his team create a whole striking world that's part pre-historic, part out-of-this-world fantastic, and part medieval, and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds, the skies and grounds. there's a slight drawback for bakshi fans in this facet of character design; bakshi went as far as to say it's more frazetta than him. this may be true, but it doesn't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don't see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion (my favorite was the momentary skeleton-guide- how they rotoscoped that amazes me).<br /><br />i neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it. if you're already a die-hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a 'damsel' or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada, so suffice to say it's about, well, fire against ice, with characters named nekron and darkwolf (the coolest male of the lot and most comic-book in appearance) and teegra (the typical hottie who's almost *too* perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure). what the plot does do, as an asset, is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action, the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle, like when the ogres are hunting after teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes. and per usual for bakshi, he conjures up some craziness (if not quite his usual inspired lunacy) in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material. if you've seen wizards, you'll understand what i mean to a lesser extent.<br /><br />so, if you're an animation buff, seek this out right away for some 'old-school' (i.e. 1980s) action and incredible design. for everyone else, it's... good, not great, as i would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension, with some alterations, 300.
