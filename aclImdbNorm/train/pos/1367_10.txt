this movie was such a blast! it has that feel-good, yet totally in your face attitude that draws me to a movie. it has a good message (party girl decides she needs a real job) yet she doesn't completely lose all sense of fun. i recommend this movie for anyone who needs some humor, but is also a thinker! :)
