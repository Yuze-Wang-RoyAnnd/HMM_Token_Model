after reading the book, i happened across this dvd at wal-mart for 3 bucks and thought, sure, what the hell... i got the dvd and watched it last night. when i started watching it, i checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes. i thought, ok cool... it seemed to run rather slowly, knowing the story and how much of it there was. by the time i got to the actual killings, i was like, "how much time does this have left?" checked. "one minute?! what the hell?!" i felt incredibly cheated, thinking that the movie only progressed through a third of the overall story.<br /><br />but then, i happily noticed that the dvd's scene selection menu included a part 1 and a part 2. i still had another hour and a half to go! i then sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the movie, even more so than the first.<br /><br />i admit that i have not seen the 1967 original film (despite my sincerest desire to), i have however read the novel and felt that this was a fairly descent film, for a two-part tv miniseries, that is. i think the casting of the role of perry was completely wrong and a few minor inconsistencies jumped out at me, but still very well done. the first half drags on a bit, while the second half is much more gripping. i think they should have proportioned the movie more like capote did his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 after, and 1/3 after the killers are arrested. instead, the film makes it more 1/2 before the murders, 1/4 after, and 1/4 after the killers are arrested. again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time, less compelling while making the first half drag on and on...<br /><br />now i look back and realize i have just made the same mistake about making things drag on and on, so i will shut the hell up. go watch the movie and make up your own damn mind! <br /><br />nick houston
