if this movie proves only one thing, it's that keaton is, was and always will be a comic at heart, even when dodging bullets, heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison.<br /><br />but "johnny dangerously" goes on to prove even more. in the '80s, the zaz boys (zucker, abrahams, zucker) were the pinnacle in the world of genre spoofs. but there were several pretenders to the throne. this time, amy ("fast times at ridgement high") heckerling tries her hand, with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script (go and check). <br /><br />this slap-happy slapstick spoof of the 1930's cops-and-"gag"sters movies throws just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few cliches that didn't exist way back when.<br /><br />and not only is the ever-dependable keaton on hand as the johnny of the title, but so are such funny guys and dolls as piscopo, henner, stapleton, boyle, dunne, devito, walston and just about every other actor in hollywood that happened to walk into the immediate vicinity. you'd be surprised by how many faces you'll recognize. i know i was.<br /><br />and the jokes? well, when they start out, they come at you fast and furious, like a machine gun. there are too many to count in the beginning, topped off with a crazy theme song by weird al yankovic. but you have to watch for when they reload. and they have to reload a little too often. <br /><br />everyone tries, they seem to be having fun and i was laughing a good amount of the time. in the end, though, there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier - not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy.<br /><br />but for a slow night when there's nothing good on tv, pop in "johnny" and be ready for some "dangerously" serious laughter.<br /><br />eight stars. check out "johnny dangerously"... don't be a "bastidge".
