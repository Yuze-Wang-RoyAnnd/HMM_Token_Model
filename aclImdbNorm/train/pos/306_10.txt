well, i had seen "they all laughed" when it came out in<br /><br />europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it. i 've just seen it again on tape, almost twenty years after... bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also. excellent comedians and actors, good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing, too. i laughed and smiled all the time. just as we all do, at times. go get it.
