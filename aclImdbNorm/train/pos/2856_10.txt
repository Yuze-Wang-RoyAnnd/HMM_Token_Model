this is one of the movies that get better every time you see them. it's packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. as in sabu's subsequent movies (i didn't see "unlucky monkey" yet, but the other ones are as great) failure, chance and humanism play great roles. the cutting and montage is inventive and artistic, without the movie being an "art" picture, but a highly entertaining one. when comparing it to "run, lola, run" you have to keep in mind that "dangan ranna" was made some years before and was shown on german tv as early as 1997...so it's more probable that it served as inspiration for tom tykwer's movie, and not the other way around. complementary to the other reviews i have to add that i like the acting and the ending very much. this movie is a lot of fun in many ways, and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.
