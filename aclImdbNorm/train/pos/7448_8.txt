i haven't laughed that much in a long time - although the movie has some sad moments too, especially when it changes from hyper-funny to honest and serious. the characters are very realistic most of the times, sappy sometimes, but quite believable. i am not a fan of the jerry springer show - i feel sorry for the participating people. this film instead is a satire, and it is doing great.<br /><br />too bad that all expletives were *beeped* out while this movie aired on public tv, that takes a lot of fun out of it. i will go rent this movie to fully enjoy it.<br /><br />
