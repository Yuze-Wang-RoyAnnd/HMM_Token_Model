a warm, touching movie that has a fantasy-like quality.<br /><br />ellen burstyn is, as always, superb.<br /><br />samantha mathis has given many great performances, but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory.<br /><br />most of all, you've got to see this amazing 5-yr. old, jodelle ferland. i was so captivated by her presence, i had to buy the movie so i could watch her again and again. she is a miracle of god's creation.<br /><br />judging by the high imdb rating, i'm not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress.
