this is the best and most original show seen in years. the more i watch it the more i fall in love with it. the cast is excellent, the writing is great. i personally like every character. however, there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life. i believe abc has done a disservice to the writers, actors and to the potential audience of this show, to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following. there are so few shows i watch anymore as most tv is awful . this show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites greys anatomy and brothers and sisters. in fact i think the same audience for brothers and sisters would love this show if they even knew about it. why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away. i am so sick of reality shows i do not watch any of them. it was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors, this show had so much promise. the recent episode was the best one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so real. please watch this show on abc's video and let abc know you wish to have this show back. please sign the online petition to abc: http://www.petitiononline.com/gh1215/petition.html
