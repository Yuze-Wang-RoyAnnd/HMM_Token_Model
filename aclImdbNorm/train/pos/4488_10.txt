here is a favorite tom & jerry cartoon perfect for halloween. i know it dosen't have much creepiness, but has the 'trick' as in "trick or treat," as jerry did to tom with the window blind and the vacuum-cleaner with a collared-shirt hanging on it to make it like a ghost; but still like to put it on my list of halloween cartoons. in this short, tom was listening to the "witching hour," a ghost-story program on the radio, and being frightened by the horror story being told. halfway into the story, the dramatics (hair standing on end, heart leaping into throat, icy chills on spine) begin happening to tom . . . literally. and jerry has been observing the whole thing and laughing to himself, thought he highen tom fears by scaring him.<br /><br />i love the ending, it was a little funny. and you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which tom attacks mammy two shoes; the others being the lonesome mouse, a mouse in the house and nit-witty kitty. and also this short is the first of twenty-five cartoons where tom speaks. the others are the lonesome mouse, the zoot cat, the million dollar cat, the bodyguard, mouse trouble, the mouse comes to dinner, quiet please!, trap happy, solid serenade, mouse cleaning, texas tom, mucho mouse, and the cat above and the mouse below directed by chuck jones.
