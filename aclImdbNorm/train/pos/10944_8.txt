the sarah silverman program is ... better than those other shows. no laugh tracks, no painful jokes, just a program. the sarah silverman program. if you're like me, and you love comedy, this is probably a show for you.<br /><br />sarah silverman brings out-there-funny, and right-here-funny to the table with ease. a mix of different styles, which makes for its own.<br /><br />this program isn't something you want to start a compare war with, seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other shows). this show is its own entity, and i think most comedy heads will like it just fine.<br /><br />go watch and see.
