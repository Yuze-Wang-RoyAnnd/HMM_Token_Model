riget ii is a good sequel, but not quite as good as the first one. this series don't seem to be quite as serious as the first one. there are much more comedy in this, good one, though.<br /><br />we're back at the danish rigshospitalet, the danish national hospital. mrs. drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done, but fate want's it otherwise. she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and it's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdom.<br /><br />this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous. by all means lot of fun, but it makes you take the series a little less serious. the story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones. it's well written, but some of the new elements are just kind of silly, but they save it by making it more like a comedy. good story, but not as good, original and thrilling as the first series.<br /><br />the actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast. they are all very good. it's an odd story and setting. some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job. yet, these actors handle this whole situation perfectly.<br /><br />much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact. the cinematography is one of those qualities. the hand-held camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series. it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities. good, movement, great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first. also be prepared to see some more. i didn't think that green thing looked all too good. thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit. never the less, the effects like the ghosts are really good. the non-digital effects looks good too. little brother looks just really odd, but you accept it. all over i'd say effects are from ok to good.<br /><br />the music is also quite good. moody and nice. some of it are really touching. it fits really nice. as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well.<br /><br />all together this makes a good sequel. if you'd seen riget you can see this one without being disappointed. it has many of the same qualities as the first series. however, i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. these two makes up a series you don't wanna miss.
