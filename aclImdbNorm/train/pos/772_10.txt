love is overwhelming... in all it's manifestations... gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous... tudor chirila, maria popistasu and ioana barbu, one truly dramatic story about love in all it's shapes, a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts, about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of tudor giurgiu. with a magnificent soundtrack featuring faultline & chris martin and vama veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love... truly remarkable... is it me or is romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect? this is a brilliant film... two thumbs up to everybody involved.
