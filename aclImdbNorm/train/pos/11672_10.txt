excellent pirate entertainment! it has all the good ingredients to keep one's attention -- an absorbing tale of intrigue, a fiery lady pirate named spitfire stevens (maureen o'hara) who's attracted to the irresistible mr. hawke (errol flynn) who is out on a secret mission of his own. they make a fine romantic pair onscreen -- sigh!<br /><br />anthony quinn is the mean, bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer. i noticed the very familiar face of mildred natwick playing a supporting role as mrs. macgregor, the protector of young princess patma (alice kelley).<br /><br />there is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay. lots of action too of sword fighting clashes, ship battles, daring leaps of errol flynn (robin hood on board ship!). from the flaming redhead herself i once heard in an interview of maureen o'hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo flynn in sword fighting in those days but there'd be no need to put it to the test here.<br /><br />very enjoyable movie.
