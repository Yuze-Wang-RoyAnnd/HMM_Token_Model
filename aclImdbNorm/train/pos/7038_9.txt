"the first war to be 100% outsourced." dan ackroyd's line says it all. this is a hard to describe film; comedy, satire, action, screwball. it reminded once or twice of dr. strangelove, especially so in the scenes featuring ben kingsley (who did a remarkable job i think). i had no particular expectations of this film, though i am a big john cusack fan, so i just let the movie wash over me. and as a result i was quite entertained. the political satire is painfully accurate and quite damning of the us military-business complex. the sub-plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving of story lines made them all worthwhile. i can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the us, but for the rest of the world, it is a timely tale.
