a number of posters have commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. this is always a problem with long, complex dramas. crime is essentially banal, so the pay off is always anti-climactic, whilst detailed exposition detracts from the human drama. the writer has used a number of clever devices to try and get round this, but has not been entirely successful. answers to precisely what happened and why may have been supplied, but if so they are well buried. the viewer inevitably feels a little cheated.<br /><br />but in a sense this is unimportant. the drama was never about the crime, or even the investigation, it was about the impact of events on the lives of those involved; the family, the investigators, the witnesses, the press. and as such it was gripping. the writing was a significant cut above the run of the mill for prime-time drama, and the performances uniformly good. in an ensemble piece it is invidious to focus on individuals, but penelope wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the mother-wife-daughter, and janet mcteer was in cracking form as a hard-bitten old cop.<br /><br />one of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of race, as the elephant in the room that no-one is prepared to mention. subtle, powerful stuff.
