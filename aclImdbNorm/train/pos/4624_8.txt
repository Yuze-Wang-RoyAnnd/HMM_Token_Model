believe it or not, inspector gadget's last case is what got me hooked on the whole gadget thing.<br /><br />my name is miriam and i am twelve years old, so obviously i wasn't around when inspector gadget was at the top of his career. sure, i'd heard of him, but i didn't really know him.<br /><br />while reading, note that i never saw the original series (i would if it came on!). this is just about the only gadget thing i've ever watched (even though i am now obsessed) and i will be focusing on what i liked about it since everyone else is so negative. for all you pessimists, i've got some cons down there, too. =p first off, for a childish sense of humor, you could deem this movie pretty funny. i thought it was, so sue me. i also thought the animation and character designs were good, and i'm also happy there was more gadget in it, since he's my favorite character. (i do not like penny.) then there was claw (his voice was awful, though) and the madcat; i thought they were done fairly good too. gadget's idiocy seemed pretty well in place, if not a bit exaggerated (i.e. sucking his hat-hand thing's thumb. would make a good screen shot, though. =p) oh, and i liked the song that ran in the credits. yes, i am strange.<br /><br />and, like all movies, there are some negatives, too.<br /><br />talking cars? what's up with that? you can tell this was aimed at younger boys. that wouldn't bother me quite so much if there wasn't the fact that the cars basically saved the day. i would have much preferred if penny and brain had taken their place. and, apparently, gadget loved his car more than would be called natural. a bit weird, to say the least.<br /><br />oh, and the chief was downright mean to gadget. i mean, sheesh, yeah, he wasn't always the most cheerful of people, but he didn't hate gadget, from what i've read. like the inspector, his personality was exaggerated.<br /><br />well, that's pretty much all i have to say about this movie. i thought the animation made up for the car-centered plot and that it was overall pretty decent; more so than the live-action gadget films (butchered, butchered, butchered!) at least. maybe i'm just biased because this is what got me into gadget in the first place, or maybe my mind is twisted, or maybe i'm just odd, but i really liked this movie, even if i'm the oldest it's recommended for.
