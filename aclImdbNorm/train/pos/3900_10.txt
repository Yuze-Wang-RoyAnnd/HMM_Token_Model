this is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows i've ever seen. i laughed so hard, i'm sure i missed half the jokes. this showcases izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is. what i particularly like is that he seems never to be "dumbing down" the material for his audience. his timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags. thumbs way up.
