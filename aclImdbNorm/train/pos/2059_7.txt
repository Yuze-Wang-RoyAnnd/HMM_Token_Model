what a fun b-movie! shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is a distinct and original. he really brought me back to the monsters of the 80's. the budget is obviously low and not everybody is pacino behind the lens but it doesn't matter because it never once takes itself seriously. from the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial arts moves of the scarecrow, this is truly a b-movie gem. grab some refreshments, snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax. i enjoyed this film so much i went out a purchased all 3 scarecrow films. sure, they're not for everybody but to each his own. sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile.
