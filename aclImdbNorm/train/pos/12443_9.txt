i enjoyed this film. it was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of peter o'donnell.<br /><br />a number of people have disliked the film, but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is. the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became. before the network. before willie garvin.<br /><br />the pace is a trifle slow, and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes. however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version.<br /><br />if you like modesty blaise, you will enjoy it even with its faults, if you just want an action flick with car chases - forget it.<br /><br />it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise, but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere, i suspect there will be no more to follow. sadly.
