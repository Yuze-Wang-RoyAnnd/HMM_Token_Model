a classic series that should be at least repeated or released on dvd.billy toth,after realising he is adopted after the death of his parents,embarks on a journey to find his real parents.after various rites of passage,his search culminates in the discovery that his fathers identity was stolen and used by a human trafficker in europe!if i remember correctly,the series ends on the austrian(?] ski slopes and a cliff top chase resulting in the death of billys fathers betrayer. this series was all filmed on location in various destinations round europe and appeared polished and incredibly well made with some episodes crossing into the realms of film noir and crime thriller.the main arc was often eclipsed by the slices of life that billy went through during his years of toiling to find his mother and fathers secrets.a class act but underrated and forgotten.
