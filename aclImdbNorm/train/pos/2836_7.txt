recap: zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with thierry. thierry himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way. he has submerged himself in work, laid of his writing, and zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them. into this enters johnny, and old friend of thierry's who once were artists in exile together. but johnny has kept on painting, and just have a day job for the rent. he takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny. there is an instant raw attraction between zandalee and johnny, and they enter into an affair. but zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband. but none of them, not zandalee, not johnny and not thierry can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control.<br /><br />comments: it is set as a thriller. but maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it's about life and death, and threat of violence. not that a thriller of heart can't take on fatal proportions, but the threat comes from a different angle. and it is not really until the second half in zandalee until the thriller emerges, and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half, i can't really describe the genre as a thriller then. much more of a romantic drama than anything else, but with the underlying currents of other genres. the developing thriller is there, but it also has more than a little tint of a sensual erotic kind. because that is what it is all about, what drives the characters and therefore the entire story. desire. the need to have, and the need to be.<br /><br />in my opinion it is quite good, definitely a lot better than its current (4.1) rating anyway. it takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense, and it handles the erotic part very well, with taste. it is always an integral part of the story, needed to be there to give the story it's needed weight, and i never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that. but unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end, and the end itself feels kind of flat, even if in its own way kind of dramatic.<br /><br />the cast is impressive, spearheaded by known actors like nicholas cage and judge reinhold. but the show is almost completely stolen by erika anderson. beautiful and very adept at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire, she excels were both cage and reinhold sometimes goes a bot overboard and become a little rough. her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in zandalee, i can only hope it is because of her own choices. also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie, it is steve buscemi and joe pantoliano.<br /><br />when you're in the right mood this is a very good movie, it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves.<br /><br />7/10
