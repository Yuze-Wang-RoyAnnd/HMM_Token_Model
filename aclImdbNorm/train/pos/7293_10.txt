what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film? i saw this at the atlanta, georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town. i am very much a sci-fi aficionado and enjoy action type films. i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning. this is not a sci-fi nor action film of any sort. let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari, having watched a few episodes(his performance in that seemed stale and robotic). but he managed to really win me over in this performance. i mean really win me over. having seen cellular, i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy. but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing. he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon. but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me. i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect. now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them (sorry brian). they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story - which i think was even more his goal(seeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off). i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head. the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one. i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse. this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend.
