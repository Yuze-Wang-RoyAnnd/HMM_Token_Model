paul reiser is one of my favorite people in show business. i have read both of his books and think that he is great. peter faulk can deliver a punch line with the best of them. the combination of the two is magic.<br /><br />this is a story about a family really getting to know each other. through a road trip a father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the midts of a family crisis. they do all the things that fathers and sons are suppose to do in life...they are just doing them much later in life. the situations are very funny, but have the feeling that they could actually happen to people in real life (not obsurdly over the top or cartoonish). this is the first time that i watch paul reiser and fully believed every emotion that was portrayed. at times, his eyes look so sad.<br /><br />gret movie and great story and plot. it has comedy and emotion but an uplifting message...olympia dukakas does a great job also :)
