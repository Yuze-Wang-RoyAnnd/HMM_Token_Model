this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun. but, i appreciated this light-hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level. think about it--the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland, a bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback who kills mccoy, and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end. despite all the danger, you just can't take everything very seriously--it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. so, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great stuff.
