this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would-be librarians. all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship. the public library vs. academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students. it also breaks many librarian stereotypes. librarians might even be capable of having fun -- even if they don't *usually* have sex in the romance languages section! (the best movie about librarians? desk set, with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy, of course.)
