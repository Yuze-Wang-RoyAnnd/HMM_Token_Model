this is the ultimate one-man show in which eddie murphy is at his very best. just forget the nutty professor and the distinguished gentlemen, this is the real eddie murphy. his imitations of mr. t. (pretending he is gay), michael jackson and other artists are killers. i think it's also quite daring to make fun of artists who where really popular in that time. my favorite act is the one where he is at his annual bbq with the family and plays his drunken dad and aunt bunny who falls from the stairs.<br /><br />this show is the best medicine when you feel down ! if you watch the sequel 'raw' don't be disappointed. it's quite good too but doesn't match 'delirious'.
