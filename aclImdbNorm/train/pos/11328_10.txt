this movie is great. if you enjoy watching b-class movies, that is. this is a classic college 80's slasher movie, in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack. a horrible film, but worth renting to make fun of, or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives. kinda funny, if you ask me.
