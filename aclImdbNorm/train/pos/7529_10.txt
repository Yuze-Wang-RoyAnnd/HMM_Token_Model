two years passed and mostly everyone looks different, some for good and some for worse. i still enjoyed as much as i did the original though.<br /><br />some flaws they had though like changing the joker he now has no red lips and looks like more blackish hair and black pupils, hes still voiced by mark hamill which is a plus i guess. they made poison ivy more white hinting that she is becoming more like a plant and catwomen looks much different and not as "attractive" as she was in the original.<br /><br />though costumes like batman, batgirl, killer croc and scarecrow look badass, especially scarecrow.<br /><br />the show isn't as dark as the original because batman doesn't work as alone as he used to. most of the time working with batgirl and the new robin, tim drake. while nightwing(dick grayson) comes to the rescue often. batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of ass.<br /><br />the show isn't as good as the original mostly because of some of the revamped characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "over the edge" might be one of the greatest batman episodes ever so make sure you check that out.<br /><br />overall 8-9/10
