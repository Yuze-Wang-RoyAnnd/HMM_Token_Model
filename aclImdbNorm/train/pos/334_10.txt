it's very simple to qualify that movie: "a pure masterpiece". this opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, they seem to be citizens of that epoch, 1100 b.c. they personalize perfectly the characters. a second reason is that the poetry expressed by homere in his poem is well given by the production. among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition. third reason: the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect, in mediterranean regions, where the action of the poem occurred. and most of all, the emotion is on the rendezvous. i repeat my appreciation: "a pure masterpiece".
