here, on imdb.com i read an opinion, that grey owl is best character of pierce brosnan ever performed. i do not know if he had better nor worse roles, i'm not his fan, but this one was really exceptional.<br /><br />the other thing - impressive hand of the movie director. i give my respect. the serenity, the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively, i never met such proximity it in any movie before.<br /><br />another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie, closest to the original books, and atmosphere in it. <br /><br />and little bit more. i pay my respect to the original grey owl.
