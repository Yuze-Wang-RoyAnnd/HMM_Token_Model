an unmarried, twenty-something hick (played by john travolta) leaves the farm and goes to houston, where he learns about life and love in a texas honky-tonk. at face value, it's a modern love story ... texas style. there's gobs of cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer signs, and references to big belt-buckles and rodeos. the music, if not texas native, is texas adapted, courtesy of the talents of mickey gilley, johnny lee, and the charlie daniels band. and that texas twang ... "y'all".<br /><br />the story and the characters are about as subtle as the taste of texas five-alarm chili made with jalapeno peppers. it's enough to make civilized viewers abort the film in favor of a genteel classic, one starring laurence olivier or ingrid bergman, maybe. "hamlet" it's not. but "urban cowboy" is spicy and explicit, and i kinda like it.<br /><br />technically, the film is generally good. the dialogue, the production design, and the costumes are all realistic; the editing is skillful. and both the casting and the acting are commendable, if not oscar worthy. i would not have cast travolta in the role he plays, but he does a fine job ... ditto debra winger. barry corbin and brooke alderson, among others, are good too, in support roles. but, the cinematography seemed weak. the film copy i watched was grainy, and at times suffered from a reddish/orange tint, a visual trait i have noticed in other films from the same time period.<br /><br />at first glance, the film does not seem to offer any social or political "message". but i would argue that when "urban cowboy" was released twenty-five years ago, it had rather prophetic implications. in 1980 the u.s. had all kinds of problems, not the least being american hostages held by iran. in the minds of a lot of folks back then, the u.s. was being pushed around, bullied.<br /><br />this film, along with others of its time, offered something that americans wanted to see in their political leaders ... toughness. "urban cowboy" is a very physical film. the characters in it may not be the brightest people on earth. but, they're tough!<br /><br />everything about "urban cowboy" is anti-intellectual. as a vehicle for cultural expression then, this 1980 film was one of several that augured a new get-tough era for the u.s. it started in 1980 with the election of reagan. and that era continues to this day, with a president who probably will not be remembered for his intellect, but will be remembered for his toughness and aggression, traits that americans seem to gravitate to as surely as texans to five-alarm chili.
