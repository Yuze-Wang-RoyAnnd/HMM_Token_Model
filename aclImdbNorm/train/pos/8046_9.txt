who knew they could be so funny?? christopher meloni and janel moloney are known more for their outstanding work in some of television's hottest dramas. ("law & order: svu" and "the west wing") put them together on the big screen and what you get is an engaging romantic comedy with plenty of laughs.<br /><br />the actors develop the story's ongoing relationship with impressive skill, leaving the audience bound to fall in love with barry singer (meloni), despite the fact he's a standup comic who also happens to be a mean-spirited, sexist jerk.<br /><br />you'll be rooting for him even as he takes all his insecurities with the opposite sex and chases thea (moloney) halfway around the country in hopes of winning her heart. they have so little in common...but when barry finally opens his heart, you'll wonder why thea keeps running away.<br /><br />the souler opposite is a wonderful movie with an incredible cast and a gifted writer. well worth your time.<br /><br />
