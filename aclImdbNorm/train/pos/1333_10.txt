i love this movie very much i watched it over and over. i don't see why anyone would think this movie wasn't good. maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it. it is one of my favorite movies and i am not hindi at all but i do love it. it might be a little like "pretty woman" but i haven't seen that and i don't think it's any better than this. i don't know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but i think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie, and to those who say it's not good at all well then i wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good. as for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people don't like it. as for rani mukherjee ( i think thats how you spell her last name) she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!
