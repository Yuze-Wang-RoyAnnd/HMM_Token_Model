a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town, leading to all kinds of complications. cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town. hopper does what he does best, playing a psycho known as "lyle from dallas," the real hit man. walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast. the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns, and john's direction creates a terrific "neo noir" atmosphere. witty and very entertaining, it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up.
