dark comedy? gallows humor? how does one make a comedy out of murder? it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people. so, the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work. so, pierce brosnan, the irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-smoking, sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis. he meets a struggling businessman, greg kinnear, and after a rocky beginning, he learns that he needs a friend. but, greg's happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have, love, home and a life. add character actor, philip baker hall as the hit-man's manager and we're off to the races. brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti-hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart, the very human businessman. hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnear's very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives. the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it. you should leave the theater feeling, at least, partly good-- if you're able to suspend being aghast at killing people.
