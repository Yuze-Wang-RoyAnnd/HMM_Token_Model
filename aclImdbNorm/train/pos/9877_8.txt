<br /><br />presenting lily mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system. ok now that you know my bias, here are some reasons i think this movie does stand out.<br /><br />1. although the basic plot - lily mars (judy garland) goes to new york, becomes a star, and wins the heart of her director (van heflin) is a pretty stock hollywood story of the period, the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual. although lily gets her big break when the star quits, she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show.<br /><br />2. judy garland (enough said!)<br /><br />3. the supporting cast includes some really great performances. spring byington as lily's mother is truely wonderful, as is fay bainter (the mother of the director - john thornway (van heflin)). the standout supporting performance though goes to character actress connie gilchrist as frankie, a one time actress turned theater custodian.<br /><br />worth a watch for sure. one of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
