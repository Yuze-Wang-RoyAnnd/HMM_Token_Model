strangely erotic schlock gothic horror that will be loved by hammer house of horror fans the world over. appears to be an interesting take on "beauty and the beast". it is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era.<br /><br />corsets, castles, rutting horses, rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods, proof that no-one had a brazilian in the 70's, and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at, what more could you possibly want?!<br /><br />it certainly brightened my sunday afternoon!
