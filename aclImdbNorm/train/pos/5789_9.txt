this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing "sandy" and the agnes moorhead-and-the-tiny-spacemen episodes.<br /><br />it is an important take, from mid-1961, on the long cold war that the u.s. was then embroiled in. the beaten-down city-scene, the near-starving characters' sparse dialog, their threadbare uniforms, and the minimal action "says" it all: the absurdity of an on-going conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization, and all that is sweet and redeeming about it.<br /><br />it is a "fable" because it was made in a time in which, had events turned out differently, such as the second berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent cuban missile crisis (oct. 1962), it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u.s.'s major cities, ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors. i also see it as a "fable" because it is not only a cautionary tale, but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths: it is a love story, set in an impossible situation, and involving two highly mismatched lovers.
