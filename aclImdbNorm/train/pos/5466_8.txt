excellent, pre-code amoral tale with barbara stanwyck as the newly inspired (by writings of nietzsche!) to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself, use men to her advantage. not really fair on the german philosopher but interesting that this was the year hitler came to power. stanwyck, even in this young version doesn't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here, ever driving herself and the film forward. not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqu'e situations and astonishing quips and innuendo. great fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and i suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female. still, that's life!
