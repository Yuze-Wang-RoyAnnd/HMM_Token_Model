<br /><br />artisticly shot, actors portray exactly their role. you get a real feeling watching lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around. a sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again. all in all i have seen this film at least 10 times. and can very well say that prix de beute' (the beauty prize, miss europe) is a major favorite in my silent film collection. the expressiveness of louise brooks is perfect and i recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line.
