perfect cast for a few-person drama. simon is dead but somehow resurrects from outside. what he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by german avant-garde composer werner henze. simon is haunted by his death, comforted by support of death people he'd seen on the other side. his girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to, decides to follow him after his finally occurring death. very touchy and moving, deeply psychological, but a bit slow and somewhere even boring.
