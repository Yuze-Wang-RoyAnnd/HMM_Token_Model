jim henson's muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood. this film makes me feel like a kid again. okay, the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends. the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city. you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch. anyway, the film turns 25 this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang. the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city. it's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself.
