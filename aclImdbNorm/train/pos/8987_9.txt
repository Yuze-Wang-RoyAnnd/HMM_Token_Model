i recently rented this doc, having remembered hearing about it from imdb.com and being intrigued by the premise. i knew very little about either of these bands, but i do remember hearing "not if you were the last junkie on earth" by the dandy warhols ages ago and enjoying it. that being said, this is my perspective on the doc:<br /><br />one thing i found incredible about this film is there is no need to have any prior knowledge of either of these bands. the director (ondi timoner) wastes no time in engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this film. i quickly became grooved to the lives both anton and courtney as well as their respective bands, the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols. i think that is part of what makes this doc so good, and what makes ondi timoner such a master documentarian.<br /><br />i also loved how the "story" of these bands was told. most of what you see is of the bands on tour. both bands start out playing small venues and struggling to make it in the recording industry. throughout the film, each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. however it is this that makes the two bands similar, and thus the brilliant perspective on how two bands of a feather can go in such different directions.<br /><br />i would basically recommend this for anyone who likes film in general. you do not need to have a particular love for documentaries, or either of the bands. an appreciation for music helps, but the music itself takes a backseat to the love/hate relationship between the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols.
