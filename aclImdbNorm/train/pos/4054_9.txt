the first time i ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad. my dad actually recorded it off the tv. i must have watched is over 20 times, before the relatively recent release on dvd.<br /><br />i of course bought and watched the dvd and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed. in the first version, which i still have on vhs, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. however the new version, featuring van der beek et al, is more comic.<br /><br />to put it another way, it's like watching the original us release of akira with that dub, before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the japanese.<br /><br />i'm in no way complaining, the story and quality of animation are not detracted from, but it does raise the question of whether miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film.....
