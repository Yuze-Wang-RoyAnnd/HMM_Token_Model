i have not read the book that this was based upon/inspired by. this being some of(the others are film roles) the last work of john ritter(rip), one hopes that it is hilarious. and it is. almost every time he's present in this, as a matter of fact. most of the cast, supporting as well as regular, play off each other well, and the material tends to be great. he plays paul hennessy, the father of three teenagers: rory, the typical guy of that age, kerry, the depressive middle-child who fights for causes and awareness, and bridget, the fashion-loving, popular ditz. sagal makes a return to being the female lead in a sit-com, and her character is far removed from peggy bundy. the show changed somewhat after mr. three's company passed on, and for a while, they couldn't seem to make up their minds if they wanted to go for getting laughs, or being poignant and making sure to be respectful. one can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that: it could still be quite good, some of the additions were fortunate(if you like david spade, most of his part consists of him doing his schtick) and had stuff to say. my personal favorite episode is in the last season. the humor is a nice mix of "dumb person" jokes(mainly related to the high-schoolers), silliness, dark comedy and crude material. this dealt with sex and other adult topics, but never in a graphic manner. the language is mild, and, on occasion, moderately strong. i recommend this to any fan of those who made it. 8/10
