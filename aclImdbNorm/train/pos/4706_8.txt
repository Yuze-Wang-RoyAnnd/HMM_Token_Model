sure it may not be a classic but it's one full of classic lines. one of the few movies my friends and i quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later (maybe it was on cinemax one too many times!) michael keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie--he can't seem to figure out how to play it-- but he's surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof. looking for a movie to cheer you up? this is it but rent it with friends--it'll make it even better.
