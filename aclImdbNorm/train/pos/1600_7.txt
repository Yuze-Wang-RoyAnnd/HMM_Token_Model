this is not a bad film. it is not wildly funny, but it is interesting and<br /><br />entertaining. it has a few funny moments. cher gives a good<br /><br />performance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self. her<br /><br />performance alone is worth the watch. if this movie had come out<br /><br />today it would not have been nominated, but by '80s standards it<br /><br />was excellent.
