jonathan demme's directorial debut for roger corman's legendary exploitation outfit new world pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks-in-chains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid. beauteous russ meyer starlet eric ("vixen," "beyond the valley of the dolls") gavin gives a robust, winning performance as a brassy, resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy, hellish penitentiary. the always fabulous barbara steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean, crippled, sexually frustrated warden (her erotic dream about doing a slow, steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly). longtime favorite 70's b-movie actress roberta ("the arousers," "unholy rollers") collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward, foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut-busting dirty joke about pinnochio. lynda gold (a.k.a. crystin sinclaire of tobe hooper's "eaten alive" and curtis harrington's "ruby") makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat crazy alice. and the ever-cuddly cheryl "rainbeaux" smith does a lovely, touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from "lemora: a child's tale of the supernatural." <br /><br />although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language, nudity, rape and violence, it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force. demme's zesty, confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior. furthermore, both tak fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and john cale's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100% on the money excellent. patrick wright (sheriff mack in the uproariously awful cheap-rubber-monster-suit creature feature howler "track of the moonbeast") has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom. lively, rousing and immensely enjoyable, "caged heat" qualifies as absolutely essential viewing for 70's drive-in movie fans.
