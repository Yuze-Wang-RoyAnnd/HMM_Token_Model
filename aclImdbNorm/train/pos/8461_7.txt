since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english, i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing(2000) as presented in the bandai released dvd set. my actual review for the whole series is under imdb's entry of ""shin kid^o senki gundam w"(1995).<br /><br />very little is changed in respect to plot, script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in. purists can stick to japanese all they want, but for a more "realistic" experience i recommend the english track since all the characters, except heero yuy, are not japanese.(most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non-japanese asians.) for one thing, the characters' personalities come across more "directly" than in the japanese version. the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give-or-take performances but a very well cast group of actors.<br /><br />wing gundam's pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity. voiced by mark hildreth who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as "bad acting" but it matches heero's personality very well.<br /><br />deathscythe gundam's duo maxwell, ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends. he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show, masterfully played by scott mcneil. he may sound a little too old for his age, but duo's english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one.<br /><br />trowa, the pilot of heavyarms, is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat; despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him, he only knows how to kill, not to befriend. kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton.<br /><br />quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand. a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl(and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version) but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy.<br /><br />the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over-the-top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa.<br /><br />relena darlian sounds older in english, voiced by lisa ann bailey. this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story, her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development.<br /><br />zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version. both voices bring out different sides to the same character. his japanese voice is haughty, authoritative and commands respect , keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature. his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued, sounding more devious and "snake-like", highlighting zechs' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals.<br /><br />the members of oz are a mixed bag really. treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his larger-than-life japanese style of speaking. however, lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds.........bored most of the time. the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either.<br /><br />i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds. the maganac corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents. the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility.<br /><br />despite underwhelming acting from the side characters, the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over-the-top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing's script. very faithful to the original japanese script, keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics, war and human nature. sadly, it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script.
