a complex story laid on the background of partition of bharat. an honest muslim who kidnaps an innocent hindu girl, and an educated hindu who burns the harvest of a muslim man - yet in the end you end up liking them both. the story is powerful, yet the screenplay and flow are hesitant. background music score and the songs are outstanding. next comes memorable acting by veteran urmila matondkar. photography captures the time, the violence, and flavor of rural punjab very well. others actors either did not act well, or did not get a chance to act. direction is really the weakest link. the characters were not developed well. not crisp, in contrast to "the earth", where even a 5-line character leaves a mark. the end is very interesting. this story could have several different ending - and all of them could have been equally good.
