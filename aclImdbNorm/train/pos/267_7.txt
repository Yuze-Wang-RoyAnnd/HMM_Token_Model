it all begins with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students on hickory road, london. concerned for her sister, who is the housekeeper there, miss lemon asks hercule poirot to look into the matter. he agrees, but soon the stakes get higher when a girl, who had admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) of the thefts, is found murdered.<br /><br />"hickory dickory dock" is a solid brain exercise, without being as mind-numbingly complicated as "one, two, buckle my shoe". murder, theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved, and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! the characters are interesting, particularly the psychology student colin mcnabb and the mysterious american girl sally finch, inspector japp has his funny moments (in perhaps the closest this series has come to "toilet humor"), and miss lemon gets a more integral part to the story than usual.
