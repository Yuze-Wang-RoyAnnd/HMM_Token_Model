<br /><br />there is star trek canon -- lots of it. from canon we know the history of the future. advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc.<br /><br />enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon. an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans. as one, i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there -- but no.<br /><br />the phase pistols, like much of the technology, look much more modern than found in tos. an old style starfleet laser gun, a slow gold speckle transporter effect -- that's what i expected to see. also, i did not expect to hear pure beep-based sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects. <br /><br />in the earliest view of tos (the original pilot: the cage), we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect -- a bit of old earth navy. with enterprise, we see a shocking disregard for rank. there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprise.<br /><br />it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe (quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice), but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal. unprofessional, unsure, more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series -- and that says a lot!<br /><br />the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel.<br /><br />enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun, warm-fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic, bold, gritty, high-rick exploration of space.<br /><br />i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor. still, i liked the actors for the most part. linda park, an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college, is sure to develop nicely. the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully created.<br /><br />enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series. let's hope for a good future!
