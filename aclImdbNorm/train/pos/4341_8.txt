who doesn't have unresolved issues with parents? and which parents don't have unresolved issues with each other?<br /><br />i know, that sounds heavy. but this is played for laughs in the movie, making both the comedy better and the drama better. i've always like paul reiser and peter falk, and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, i was enchanted from the very first scene.<br /><br />especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person. and peter falk's monologue about being a hard-working, sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point. without that scene being acted so well, the movie would have seemed far less nuanced, and the character far less interesting.<br /><br />nicely done, paul and peter!
