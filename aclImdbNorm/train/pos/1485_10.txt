this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts, i love the final, when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life, but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right, is jut for two, so what are the other persons doing there? the movie embrace you to a new life, to experiences, to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams. also shows you the life itself, hard like it is. but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. hope this comment works for you. the movie it did worked well for me. i bought the movie by the way ;) take care.
