okay, but just plain dumb. not bad for a horror/comedy film. i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe (never seen it) the horror (possibly comedy) uncle sam, i'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on vhs of amazon and got it november 21, the day before thanksgiving. worth the four bucks, l.o.l. at this film.<br /><br />9/10
