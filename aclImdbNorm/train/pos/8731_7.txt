when watching a bug's life for the first time in a long while, i couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's happy feet. as far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special. it just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion. a lot of people disagree with me when i say that i really like pixar's sophomore effort. sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of toy story, nor is the animation out of this world. however, the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. with plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, i could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics.<br /><br />there is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here. between our lead flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony, the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future, and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks, everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story. even the villain hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons. he is not doing it to be mean, but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1. he needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth. it is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages.<br /><br />when thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. compared to antz, the rival film of the time, this is much more realistic and less cartoony. the water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage. you don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production. the reflections and moistness, despite the smooth exterior, shows the realism. all the bugs are finely crafted too. the flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on, whether for a small role or a more expanded one. it is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments. while ant island is nice, it is just the outdoors. bug city contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs. it is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything. from the ice cube trays as circus stands, the animal crackers box as circus wagon
