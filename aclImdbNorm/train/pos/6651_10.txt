gandhi, the great :<br /><br />greatness in the world is associated with people like alexanader the great, ashoka the great for their greatness lied in being glorified as more than humans. gandhi is called great for actually not being a great but being more human, for i always believe bringing out the humanity in us is where the greatness of being human lies.gandhi was a human with humanity and one who strived for humanity ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity but not his enemies. let me move to the movie review now.<br /><br />about gandhi my father :<br /><br />gandhi my father is a film not about gandhi but about his son harilal gandhi.on telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans to walk this earth, the director succeeds in portraying the tale.the film succeeds in telling the story of a mislead son of a father who lead a nation to greatness.the movie is termed as a criticism of gandhi's failure as a father to his son, i would rather say it is of a sacrifice gandhi had made as a father of a son to do justice as a father of a nation.<br /><br />i wish the essence of this movie prevails not just in india, the gandhian land, but through the hearts of all the people of this world.<br /><br />gandhi the true human. jaihind.
