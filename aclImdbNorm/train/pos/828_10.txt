i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10, but that this one isn't even in the top 100.<br /><br />this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:<br /><br />-the rescue of han solo from jabba: this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in a new hope.<br /><br />-the emperor was finally revealled: well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kids.<br /><br />-the speeder bike chase: alright, so this was a special effects moment. but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!<br /><br />-the 3 part climax: 1) the battle of endor (led by han and leia) 2) luke confronts his father & the fall of the emperor 3) the destruction of the second death star (lando's moment)<br /><br />-the final celebration with our heroes: like i said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.<br /><br />all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story.
