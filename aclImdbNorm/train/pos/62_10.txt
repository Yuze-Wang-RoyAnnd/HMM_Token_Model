i absolutely loved this movie. i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it. this movie had so much emotion, and felt so real, i could really sympathize with the characters. every time i watch it, the ending makes me cry. i can really identify with busy phillip's character, and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to me.<br /><br />i think that all high schools should show this movie, maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing. i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody. especially those who have been affected by any school shooting.<br /><br />it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time.
