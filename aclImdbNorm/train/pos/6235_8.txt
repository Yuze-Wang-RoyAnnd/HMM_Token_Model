this is one of the best fred astaire-ginger rogers films, or at least one of my favorites. most of the a-r movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories. this still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films.<br /><br />this movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs. the music is the central theme here and what's nice is the addition of a tap solo by rogers. she not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure. she dances also with fred, of course, and they're always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor.<br /><br />growing up in the 1950s watching "ozzie & harriet" on television, it was a real kick the first time i saw this to see such a young harriet hilliard. no surprise than ozzie fell for this beauty. although she had that short early '30s hairstyle, i recognized her voice right away. also in this movie are quick appearances by betty grable and lucille ball, but i have to admit that i have yet to out ball. i can't find her, but i know she's in here.<br /><br />astaire, except for some obnoxious gum-chewing in the first third of the film, was fun to watch and randolph scott - although better in westerns - is likable, too.<br /><br />this is simply a nice, feel-good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of astaire and rogers.
