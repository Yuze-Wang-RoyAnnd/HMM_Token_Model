obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well. george lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his star wars series seems to a homage to gunga din. the characters that grant, mclaglen, and fairbanks play are just precursors of han solo, luke skywalker, and chewbacca. even sam jaffe's gunga din morphed into c-3po and r2-d2 and like him or not: jar jar binks.<br /><br />today this film is viewed as non pc but there is a speech by eduardo ciannelli as guru the leader of the indian opposition to the british raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today. <br /><br />to a young boy this was a great film. three strong male leads and only a hint of romance. there was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in saturday matinee film was just mush. not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight. too late to lament lost innocence.<br /><br />hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at tcm and catch a film with action, adventure, and a cast of thousands instead of cgi actors.
