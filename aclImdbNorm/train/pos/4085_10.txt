if you were born around the time this movie was finished, and had a liberal/open minded household that i had, i'm sure during the early 80's you'd be first introduced to walking in on your parents watching dirty movies or extreme dirty movies. you know, not 100% pornographic but rather an alchemical mixture of actual drama and pornography, or that you'd sneak into their collection and pop in the plastic rectangle representation of such a film in a big dookie machine called a vhs. you had to be very quiet and ninja like but still having minor heart failure when huge pop noises were made when pressing the tablet-like buttons out of fear of being discovered. whatever the case, such films were sent into the back of your mind, waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual "art". needless to say, this movie fits into the aforementioned description to a "t". many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps due to me being desensitized, i am more disturbed by the subtleties. was the creator speaking to us on deeper levels of human carnality and or what could be considered a true abomination, interracial relations, bed frame masturbation, voyeurism, or could it be desperation for social status to the point of murder, pedophilia/homosexuality, or the repressed sexual nature of social elitist females in 18th century france? who can say, but despite mr. borowcyzk's taste for vivid, raw sexuality being the "norm" for his works, i'd say that indeed this movie does speak to the viewer on a deeper level concerning bestial carnality. once i have learned this, the story became much more interesting beyond the giddiness of shock value and there fore, it is well worth checking out.
