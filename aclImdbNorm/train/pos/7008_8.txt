wow! what - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! i'm not at all a fan of contemporary italian directors. usually i don't like dramas. i am not a will smith super fan even thinking that he is a very good actor......but this movie ! it is such a great movie with a such original script and so good direction and so well acting...wow...it is stunning. this movie captured my attention minute by minute and i even did not like "the pursuit of happiness" (maybe also because i did not like the acting of will's son who is a very bad actor while children usually seems all natural born actors, i saw him also last night in "the day the earth stood still" and i confirmed my sensation that jaden can't act). i don't want to write spoilers and so i don't talk about the story but what i can say is that this movie talks about love, death and other feelings which i don't like to watch in movies....but this movie is such a super great movie. if you have a minimum of heart you'll don't regret watching it
