i have seen the perfect son about three times. i fail to see how this film is a gay film, i am not even gay, but i don't see it as a gay film. it is a film with a gay character, i can't see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay. i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death, the death of someone who is your kin. i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life. i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving, ryan states that he doesn't want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone. isn't that horrific and sad? i highly recommend the film.
