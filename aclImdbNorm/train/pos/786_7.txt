andie macdowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie. when you enter 40 and have been single for a while (or all your life) you may feel you are wasting away. the movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active. i liked the quick sexual encounter, which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher (macdowell). her ex-student is cute enough, still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long. <br /><br />there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or unpractical, though. for example, at a scene where the other women's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make andie macdowell dump the young man, would a mature police officer (the other friend of macdowell) allow her friend to do such a sinister act? is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car? of course accidents happen all the time, but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with (that was the hardest part to believe!! for such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long??)... <br /><br />maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long. beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public, especially to jealousy women over 40, who are waiting some miracles to happen. the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but if the man continued to live, would that last? for how long? nobody knows. nonetheless, it's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later.... a year later maybe.
