i loved this movie. it was so well done! great acting and drama and historically accurate. i love romy schneider movies. this one rocks, not as great as sissi but still rocks! <br /><br />and scorpiolina,she commented and said french dubbing. well this is originally a german movie not french. so yea. second of all there was a plot, maybe your not familiar with history. oh and her mother played the part of her governess, not her teacher. and the storyline was actually not cinderella but queen victoria, maybe u missed that detail.<br /><br />but anyway.... yea the history in this movie is great, i love historical movies and queen victoria is very fascinating! i love all the historical stuff. like that guy that was trying to manipulate her mom. and when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the "new type of dance" waltzing. when waltzing was new it was considered kinda scandalous because the couples dance so close. yea her governess was like oh my god!<br /><br />and also the clothes, i love the clothes. the styles are great, hoop skirts are awesome. and of course romy always looks very pretty.
