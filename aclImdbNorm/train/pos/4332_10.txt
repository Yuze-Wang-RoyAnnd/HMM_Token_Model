paul reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie. peter falk gives the performance of his life. it is worthy of an academy award. this was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year. reiser's wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running tv sitcom "mad about you". peter falk did a masterful job as his dad, and peter who is now 78 years young made us laugh and cry at the same time. the supporting cast was equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous elizabeth perkins. it is a must see movie for 2005. we bet that everyone across all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another. we have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie. we have all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different.
