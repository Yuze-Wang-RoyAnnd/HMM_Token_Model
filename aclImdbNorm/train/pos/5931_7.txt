although written by stephen king, an overrated writer if there ever was one, this is actually quite entertaining b-movie. vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgins, great graveyard scenery, heroic cats and very pretty virgin. the soundtrack even has enya's music, an idea which i found quite... nice. i'm sure king is disappointed to this little movie, although it has crappy dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and tedious king potboiler. (albeit sleepwalkers, if i'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). still, those touches of sewer-odors show he didn't use a ghost-writer after all...
