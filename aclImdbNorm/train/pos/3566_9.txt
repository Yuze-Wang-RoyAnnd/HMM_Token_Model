in 1954 marlon brando was the hot actor after his performances in streetcar named desire and on the waterfront. frank sinatra had yet to re-invent himself on the silver screen. but sinatra's portrayal as the erstwhile nathan detroit, helped re-establish sinatra with his fans.<br /><br />it is a great screen version of a great play and the choices of leads and support players are terrific. imagine a movie where brando sings? this was his one and only singing role as he portrayed sky masterson. in addition the female leads, jean simmons and vivian blaine(replaying her stage role as nathan's long suffering girlfriend adelade), put in superlative efforts. special mention goes to the great stubby kaye(as nicely nicely), and with all due respect to eric clapton, no one's version of rockin' the boat even comes close to stubby's. sheldon leonard, who would go on to fame as tv producer of such shows as the danny thomas show and the dick van dyke show does "harry the horse" wonders, b.s.pulley is excellent as the harsh mannered and rough talking "big julie", and even regis toomey offers his excellence as "brother arvide".<br /><br />it is one of the fun musicals to see, good comedy, and you get sinatra and brando. soooooo "luck be a lady tonight" and brother..."it's your dice"
