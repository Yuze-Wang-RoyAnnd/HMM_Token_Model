hunky geordie robson green is owen springer, a young doctor who moves home to manchester to be near his father. along the way, he falls for anna, a woman 20 years his senior, and who happens to be the wife of his new boss, richard crane. despite warnings from his new colleagues, owen proceeds to get anna for himself, going as far as to sabotage anna and the cheating richard's marriage. this is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit. the actors are superb: green of "the student prince" and "touching evil" smolders on-screen as the cunning, yet warm-hearted owen; annis of "dune" fame is lively and proves a good match to green; kitchen, from "to play the king" is the right menace as richard, whose comic missteps and snobbery underline his masterful, building hatred for owen. this is a perfect love triangle, and despite the foibles and fallacies of our three characters, you come away better for knowing and watching them.
