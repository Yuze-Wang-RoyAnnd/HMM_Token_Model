flavia the heretic is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre - equal parts sleaze, feministic journey, and "history" as we follow flavia on her strange trip.<br /><br />we start off with flavia in a convent...she ain't too happy there cuz she doesn't believe in all the male-dominated "rules" and macho-ism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her jewish pal, abraham. they are both eventually caught and flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another "non-believing" nun in hastening a moslem invasion. flavia hangs out with the moslems who take over the convent and get "busy" with the nuns in a strange set of scenes. eventually the moslems roll-out and flavia is punished as a traitor to christianity in another singularly brutal scene...<br /><br />this one has pretty much all the stuff that i like to see in a 70's era exploit film - some good gore, including nipple-removal, and a nice leg-skinning scene, some decent nudity - including the requisite full-frontal, and a decent storyline as well. i will say that it sorta dragged in a few points, but not enough to get truly bored with it. i would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit/70's exploit fans...8/10
