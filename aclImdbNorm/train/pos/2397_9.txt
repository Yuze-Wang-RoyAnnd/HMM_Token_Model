having seen and loved greg lombardo's most recent film "knots" (he co-wrote and directed that feature as well), i decided to check out his earlier work, and this movie was well worth the effort and rental. macbeth in manhattan is a tongue in cheek, excellent take on the shakespeare favorite, updated and moved to nyc. i was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was wowed by the way the storyline of the production in the movie mirrors the storyline of the play itself - and very cleverly at that. the trials and tribulations of life in manhattan parallel many a shakespeare play, and central park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around macbeth's castle. mr. lombardo obviously has a fond place in his heart for new york and new york stories (knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirty-something new yorkers set primarily in a charming brooklyn neighborhood, with manhattan offices and a downtown loft thrown in for good measure) and has spent considerable time around the plays of shakespeare. the movie is well-paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of macbeth. it reminded me of al pacino's "looking for richard" - another wonderful shakespeare "play within a movie." i highly recommend checking out macbeth in manhattan.
