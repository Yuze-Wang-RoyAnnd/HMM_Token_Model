i've always believed that david and bathsheba was a film originally intended for tyrone power at 20th century fox, although gregory peck does give a good account of himself as king david, the monarch with a wandering eye.<br /><br />a whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and generally what god expects from his followers.<br /><br />when you're a king, even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot perogatives not open to the rest of us. king david has many wives, including one really vicious one in jayne meadows who was the daughter of saul, david's predecessor. but his eyes catch sight of bathsheba out in her garden one evening. turns out she's as unhappily married to uriah the hittite as david is to quite a few women. uriah is one of david's army captains. david sends for bathsheba and him being the king, she comes a runnin' because she's had her eye on him too.<br /><br />what happens, an affair, a pregnancy, and a carefully arranged death for uriah in a battle. but an all seeing and knowing deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing david and bathsheba, but the entire kingdom of israel is being punished with drought, disease, and pestilence.<br /><br />the sexist law of the day calls for bathsheba to have a stoning death. david shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him. he even lays hands on the ark of the covenant which was an instant death as seen in the film.<br /><br />my interpretation of it is that god admires guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on david and forgives them both. bathsheba becomes the mother of solomon and she and david are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of israel and judah until they're both conquered.<br /><br />susan hayward is a fetching bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with uriah played by kieron moore. the only thing that gets moore aroused is a good battle. i liked kieron moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear. <br /><br />no one can lay the law down like raymond massey. his nathan the prophet is in keeping with the john brown character he played in two films, same intensity. <br /><br />so when his own law called for death, why did god spare bathsheba and keep david on the throne. maybe it was the fact he just didn't want to train a third guy for the job. he'd replaced saul with david already. <br /><br />but i think the christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the new testament forthcoming, that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently. i'll leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations.<br /><br />watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory.
