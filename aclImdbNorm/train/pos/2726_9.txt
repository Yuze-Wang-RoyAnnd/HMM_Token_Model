this movie is up there with the all-time classics. the music, camera shots, and acting are excellent. showing the movie in black and white gave it a much better appearance and complemented the music perfectly, like psycho. its surprising how so few people have commented on this movie. my guess is that its a hard movie to find. i gave the film a 9. see the movie and you'll know what i'm talking about.
