far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's. george c. scott was born to be scrooge, just as he was born to be patton. mr. scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. the character of scrooge as played by mr. scott seemed to jump off the screen. scott as scrooge brought an richer, more robust, yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london. mr. scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal, understandable yet highly conflicted level; his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen: yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper, almost as a soliloquy, as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath, yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line. he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge, and a misunderstood, sympathetic scrooge all in the same scene.<br /><br />truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation.
