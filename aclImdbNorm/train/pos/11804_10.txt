rented the movie as a joke. my friends and i had so much fun laughing at it that i went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie i give them sasquatch hunters. it needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better. no talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are sasquatch repeated in a chant. i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well. "thanks for the jeep, tom!" whoever tom is i say thank you because without your jeep the movie may not have been made. in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. if you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy.
