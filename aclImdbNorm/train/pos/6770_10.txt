airwolf the movie, a variation on the original 2 part pilot, yet the movie although shorter, does contain extra footage unseen in the 2 hour pilot the pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie where as a pilot movie is normally the same (2 parter combined) but the movie is actually a different edit with extras here and cuts there.<br /><br />worth a look, even if you have the season 1 dvd set, i'd still pick up a copy of the "movie" it's still in some shops like virgin, woolworths and the likes of mixed media stores, although it generally needs ordering, but it saves needing to buy online (as many of us still don't do or trust online shopping) but if you look around airwolfs in stores<br /><br />airwolf was truly 1 of the 80's most under rated shows.<br /><br />a full size airwolf is currently being re-built for a helicopter museum :) info and work in progress pictures are over at http://airwolf.org also with airwolf mods for flashpoint and flight sim games it seams she's finally here to stay :)
