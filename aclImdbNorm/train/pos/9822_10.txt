i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me through the years. it's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, it's about the educational purpose, and the message behind that is the most important. it's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem. tons of girls i knew are all having children now, and i guess they never watched this great movie, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. it's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship. any girl can get pregnant the first time. it's not a myth. you don't necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.<br /><br />this movie has a clear message behind it: just say no!
