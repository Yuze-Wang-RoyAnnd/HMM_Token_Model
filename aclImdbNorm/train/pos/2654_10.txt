everyone should totally see this movie! it's freaking scary, but doesn't resort to lame "jump-out-at-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary" things. it really is great. see this freaking awesome movie!!! the director is stanley kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived. every single one of his movies are masterpieces, including this one. the shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the colorado rockies as caretakers for the winters, and get snowed in. well, the house is haunted. the kid is psychic. the husband is easily impacted by evil haunted hotels, and...well...hilarity ensues!!!! not really. it becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions, and it gets scary. not just the classic, "here's johnny" scene. it's memorable, but can't speak for the whole movies. it's one of those things where words don't explain it adequately, and you just gotta see it. so go on netflix, and get it! geeeeeetttttttt itttttttt!!!!!!!
