the main problem of the first "vampires" movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic. carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. the female vampire una certainly is the coolest vampire since blade's deacon frost. unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn't carpenter use more of this??) this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been. i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence (for example inside a city) and was left somewhat disappointed. while "los muertos" proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor, it still drags a little in some parts (though nowhere near as bad as "vampires" did). much like "vampires" however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense.<br /><br />most of the above may sound like "los muertos" is a bad movie but it definitely isn't. it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre. it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie out there) nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like blade ii. it simply could have used a bit more excitement.<br /><br />i'd really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but it's probably not going to happen.<br /><br />spoiler warning the ending was way too predictable. una should have gotten away- that would have made the movie quite unusual.
