the first time i came upon delirious, i only heard it. i listened to the entire comedic performance and never have i laughed so much in my life. eddie's ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is captivating. when i finally got to see him perform this act, i had to have it. eddie murphy's performance on delirious shows his genius! with it being the new millennium, his acts in 1983 is just as funny today as it was then. my parents loved it as teenagers and i (age eighteen) love it as well. from that point on, i had to view murphy's other movies such as coming to america and harlem nights. there will be no other comedian like eddie.
