for those who like their murder mysteries busy, this is definitely the one to see, as it is chock full of interesting and suspicious characters, most of them wealthy long island socialite types. as the star detective, william powell is alternately starchy and inspired, behaving at times as if he and his suit went to the cleaners and got pressed together. mary astor is very lovely here. <br /><br />powell had made a career out of playing the lead character, philo vance, in a series of movies made at a couple of studios over several years. in-between these films he developed into a somewhat offbeat romantic lead, at times even essaying gentleman gangster roles. already middle-aged, he was stuck in somewhat of a career rut by the time this one came along. as with so many early talkie stars, it seemed that his time had come and gone, that he was fine for early depression prohibition-era films, but that with changing times he was perhaps too mature and dandyish to endure.<br /><br />the kennel murder case, directed by the criminally neglected michael curtiz, is one of the last of the "old powells", while the next year would herald in the first of the new ones, the thin man, the success of which would catapult its leading players into the hollywood stratosphere. in kennel we can see the movies still in a somewhat stiff, ritualized pattern, as the camera does not move much, with the acting, like the presentation, tending toward the theatrical. there's no harm in this approach, though, which has its charms. it gives the movie a baroque quality.
