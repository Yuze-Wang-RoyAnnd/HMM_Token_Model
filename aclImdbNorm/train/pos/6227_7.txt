definitely one of the lesser of the astaire/rogers musicals. it's just very poorly plotted and paced. it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time, for example, but it feels a heck of a lot longer. this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard. scott is rarely ever interesting. i like hilliard. she's sweet, and i love at least one of her songs, "but where are you?" ("get thee behind me satan", her other number, is a weak leftover from top hat, thankfully cut from that masterpiece). follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers. the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers. the dance is just fantastic. "i'm putting all my eggs in one basket" presents the two rehearsing a dance that they don't quite have perfected yet. its imperfections make it all the more perfect. and "let's face the music and dance" is easily one of irving berlin's best songs. so the film is well worth watching for its great moments.
