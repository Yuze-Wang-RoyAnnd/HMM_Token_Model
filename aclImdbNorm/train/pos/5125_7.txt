i bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering texas day but was pleasantly surprised. after suffering through "saturday night foolishness" i had no desire to see a re-make in some south texas barnyard....and i didn't. john revolta was good as the jealous redneck, scott glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex-con, and debra winger was, as always, a delight. *love that woman* plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy that can't stand the sound of country music]. a fun film all the way.
