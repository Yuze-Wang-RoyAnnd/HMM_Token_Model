there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years. the gospel road was one of them. i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again. my favorite parts were the fact that <br /><br />1/jesus was blond, <br /><br />2/the last supper was a huge meal,<br /><br />3/ he liked playing with the children,<br /><br />4/his death was for all people and for all time.<br /><br />the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting, but it touched my heart at that time. besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture. if it ever comes out on dvd, i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons.
