this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw it.<br /><br />my mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in '92. i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairs.<br /><br />she was saying something like "don't let her get me" or something like that. i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she'd been watching the woman in black.<br /><br />so obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me. it scared the s*** out of me. i've been immune to horror films since watching this!
