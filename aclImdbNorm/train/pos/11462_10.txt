spoiler alert! this movie, zero day, gives an inside to the lives of two students, andre and calvin, who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and anything associated with there school.<br /><br />they go on a series of self-thought out "missions" all leading up to the huge mission, which is zero day. zero days contents are not specified until the middle to the end of the movie. the viewer knows its serious and filled with hate but is never quite sure until the end.<br /><br />now we all know, if the movie is based on the columbine massacre, the ending is pretty obvious. and the ending is no different than any other movie about the attack, they go and kill many of their fellow students in the end.<br /><br />i have seen a lot of movies on this attack, and this movie by far is my favorite, and most respected. it gives the viewer and inside look to the lives of these two teens who hate life, and honestly it gives the viewer some what of an understanding, and a closure on the horrible event.<br /><br />being only 7 when the events played out, i never knew the seriousness of the shootings, until my english class was assigned an essay or story on a defining moment in our generation. well i knew everyone was going to pick the twin towers, but i wanted to be different, because of course the twin towers was tragic and very defining, but i didn't think it was the right choice for me because there was really no way of relating to that because, i was only in the 3rd grade and i had no idea what it all meant. but the shootings did leave and effect. i remember the interviews, the sky views of the school, and the hurt and terror in the eyes of thousands of people.<br /><br />this movie is a compelling, down to earth, and horrific masterpiece, and i would reccomened it to anyone.
