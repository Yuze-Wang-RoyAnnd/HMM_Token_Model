this is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world. the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts, the only thing being shared is 9/11 as a theme (very minor in some cases). some of the segements are weak while others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some are solely about 9/11, some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch on human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic). this film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful.<br /><br />this is a very controversial film, especially for conservative americans. i think two segments might really tick off the right wingers (one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirits; another from uk which recounts the us-backed overthrow of chile on sept 11, 1973, which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrible atrocities). the segment from mexico was the most powerful, recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion (you have to see it to believe it).<br /><br />even though the final product is uneven, with some segments being almost "pointless", i still recommend this. it's very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place (some weak, some very powerful; ). i'm giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored (mexico segment, uk segment, japan segment, egypt segment).
