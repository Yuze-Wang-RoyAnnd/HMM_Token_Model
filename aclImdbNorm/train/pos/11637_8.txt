scream was wes craven's last decent thriller. since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night, including the disappointment of the scream sequels. perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him, so that when it came time for supper, he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo. finally, after who knows how many bad movies later, he gives us a delicious, ruthless, gripping, chilling suspense thriller with red eye.<br /><br />rachel mcadams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel. then she meets jackson ripner (cillian murphy, batman beyond) at the airport, who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze. what she doesn't know is he already knows her. and he also knows her father, who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet jackson's demands- to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination.<br /><br />you're probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes. although this is a good old fashioned thriller, that's the beauty of it. no special effects. no cheap make up. just classic suspense. you feel the desperation and regret with every decision mcadams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position.<br /><br />as always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance. it's either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry, but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it. cillian murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking, so even if the trailer didn't reveal it, his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass isn't so surprising. perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like toby maguire transforming into evil relentless madman. nevertheless, cillian murphy, after his true identity is established, played the role so solidly you'd really want him to die, or at least get his ass kicked.<br /><br />don't overlook this feature. there are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at craven's recent pictures. if not for the you, do it for all the times you'll see your girlfriend, or boyfriend, or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you. wes finally gets it right. aside from his trademark mastery in suspense, red eye is not without its humor as mcadams' replacement cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order. it was a relief that red eye wasn't a disappointment. instead you'll get the pleasure of seeing mcadams deliver another incredibly talented performance, murphy look creepier by the minute, and craven craft a classic traditional thriller. a flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of craven's renaissance had it arrived right after scream.
