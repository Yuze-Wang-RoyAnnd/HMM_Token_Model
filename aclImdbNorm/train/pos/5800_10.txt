this is by far my most favourite movie in the world!!!!! i enjoyed it when i was 4 and i still enjoy it at 16!! its an absolute masterpiece! no video collection is complete without it!!! i enjoy every second of it and not only does the film have some great special affects but its sends a great message to the youngsters of the audience which may sound sheesy but in actual fact the movie is done very cooly in actual fact! although michael jackson has been in afew movies now, people still dont see him as an actor. in reality he's the most talented actor i know! he's so talented! he's incredible!!! moonwalker is a must see!!!!!!
