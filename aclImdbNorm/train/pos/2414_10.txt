monarch cove was one of the best friday night's drama shown in a long time.i am asking the writer to please write a long series and air it on lifetime, soon.each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true. however, the movie needs to continue for a long time. i would love to see bianca and jake's child grow-up and get a major role in the movie, along with the new grandparents planning for her educational future. also, bring kathy back to see her niece and help foster her life.it was great seeing the grandparents work out their problems, but the family business needed to be restored to working status,and let us see how jake and bianca survive through the marriage years.
