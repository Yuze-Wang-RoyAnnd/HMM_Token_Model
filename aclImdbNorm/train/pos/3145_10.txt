that 70s show is the best tv show ever, period. it's up there with the andy griffen show, saturday night live, and the simpsons in my book. that 70s show continued on for 8 seasons, all of which focus around a group of teenagers/young adults dealing with relationships, separating from their parents, and their overall futures.<br /><br />the two main characters, eric and donna, are two teenagers living next door to each other. they have been living next door to each other for most of their lives, and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. a large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working.<br /><br />two other characters, red and kitty, are eric's parents. red was in the service, so he really pushes eric around. kitty is just the opposite. even though she drinks heavily, she treats eric and his friends with a lot of care. bob, their neighbor, is obviously donna's dad. bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show's story. bob also annoys red to his full extent.<br /><br />the remaining character, hyde, kelso, fez, and jackie, are eric's friends. they also play a major role in the show's story.<br /><br />well, the first season is great. this is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other. the first season is original, funny, and enjoyable.<br /><br />the second season is good, although it isn't as good as the first. it is a basic continuation of the first. eric and donna are together, and everything is working out great.<br /><br />the third season is my favorite. it went back and captured the first season feel and humor. i also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch, making the show all that more fun to watch.<br /><br />the fourth season isn't near as good. eric and donna arne't together in this one, making the show slightly less pleasurable. it is still funny, although i didn't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons.<br /><br />the fifth season is the last season i enjoyed all the way through. it is the gang's senior year, so that really helps with the story. the fifth season also had the best ending out of all the seasons.<br /><br />the sixth season is good for the most part. it is extremely funny, although it doesn't capture the feel that the other seasons did. the gang is out of high school, so i believe that it didn't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did. i also didn't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them.<br /><br />the seventh season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way, although it didn't do it all the way. i enjoyed the seventh season as i did all the others, and the ending is great.<br /><br />the last season flat out sucked. eric wasn't in it, which ruined it. kelso wasn't in it for the most part either, which didn't help. i hated the eighth season up until the last episode. i thought that the last episode was really good, and a fitting ending to the series.<br /><br />so overall, if you enjoy comedy, give that 70s show a try. they stopped making new episodes, but it is still on tv a bunch. i also recommend buying seasons 1-7. it is up to you if you want to buy season 8.
