this is a very exciting and romantic film. i have seen it several times and never get bored with it. everything is realistic and it is a good plot. the actors are excellent liam neeson, jessica lange, tim roth and brian cox.<br /><br />i actually prefer this film to braveheart as braveheart contain so many historical misstakes. there is many exciting scenes - watch out for the bridge scen and the last fencing scene. this is really good and surprising scenes.<br /><br />the music are lovely...it really suits to the movie. the setting is amazing.
