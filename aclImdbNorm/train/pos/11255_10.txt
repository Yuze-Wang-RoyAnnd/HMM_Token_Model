this is without doubt my favourite le carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for. i read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but i believe this misses the point. all le carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception. it is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set. betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody. pym upbringing is so close to my own that i find it chilling watching. peter egan is in his finest role and the late lamented ray mcanally is unbelievably good. even the smallest roles played by such as andy de la tour, tim healy and jack ellis are spot on. this cast is a theatre impresario's dream. the story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason. all my sympathies lie with magnus pym and his sole (non sexual) love for poppy (r"udiger weigang-as wonderful as always. his only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals. outstanding! rent it, buy it. love it.
