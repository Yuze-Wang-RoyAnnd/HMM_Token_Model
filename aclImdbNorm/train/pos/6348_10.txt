jim carrey is good as usual, and even though there are quite a few "jim carrey moments", it's definitely not a "jim carrey movie".<br /><br />it's targeted mostly at children, and i managed to enjoy it as such movie. it was promoted in israel as another jim carrey movie, so those who expected a weird over the top comedy were disappointed.<br /><br />the movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids. i can't say i loved this movie, but then again i'm not its target audience!
