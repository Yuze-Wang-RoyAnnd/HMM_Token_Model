ok - i admit. i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable, but reasonable plot.<br /><br />starting out, we're introduced to the three lead females of the movie. one a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never married. a police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about. the third - a power & status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's.<br /><br />they are almost the "first wives club", and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex's involved as well as some "he left the credit card" behaviour. characters set - the movie continues.<br /><br />mcdowell's character, the headmistress, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist, filling in for the regular player (doughty) catches her eye. what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief? will they live happily ever after?<br /><br />a tissue or two recommended if you're the teary type - the end uplifting, but maybe not what you'd expect. all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action, special effects and schlock horror.
