the five deadly venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery. there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung-fu flick: great choreography, awful dubbing, different "styles" of fighting, and a wide range of greatly exaggerated, often cheesey human emotions. however the plot certainly is better than average. it's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non-fight scenes. occasionally it's even able to fire up the audience, such as when x character receives horrible injustice.<br /><br />another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie's morals and themes. just about everyone gets what's coming to them. the cowardly, greedy, and corrupt lose out. the bad guys, consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing. the good guys use teamwork, planning, and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top. <br /><br />poison clan rocks!
