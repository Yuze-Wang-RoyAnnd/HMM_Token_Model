the ladies man is laugh out loud funny, with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written).<br /><br />ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role.<br /><br />tim meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there.<br /><br />it is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round.<br /><br />i am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre 4.7 /10 and i urge you to vote! <br /><br />and remember kids- "theres more motion in the ocean"
