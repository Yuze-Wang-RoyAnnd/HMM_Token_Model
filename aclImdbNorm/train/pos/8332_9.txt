the part where meg visits the mechanic and he says - "is the piston firing short?" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fianc'ee) was hilarious. i love meg ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. very lovable and very intelligent too. her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours. the hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well. einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well. it's awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival. it loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the us govt. i don't see why it doesn't figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. great movie, it has the presidential seal of approval on it!
