i was probably one of the few australians not watching the tennis when this series aired. i have to say when william mcinnes first appeared i though, that is one crappy actor! but as the series continued he toned down his performance and i totally loved him. he was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh. i watched the show to see hugo speers (heart and bones, the full monty) and tom long (seachange, two hands). it was interesting to see speers play a nice, quiet man and even more interesting to watch tom longs' rippling muscles! sigh... seriously, long's performance was a total shock and really brilliant. he stole the show. martin sacks was good also in a small role, and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance. i'd recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching tom long walk around with no shirt on...
