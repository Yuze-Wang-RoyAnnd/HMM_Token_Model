i found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh, so i have decided to write my own. i first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then. first of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets right are what make it worthwhile. it doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults. it is worth watching. the idea of basing a movie on walt whitman's visit a restrictive, narrow-minded anglo-canadian community in southern ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. the movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis whitman inspired in people. and in that sense it is exactly accurate. the acting - especially by rip torn (whitman) and colm feore as the doctor - is very good. the scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. overall, what's not to like? besides, name another film in which whitman is brought so vividly to life?
