***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** after two so-so outings ("magnum force" and "the enforcer"), dirty harry seems to have regained his stride in "sudden impact," a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths: the charisma of clint eastwood, who also directed, and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes.<br /><br />for once, the case takes harry outside his native san francisco (where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his "shoot first, ask questions later" tactics), to the hamlet of san paulo. there, (warning: potential spoiler) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered, one at a time, by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier, and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack.<br /><br />the killer is portrayed by sondra locke, and she makes the character of jennifer spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness. locke's cold eyes and frosty voice, when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists, are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit.<br /><br />the rapists are a despicable lot, especially the leader, who has "psycho nutjob" practically stamped on his forehead, and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys, despite her anatomical inability to participate. the flashback scenes, while not graphically explicit, are nightmarish enough, and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for jennifer as she kills her assailants.<br /><br />some will dismiss "sudden impact" as trash: a mindless, manipulative revenge tale. on a certain level this is true, but it's well-done trash. what works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the sondra locke performance, giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. what we have here is an action movie with a point of view.<br /><br />you can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to harry (a realization that, wisely, is not spelled out with dialogue), he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate. this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare.<br /><br />the movie's other redeeming quality is eastwood's direction. this is, after all, a dirty harry movie, and eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. the movie is directed with style and wit, and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff. some of the best "harry moments" in the entire series are here, including harry's best-known line, "go ahead -- make my day."<br /><br />"sudden impact" is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. it is also a riveting detective story, well made and well told. and it is certainly never dull. on those criteria, it succeeds tremendously.
