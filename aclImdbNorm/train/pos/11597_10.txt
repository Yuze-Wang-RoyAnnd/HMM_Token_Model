i read so many comments that i, too, shared about remembering this movie and wanting so badly to see it again but i didn't know the name of the movie. thankfully, because of doing a search and finding the title on this site, i read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie i remembered. i then did a search and did find the movie and was so thrilled to be able to watch the movie once more 40 years later. because of this site and your comments, you helped me and so i want to thank all of you. i want to share how i was able to find this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy as well. it was on the vhs version of wonderful world of disney's "call it courage" which contained 2 movies, the second one being "the legend of the boy and the eagle." it touched me now as much as it did 40 years ago and now i own my own copy of it. i think it is only available on vhs. i found it on ebay and i have seen several copies of it there. enjoy it, i know i did!<br /><br />it is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he took care of. when it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy set the eagle free because he couldn't allow it to be killed. after the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after freeing the eagle, the eagle, too, saved the boy's life and more than that, taught him how to survive. the closeness that the boy and the eagle shared in the wilderness was so moving and the filming was really remarkable. what a wonderful era this was. i have never seen anything come even close to this movie!
