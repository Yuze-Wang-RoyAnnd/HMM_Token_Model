jack frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death. on the way to his death sentence the prison truck that he rides in collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that turns his molecules with the snow on the ground turning him into a snowman. being a killer himself that would turn him into a killer snowman. jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him. jack now starts his rampage all over again killing people in a small town.<br /><br />i don't think jack frost has a chance of becoming a horror classic but its a entertaining flick. just put your brain on hold and have fun with it, but just don't take it too seriously.
