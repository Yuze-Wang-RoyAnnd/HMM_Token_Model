this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great. maybe this is because gorris' takes nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokov's one.<br /><br />the only thing in the movie which i don't like is the influence of valentinov's on luzhin's destiny. i can't imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novel's argument.
