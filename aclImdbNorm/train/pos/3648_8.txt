"pandora's clock" is a gripping suspense/thriller that's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film. this movie, which aired in two parts on nbc in its debut showing in 1996, is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease. the u.s. government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (richard dean anderson) and a virus expert (daphne zuniga) try to figure something out to avoid disaster. i'm not really a big fan of tv movies and miniseries, but i liked "pandora's clock". it's one heck of a thrill ride. jane leeves (tv's "frasier"), robert loggia, and edward herrmann (as the president) also star.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
