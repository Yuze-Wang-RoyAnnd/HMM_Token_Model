written by oliver stone and directed by brian de palma, scarface paints a picture not easily forgotten. al pacino turns in a stunning performance as tony montana, a cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in florida. this gangster flick is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word "f--k" the most number of times. almost three hours long, and yes it can get repulsive. a stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord.<br /><br />also playing interesting characters are michelle pfeiffer, steven bauer, robert loggia, mary elizabeth mastrantonio, f. murray abraham and angel salazar. pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. he manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression. this will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster. is that powerful enough for you? crime does not pay for long!
