i truly enjoyed the movie, however, i did not realize that little richard had so many things going on in his life. first of all i was not aware of lucille. there is very little (hardly any) mention of females being intimately involved with little richard. even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way. i wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. overall the movie was great. i also did not like leon playing the part of little richard, he is a good actor but i feel that the part of should have went to a different actor. visually he did not remind me of little richard. i also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that little richard was a part of. from the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict. in todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition. he was a voyeur. i don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that i feel should not have been a part of the final cut.
