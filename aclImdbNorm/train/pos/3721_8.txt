this was one of the best war movies i've seen because it focuses on the characters more then the actual war. all of the cast do an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more believable. the camera footage is great is so was the pacing and editing. this movie will actually get to you and causes the audience to care for the charcters.
