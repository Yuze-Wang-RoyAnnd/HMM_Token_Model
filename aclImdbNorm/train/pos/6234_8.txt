this is my all-time favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film. the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever. not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; like i'm putting all my eggs in one basket and let's face the music and dance. if i remember correctly, this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so i suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental cr*p but i'm woman so get over it)all in all this film gets an 8/10 from me. the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome.
