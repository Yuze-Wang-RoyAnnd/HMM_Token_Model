in the fifties the age restrictions for films in brazil were the following: no restriction, 10 years old, 14 years old and 18 years old. usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old, when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14, but it was rare to see a western restricted for younger than 18. winchester 73 was one of those, and i think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average. the hero, james stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father. he was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the average good guy. anthony mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with stewart. shelley winters, the leading lady was far from virtuous, she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle. dan duryea as waco johnnie dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered. the story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with the rifle, is one of the best suited for a western. it was to be made into a fritz lang film, which did not come through. when it was offered to mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for lang. with winchester, mann created a different conception of western, but still maintaining all its traditions. winchester still is a great film to see again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released.
