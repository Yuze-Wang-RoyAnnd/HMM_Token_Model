i loved this mini series. tara fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying helen graham, a beautiful young woman hiding, along with her young son, from a mysterious past. as an anglophile who loves romances... this movie was just my cup of tea and i would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the england of the 1800's. i also must mention that toby stephens who portrays the very magnetic gilbert markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production.
