being that i am not a fan of snoop dogg, as an actor, that made me even more anxious to check out this flick. i remember he was interviewed on "jay leno," and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget adam sandler comedy "the longest yard" to be in this film. so obviously, snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops. i'm not going to overpraise snoop for his performance in "the tenants." there are certainly better rapper/actors, like mos def, who could've done more with his role. but the point is snoop did a "good" job. he can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections, but that's something even jack nicholson has a problem doing. the point is i found him convincing in the role, and the tension between him and dylan mcdermott's character captivating. mcdermott, by the way, gives the best performance in the film, though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by snoop's not-so-subtle acting. being a big reader and aspiring writer myself, i couldn't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating. it did aggravate me how snoop's character would constantly ask mcdermott to read his work, and berate him for criticizing it. but you know what? i'm sure a lot of writers are like that. his character was supposed to be flawed, as was mcdermott's, in his own way. my only mild criticism of the film would be its ending. for some reason, it just felt too rushed for me, though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, rather than plot.
