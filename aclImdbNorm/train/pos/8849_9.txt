the hanson brothers - andy (apparently has his act together) and hank (clearly doesn't have his act together) need money. andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole hanson family.<br /><br />this film delivers. this is a layered, full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing. as a crime drama / thriller i would happily compare it to 'no country for old men.' while both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills, 'devil' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace. 'no country' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire, while 'devil' is a bit more enjoyable. there is definitely less violence in 'devil' than 'no country.' the acting delivers as well. ethan hawke, sometimes wooden in the past, brings the jitters, sweating and the deer-in-the-headlights-look to the besieged hank. philip seymour hoffman, as andy, has the film's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor, who you believe can do anything.<br /><br />there's really not much wrong with this film. it jumps back and forth without being confusing. events spiral out of control, but the film never does - the writing (from first timer kelly masterson), directing (veteran sidney lumet) and the editing stay as tight as a drum. in many categories, this is award caliber stuff, though maybe films like 'the departed' and 'no country' squeezed this one out of the limelight. if you liked those, you'll like this.
