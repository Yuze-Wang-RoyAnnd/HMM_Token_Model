principally it is the story of two men who were part of the portuguese revolution. it was easy to understand the contest, but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else, or they shows also the period before or after this fact, here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts. it could also be seen as a kind of documentary. the movie focalize to these two people, showing as normal they were, not like common heroes, because the revolution come from people. although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just "capitaes" as the main characters. nice colors and lights during the whole movie, excellent work for the director being her first movie, she doesn't fall to the banal way. well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd. the character of maia (main one)is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for stefano accorsi, able to show maia's limits, this not-being an hero.
