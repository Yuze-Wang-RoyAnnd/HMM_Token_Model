we fans of ed wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place, but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan-dom that i have never before approached! one of the most intense thrills of non-mainstream movie adulation - at least as far as i am concerned - is the pleasure of unearthing the obscure. i remember how, as a teenager, i longed to see eddie's "revenge of the dead" (a.k.a. "night of the ghouls"), which at that time had been vaulted for a couple of decades. likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as doris wishman's "a night to dismember" or half the works of jesus franco! however, recent years have seen video and dvd rendering these once unfindable treasures almost too accessible - even for those of us on the 'wrong' (!) side of the atlantic....<br /><br />and then, behold, there was "i woke up early the day i died" - a movie that should have been so 'big', yet which disappeared into the ether even before fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite. the 1990s needed a hard-to-find movie though which would really be worth hunting out: and this, to be sure is it.... i don't especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film - its classy-yet-kitsch cast, its haunting yet often hallucinogenic visuals, its wondrous moments of "pure cinema" (in the sense of the 1920s french cineastes) and surrealism, or even its resoundingly memorable soundtrack - since this has all been described most eloquently by other users here.<br /><br />what i do wish to mention, briefly, is the pleasure that i have received also from hunting down certain obscure artefacts relating to this almost-lost-to-us-but-thankfully-not-quite movie! i think the german video, which i picked up while in cologne on a cold crisp winter's day, is fairly well-known to ed wood's followers now. it is also quite common knowledge that a promotional poster for the film was released. however, there is thankfully more to be found!!! firstly, there are a number of reviews available from the film's german theatrical release - i have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to "woodify" my students..... some of these reviews are positive eulogies to the film's artistry and entertainment value - and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it squarely within both the american trash and european arthouse traditions. secondly, there is the score by larry groupe', which can be acquired from the man himself - many of the tracks exert a truly emotional pull on the listener, particularly if you are contemplating the film's currently "vaulted" status and growing a little melancholy at the same time. finally - for now - i wish to mention the promo soundtrack that cinequanon put out in extremely limited numbers. beg, borrow, steal, kill or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these!!!!!! it features 14 tracks from the film, including eartha kitt's ballad, the late darcy clay's "jesus i was evil" (two versions of which are also available on cd from new zealand, although that is another story again!), the cool radio music to which christina ricci dances, and also those amazing techno drops by minty and zhv (the latter being billy z's very own techno band).....<br /><br />become obsessed - let ed wood rule your life.
