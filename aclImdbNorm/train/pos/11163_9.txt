i love this freekin movie! walsh is a true master of the cinematic form, his film have been sometimes in my opinion, overlooked. but this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in.\<br /><br />all the wonderful characters that existed, the lifestyle, the mode of dress, the way they spoke, ok they might be exaggerated, but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts.<br /><br />i just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact.<br /><br />can i get it somewhere on dvd? i have only seen it on tv. but for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one.
