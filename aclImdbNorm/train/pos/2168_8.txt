i saw this movie on tv late one night years ago, but it was a disturbing experience that has stayed with me to this day.<br /><br />the premise may seem a bit unoriginal - due to an earthquake, a hidden underground store of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town is breached, and a microscopic amount of the substance finds its way into their food supply. the inhabitants of the town begin to lose their ability to exercise restraint over every whim and base desire that floats through all of our minds from time to time, and that normally we know we simply must not act upon.<br /><br />the pace of the movie is slow, but for me that only added to the creeping unease as the townspeople's behaviour slowly starts to unravel. there are several surreal and very unsettling scenes that have remained etched in my memory all this time.<br /><br />it raises interesting questions about what we could all be capable of if we gave in to our most feral instincts. did i enjoy it? i'm not sure 'enjoy' is the right word. did it make me think? definitely. i'm still thinking about it. scary stuff.
