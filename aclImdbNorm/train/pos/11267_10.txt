robert wuhl is teaching a class of film students at new york university in manhattan, new york.<br /><br />he covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known. i would like to see much more of this show. it is very entertaining. mr. wuhl uses examples and "show and tell" to get his points across. he explained that the person who actually rode the midnight ride of paul revere was not paul revere! henry wadsworth longfellow used revere's name because it sounded better.<br /><br />i've watched robert wuhl for many years, from the time he was doing stand-up comedy and all the way through "arli$$" on hbo. he's a good actor and a good stand-up comedian, but he's an excellent teacher! i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show. it is well worth your time.
