i just watched holly along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called trade at film by the sea international film festival. i have to say that holly blew trade out of the water. <br /><br />holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels. from purely an artistic and cinematic perspective, it is amazing. the sound-mixing, camera angles, directing and acting are all spot on. <br /><br />additionally, the way it handles the subject matter is tasteful and non-exploitative. it presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate. the filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to detail, truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking. too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape, and violence. holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into that typical hollywood trend. <br /><br />i've had the pleasure of seeing holly at two separate film festivals, once in the us and once in netherlands. i can honestly say that i have never seen audiences more moved. just listening to conversations after the screening, people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation. <br /><br />i highly recommend it to everyone, both for its cinematic value and its subject matter.
