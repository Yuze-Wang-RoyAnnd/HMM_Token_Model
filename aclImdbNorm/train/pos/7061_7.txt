of course, the original is better, but this isn't as bad as everyone says! yes, it is made up into 3 stories, but hey, so what?! i thought it was quite good to be honest. i actually liked how anastasia changed a little when she fell in love, it shows what love can do. the stories were not so bad either.<br /><br />i liked cinderella's voice better in this too. i have nothing against her voice in the original, but i just think it sounds better here, more nicer. i liked her personality in this too, she had more of a backbone, yet she was still kind.<br /><br />so, i'll give cinderella ii:dreams come true a 7/10.
