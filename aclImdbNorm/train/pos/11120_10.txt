wow. i loved the whole series, and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly. perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 & 5, while remaining better than anything else on television. but 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons. <br /><br />6b started with such a sombre mood and janice's always keen insight into the family angst - that doom-filled line about knowing tony's penchant for sitting and staring. anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know tony. melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath's self-deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series, say, with tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with phil's "wave bye-bye" line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode (not to get into chase's dark humour).<br /><br />i could go on and on, but i'll just add that i thought the final show - starting with the opening strains of vanilla fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow ("you keep me hangin' on") to the terminal moments where tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like aj's suv or phil's head were, utterly, utterly perfect. the best tv ever. <br /><br />pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the "jack-off fantasies" aj derides (and then into which he promptly subsides). a tip of the pork pie to mr. chase.
