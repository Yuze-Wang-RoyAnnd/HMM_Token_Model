of course the plot, script, and, especially casting are strong in the film. so many fine things to see. one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonist--luzhini's (turturro's)--ex-mentor working his evil on the sidelines. his chess opponent--an italian dandy in three piece and cane--turns out to be a real gent, and a truly fine chess player. to his credit the "opponent" nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously (luzhin has taken a flyer out a window--sad, but so releasing to him)by way of the unstable genius' widow (emily watson.) in death, then, because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master, luzhin's defence (which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity) is allowed to be played. the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant. talk about a dramatic "end game!"
