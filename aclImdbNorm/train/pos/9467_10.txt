i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a dramedy that was well written-thank you peter hedges-and because when steve carell stars in the film, you know an audience is going to find like in little miss sunshine, a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding. dan in real life delivered that promise.<br /><br />the film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss. with steve carell and the wondrous juliette binoche, their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their journeys. the cast, sets and story made dan in real life one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead.
