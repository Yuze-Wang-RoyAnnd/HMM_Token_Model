i had no problem with the film, which i thought was pretty good. it's the actual lapd crime scene video that disturbed me. i wonder if lion's gate really thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place. sorry lion's gate, this was an incredibly bad idea!!!<br /><br />getting back to the film: the cast was excellent, especially val kilmer as the late john holmes. john holmes was a sleaze ,mistreats the women in his life (lisa kudrow as his wife, kate bosworth as his girlfriend),and he is hopelessly deep into drugs. his connection to eddie nash (eric bogosian)creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous wonderland murders. exactly how much was holmes involved in the murders? we may never know the entire truth to the story(nash is still alive and a free man),but the film does a pretty good job nonetheless.
