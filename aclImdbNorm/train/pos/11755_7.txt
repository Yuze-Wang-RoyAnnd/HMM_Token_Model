i love this movie, but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid.<br /><br />the fateful game took place in 1972. that means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. but almost all of the music played at the dances etc. is from the 1950s and very early 1960s.<br /><br />having just attended my 30th high school reunion, i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music.<br /><br />i understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically. but it wasn't completely bereft, and the producers of the film should have taken more care. i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film.<br /><br />this was a bad director and/or producer decision.
