i was very impressed with this film. i would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns. i say that for the whole thing: the acting, mature dialog, no- nonsense story and excellent cinematography.<br /><br />director anthony mann, who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era, also made some westerns such as this one. it has that same film-noir look. mann and jimmy stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . if you like this movie, i recommend the mann-stewart film "bend of the river."<br /><br />in a nutshell, the story is about a man, "lin mcadam," (stewart) who owns this prestigious winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won fair-and-square in a contest. it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain. all of those villains are interesting characters.<br /><br />aiding stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters, dan duryea, stephen mcnally, millard mitchell, charles drake, will greer and j. c. flippen. all of them are fun to watch. it was a bit of a stretch, however, to see rock hudson playing an indian ("young bull"), but you can't have everything.
