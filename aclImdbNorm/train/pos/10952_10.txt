sarah silverman is a dangerous bitch! she's beautiful, sexy, funny and talent, dark and demonic. i read the other 'comment' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don't get it. nothing that appears on t.v. is an accident. too much money, time and work is put into the production of a t.v. show for there to be mistakes. this show is stupid because sarah wanted it to be stupid. this show is juvenile because sarah wanted it to be juvenile. i thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre. it's a lot like pee-wee's playhouse for maladjusted, slacker twenty-something glue sniffing, future pornstars of america from the valley. the cast is awesome. the scenarios and action is well-paced. i hope this show succeeds since comedy central didn't let david spade keep his show. who plays sarah's sister? she not in the cast listing on the show's home page. i would love to see her stand-up. does anyone know about her up-coming show dates or dvds that may be floating around out there?
