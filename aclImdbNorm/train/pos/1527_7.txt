savaged when it came out, this film now looks handsome and sounds great. a feast of intelligent thoughtful acting, from gielgud, kenneth haigh, harry andrews and especially anton walbrook,and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young jean seberg. preminger doesn't jump around and show off- his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect, and graham greene's script condenses shaw without sacrificing complexity.the piece has the look of a made for tv movie, and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that. too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist dumbing down. what would mel gibson have made of the maid? many drooling shots of her on the rack probably, then crisping up on the bbq as the flames take hold. preminger does none of this. the burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken reaction. there are a few weak performances, but not enough to cause any serious damage. i caught this movie on tv and was not expecting to watch it through, but i was gripped . in our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, joan's story has unexpected resonance.
