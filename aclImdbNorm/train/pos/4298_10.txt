this movie awed me so much that i watch it at least once a year. at times i find it uncomfortable. at times i find it empowering. and i always find the characters human and real. it is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in la, starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters. it is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference. grand canyon reminds you that every action you take, whether intended or not, has powerful repercussions. i found this movie to be similar in many ways to robert altman's film short cuts. both had a star-studded roster of perfectly cast actors & actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other, for better or worse. grand canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message, (hope in the face of despairing reality), than altman's film, although i found them both intriguing in their own way. this film is a definite must see!!!
