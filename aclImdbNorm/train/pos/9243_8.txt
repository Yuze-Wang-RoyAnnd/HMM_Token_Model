don't listen to the many acerbic and derisory comments heaped upon this film.....simply put, as regards ninja movies, this my friends is about as good as it gets! <br /><br />yes it's silly, yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious, but by gum - it's so much bloody fun! in fact, as is often the case with b-movies, the horrendous 'acting' (which in the case of the movie in question, is truly amongst the worst i have ever had the joy to behold!) and ridiculous 'plot' actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten fold.<br /><br />obviously the fight scenes are the main attraction in this though and for the most part i'm pleased to say, they're very well choreographed, especially the final showdown (during which we witness that ninja are not ostensibly constrained by the normal laws of gravity....) <br /><br />trust me on this, if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen sakura killers, then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion, one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre.
