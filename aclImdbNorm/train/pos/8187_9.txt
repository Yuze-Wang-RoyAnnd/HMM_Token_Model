anyone find it interesting that the ood look strangely similar to the 'great cthulhu' of h p lovecraft vintage? hmmm? <br /><br />great pair of episodes (not referring to billie piper as most seem to do!) in the impossible planet and the satan pit.<br /><br />also the link to 'legion' i think also used in who before and also referring to satan in various novels post exorcist era...<br /><br />great suspense episodes utilising fear and faith elements. the new team for these 'who's are working great magic for tv.<br /><br />this certainly creates new fears and 'hide behind the sofa' feelings not seen for many, many years in this continuation of a superb bbc series (pity it is confirmed by the bbc that billie piper is quitting - perhaps not permanently - after end of series 2) :o(((
