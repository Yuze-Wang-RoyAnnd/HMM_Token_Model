when the matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration. that didn't really happen, surprisingly, and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear. but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discredit.<br /><br />the story is of a morgan sullivan, who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called digicorp. his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company, while under an assumed and false identity. his home-life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he's actually doing. however, things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what's going on, he starts to question who he actually is. this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up...<br /><br />twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated, and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable.<br /><br />it's an enthralling journey through a not-too-distant future, and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />highly recommended.
