a beautiful movie, especially if you like horses,wwii films and the austere hungarian plateau.a story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters' horse in his own training.<br /><br />i will buy this movie and watch it again. this is a family film and i recommend it highly.a good ''family nite'' movie. although there are some violent scenes, it was the nazi occupation of hungary.the native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down brady.a hauntingly beautiful film.
