i really truly enjoyed this movie. (which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site!) i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy saturday night. it is funny, poignant, and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others! (fess up ladies, we have all been there!) bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it. (and truly, there is the best "wedding escape" that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film ... more guts than anyone i have ever known!) you will laugh and you will cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing .... it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office. (now i have to look around to purchase a copy!)
