i saw this film when i was a young child on television (thank-you canadian broadcasting corporation) and had nightmares about it for years afterwards.<br /><br />trnka was one of the mentors for bratislav pojar, one of canada's national film board's best animators. pojar was, in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great drouin. if you like trnka you should see "night angel".<br /><br />the symbolism is obvious, but deftly used. the oppositions of beauty and life (the plant) are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand. the poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda.<br /><br />what i most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor. the small room where the action takes place is the character's entire world. the invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world.<br /><br />beautiful and haunting film. i found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids. a must see.
