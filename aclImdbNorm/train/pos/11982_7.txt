this is how i feel about the show.<br /><br />i started watching the show in reruns in 2001.<br /><br />i enjoy the show but it had too many faults.<br /><br />i hate the michelle & joey characters!<br /><br />stealing story lines from old tv shows. they even stole from "the partirdge family." then in 1 episode "the partridge family" was mentioned.<br /><br />actors playing different roles in different episodes. mtv martha quinn the most notable doing this, especially when she played herself in 1 episode.<br /><br />the michelle character could not take a joke but then they had this little kid act out "revenge" to her sisters for a joke by them on her.<br /><br />story lines that came & went in 1 episode. joey getting the tv show with frankie & annette, never heard from it again after that. danny all of a sudden playing the guitar. 1 episode he is coaching soccer, 1 episode he is coaching softball/baseball. 1 game & you are out huh danny? <br /><br />jesse & joey keep getting jobs really quickly with no experience. only in a tv show.<br /><br />i did like the d.j. & stephanie characters. wish jodie sweetin could have learned from candace cameron bure & had a clean non drug adult life.
