on mtv cribs all the ballers and shot callers pull the classic movie scarface out of their dvd collection. this may give you an idea that scarface is a "gangster movie". sure, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but that's not the point of scarface. tony montana (al pacino) is just a cuban refuge looking for a new way of life. he falls in with the mob group and becomes a well-known drug lord. montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life. the classic phrase: "say hello to my little friend!" is in scarface. this quote is what always comes to mind when i think about brian depalmas movie, scarface. this falls under my top 10 favorite movies. i would rate it ***1/2 (out of ****). definitely a movie you must see. phenomenal.
