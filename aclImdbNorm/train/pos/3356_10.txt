ettore scola is one of the most important italian directors. my parents and i watched together "c'eravamo tanto amati" on a summer night: we liked it, but we didn't love it as we loved "a special day". i believe ettore scola is pretty underrated: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films were disappointing. and so, yesterday night, my mum and i sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. writing, direction, cinematography, score and production design were sober and accurate, but the thing i liked the most was the chemistry between loren and mastroianni. they're both excellent actors and play the main roles of antonietta and gabriele. antonietta is an housewife: married with a fanatic fascist, she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families. gabriele is simply an anti-fascist. they spend together a special day, that special day of 1938 when hitler came to rome visiting mussolini. i don't want to spoil anymore about the plot: go looking for this film!
