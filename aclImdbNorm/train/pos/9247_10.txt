i expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance. boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. it wasn't like that at all. clark gable plays con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising. he is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into ruby (jean harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. instant chemistry.she plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. the heat between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a boarding house for "troubled girls", she is miserable and, thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her, begins to believe that eddie will never come for her. harlow plays the hard-nosed, fast talking ruby perfectly. she never lets gable get all the good lines! there is an especially moving scene with her playing "their song" on the piano that is acted perfectly. the last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. a truly sweet romance.
