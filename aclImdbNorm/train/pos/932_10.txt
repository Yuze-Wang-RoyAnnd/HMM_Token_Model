*********ten out of ten stars********* <br /><br />it's hard to believe this was a made for television movie. just the phrase, "made of tv", makes me shudder. the production values for made for tv movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios. that being said, this version of the "christmas carol" should have been released in theaters, because it is that good. it's my personal favorite of all the "christmas carol" movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality. yes, there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge, but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a couple of mistakes.<br /><br />scott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge, he's a pleasure to watch. in fact, i can't think of one performance in this film that shouldn't be applauded. the costuming, location shooting, and winter backdrop are mesmerizing. the musical score is endearing and heart warming. add to that, solid directing, flawless cinematography, and faithful scripting; we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic. it really hasn't been around long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day soon it will be. this film has turned into a yearly christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind christmas: love, selflessness, and giving. in as selfish, greedy world, my family and i can lose ourselves in "the christmas carol", starring george c. scott.
