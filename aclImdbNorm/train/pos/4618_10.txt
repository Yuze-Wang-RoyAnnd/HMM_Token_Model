i really enjoyed this movie.i was fifteen when this movie came out and i could relate. this will be a movie i would show my kids to let them know, the feelings they are having are normal. it is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young age..who knew that we would bounce back....again and again....great movie!!!!
