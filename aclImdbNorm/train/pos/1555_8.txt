after watching the rather sloppy ww1 spy thriller, madam lili (1969)starring julie andrews on tv this afternoon, i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior ww1 spy thriller. all i could remember was that it was produced by dino de laurentis. it only took a short search on imdb to find fraulein doktor. once i recognised the title the memories came flooding back. it is, for its time, a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of kitchener and the german offensives of 1918.it also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews! as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks. if you have an interest in war films and particularly ww1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity.
