i sincerely hope that at least the first season of cosby is released on dvd someday. the episode with hilton's eccentric genius brother, george (played by the late roscoe lee browne), is classic hilarity. it reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy.<br /><br />mr. cosby and ms. rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on the cosby show for many years and to put them in a more middle-class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists. <br /><br />the roster of comedic dynamite...madeline kahn, phylicia rashad, and mr. cosby ...classic genius!
