the premise is simple. this movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport, then things take a 180 degree turn...<br /><br />i for one, really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater. and it is my humble opinion that wes craven, based on his previous meta-horror films (sceam) does too...<br /><br />following this logic, it's not surprising to find that craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet 'sependipity love'-story, only to have an awesome cillian murphy wreck that whole sugar-coated dreamworld... <br /><br />the scope of his character jackson ripner (jack the ripper, get it? lame, right?) in this film is impressive, he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko, which is a plus in my book. as he proceeds to freak out his victim (jennifer garner lookalike rachel mcadams, who i found pretty annoying by the way), you can't help but sympathize with the guy...<br /><br />this is wes craven, embodied in jackson ripner, through cillian murphy, bashing all brainless chick flicks...<br /><br />mr. craven, i salute you.<br /><br />best quote:<br /><br />jackson ripner (after beating the snot out of rachel mcadams in the airplane toilet): "thanks for the quickie!!!"
