this film is absolutely stunning. a new blade runner - future noir at it's most gritty. the vision of paris is superb, both recognisable and visionary, with sweeping vistas, grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality.<br /><br />the story line is quite simple, with few surprises, but that's not what i like most about the film. it is a visual treat. <br /><br />done in 3d and rendered in black and white (no greys!) with only one short spot of colour, it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds. there are many "arty" camera shots - closeups and odd viewpoints - but that just adds to the temperament of the film. overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form.<br /><br />i was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped, such was the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions. but unlike "a scanner darkly" - which suffers from (or indeed is enhanced by) inconsistent character definition (just watch the way some of the hair changes shape!) - renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. when the character is in close-up, added details and texture can bee seen, but when in mid-shot or further away details are omitted, but not to the detriment of character definition.<br /><br />for me, the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one-off project. such a shame, as i would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir storyline and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style.<br /><br />oh, and the english dub is great too.<br /><br />all in all a great film and highly recommended.
