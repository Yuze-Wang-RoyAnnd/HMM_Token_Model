this is one of the best movies. it is one of my favorites. a movie with good acting. the story is very sensitive and touching. good camera work also.<br /><br />the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list. however, they give equal or better performances than the top of the list.<br /><br />it is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love, romance, friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick-box their way to save the world.<br /><br />if you don't like this movie then you have no heart or feelings. then go watch a sports movie. there is no killing or horror here. see the movie. it is a must. th
