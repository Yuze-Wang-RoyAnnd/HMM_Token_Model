i often wonder why this series was slammed so much. i thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed. i think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves, that is if they ever issue it. many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all went on to greater things. maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued. sally phillips, simon pegg, peter serafinowicz and not least julian rhind-tutt of the hugely successful green wing. the writers graham linehan and arthur matthews are two of the finest comedy writers of the modern age. anyone that can produce comedy like father ted couldn't be capable of writing something not worthy of publication. if it is ever issued i will certainly buy it.
