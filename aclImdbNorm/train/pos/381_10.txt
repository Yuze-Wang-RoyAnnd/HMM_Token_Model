i gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie, but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience. the story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old clich'e by now, but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purple.<br /><br />it also showed a different side to the african-american experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. i find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-oscar trend.<br /><br />also the acting performances are superb - especially oprah who i now have a new found respect for.<br /><br />well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy.
