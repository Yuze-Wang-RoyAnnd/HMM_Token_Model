this is, by all categories, the best movie i have ever seen. forget hollywood - their movies always sucked - this is art! moon child's story starts with kei - a japanese vampire, who loathes what he has become and lives in denial. his wish for final death leads him to mallepa, where refugees from several asian countries live. here, he meets sho, an orphan living on the street.<br /><br />from here, the movie is an intense experience which bases on the visual and emotional part of the movie. it has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy... never has a movie touched me the way this movie do. and the actors are amazing - never have i heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange. a big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece...<br /><br />a last comment on this brilliant movie, is that it stars gackt (ex-vocalist of malice mizer) and hyde (vocalist of l'arc~en~ciel) in excellent roles as sho and kei. i am amazed at how gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out.<br /><br />this is a must see. if you never see any films, see moon child, the crow (brandon lee) and the newly released masterpiece final fantasy vii - advent children. all in their original languages, of course!
