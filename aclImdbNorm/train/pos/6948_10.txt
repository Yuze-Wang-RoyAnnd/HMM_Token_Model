the first time i saw this episode was like a shock to me, it was actually the first time i saw "24". the speed things are happening is amazing, and it's so surprising, thrilling, and even interesting, it's almost as if you are reading a book; once you start it, it's very hard to stop. from the minute richard walsh was talking privately to jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside ctu, i was sitting 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes!!! (sounds funny and crazy, but i'm the kind of guy which when he is interested he just can't stop)this series is one of the best of it's kind. and it's build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together. recommended in every way!
