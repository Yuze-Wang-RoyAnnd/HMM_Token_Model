the early career of abe lincoln is beautifully presented by ford. not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real lincoln, but fonda, wearing a fake nose, is uncanny as lincoln, with the voice, delivery, walk, and other mannerisms - exactly as one would imagine lincoln to have been. ford, in the first of three consecutive films he made with fonda, is at the top of his form, perfectly evoking early 19th century america. the story focuses on a pair accused of murder that lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done. the supporting cast includes many of ford's regulars. this was alice brady's last film, as she died months after its release.
