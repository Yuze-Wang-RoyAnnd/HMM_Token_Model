the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarah's own stand up; it's so over the top with prejudice that you can't possibly take it to heart. the fact is, though, that while most all people will "get it," it doesn't mean they will all appreciate it. it's a very polarizing and one dimensional show, so if you don't like it after 10 minutes, you may as well give up there. if you do like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because every episode thus far has been as good as the last.<br /><br />like all shows, though, it is not perfect. personally i love the program, but there are some huge faults with it. racist songs are funny, but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize--a problem that i had with "jesus is magic" as well. it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesn't need to exist. not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good, the music, well, isn't.<br /><br />another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python, upright citizens brigade, etc., it is nothing like those shows. i can watch monty python all day, but, as much as i like this show, i can't watch more than the half hour limit at a time. it gets flat very fast. the repeat value for this show is low too--the second time around an episode is fairly funny, and by the third time, in my opinion, it's boring.<br /><br />still, that first time around is very, very funny. give it a shot.
