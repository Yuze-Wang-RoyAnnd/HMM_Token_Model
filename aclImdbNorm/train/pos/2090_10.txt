this is where the term "classic film" comes from. this is a wonderful story of a woman's bravery, courage and extreme loyalty. poor olan got sold to her uncaring husband, who through the years learned to appreciate her. (yeah right, a pearl!!) <br /><br />luise rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress oscar the year before for her small role (and what a waste of an oscar) in "the great zigfield". it really didn't show what, if any, talent she had other than her exotic beauty. but in "good earth" she shows that she can really act! her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either. people say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film. like hell. her character olan is a shy and timid woman, with inner strength. she is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot. if you people are saying that she doesn't act well in this film, you are not looking!<br /><br />paul muni shows that he can act as well. his character is not a likeable one to me. he never sees her for what she is, until the very end of the story. a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special beauty. the greatest one of all, the beauty from within, like a pearl.<br /><br />if you get a chance to see this film, watch it. you will see one of the best films that the golden age of hollywood created.
