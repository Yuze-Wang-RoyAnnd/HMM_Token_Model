one of the most underrated movies i've seen in a long time, bill & ted's bogus journey is the second hilarious adventure of bill s. preston esq. and ted theodore logan, aka wyld stallyns. there are two ways to look at this film: first, you see dumb dialogue, far fetched plot, juvenile idea. or.. you see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains. throw a bruce willis or a arnold schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie. bill and ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity, only it's bill and ted. this is a tricky fence to balance on, but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy, but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure, it becomes so much more.
