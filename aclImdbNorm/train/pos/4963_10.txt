leave it to braik to put on a good show. finally he and zorak are living their own lives outside of spac ghost coast to coast. i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot. they are completely what started adult swim. brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000. it may not have been platinum, but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love adult swims shows. i have to say that out of all the adult swim shows with no plot, this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made. that is why i like it so much, it is just such a classic in the adult swim history. i believe this is just such a great show, if you don't like it. hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it.
