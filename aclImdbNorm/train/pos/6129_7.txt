note that i did not say that it is better...just more enjoyable. the lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving.<br /><br />i was actually sort of surprised that this was not a troma movie, as it has all the troma trademarks, including spewing acidic liquids, wisecracks from the villain after every murder, a ridiculous bathtub rape scene (which is sort of hard to get upset about, since the rapist is a snowman), and dumb deputies.<br /><br />there's a lot to love: <br /><br />1. a snowman, about whom it is remarked that he has no legs or feet, drives a police cruiser around town.<br /><br />2. even though it is supposed to be close to (or below) freezing, nobody's breath shows and there are no signs of car exhaust when cars are running.<br /><br />3. the snow reminds you more of flocking or styrofoam peanuts than actual snow.<br /><br />4. a teenage girl gets the hots for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is gruesomely murdered. she talks him into breaking into the sheriff's house, of all places, in order to get it on. but first, she tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine.<br /><br />5. after teen-aged jake's head is cut off by a sled runner, his father argues with the sheriff about whether tommy, the sheriff's son, had anything to do with it. the sheriff maintains that tommy wouldn't have been fighting with jake because jake "is at least two feet taller than tommy." at that moment, someone in the background chimes in, "not anymore!" <br /><br />6. when the evil snowman finally starts to melt away, the sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made out of some sort of fabric for an extended period. this is much better than tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions. if i were an actor, i would not have been able to keep a straight face at this point.<br /><br />all in all, a fun film. there's not really even that much blood.
