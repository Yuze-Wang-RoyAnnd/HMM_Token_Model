a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on "the real mccoys" tv series. i said then and repeat now it was a charming, funny, and entertaining show, well-acted with wonderful characterizations.<br /><br />i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna, kathy nolan, and tony martinez. as another writer here mentioned, it is curious that lydia reed (hassie) and michael winkelman (little luke) weren't refered to, but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftra.<br /><br />the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show. one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute, which left luke a "widow" in it's last year, which wasn't very good. nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called "broadside", about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii. get it? broadside? no, not funny.<br /><br />unlike the sleazy, salacious, and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values, "the real mccoys" entertained with decent values and fine human beings. and i thank all involved, including the creator, irving pinkus, for having brought it to my family. we never missed it.
