i first saw this movie on some movie channel (hbo?) some time ago. i was a fan of public enemy, nwa and other early rap and had seen cb4 in theaters. anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and i wanted to see what it was all about. well, right off the bat i knew it was going to be good (warning!) and i was right. the parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over (my peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. you've got to love the satire of rap groups (obviously nwa), certain rappers (eazy e, flava flav, ice cube), and the humor of the three members of nwh. who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass? it's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by cb4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much better film. if you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. if you aren't into or don't like 'rap', you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.
