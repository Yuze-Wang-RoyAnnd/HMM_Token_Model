<br /><br />this movie is by far one of my favorites. i saw it while in college in the early 90's, and while i couldn't identify with the thirtysomethings in the film, i felt that the story, characters, and movie in general were top notch. to the people who spoke negatively of indian summer, feel free to stick to your overblown armageddon-type movies and leave the movies with a great, wholesome story to those who can appreciate them.
