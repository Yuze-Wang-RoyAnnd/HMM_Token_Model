i couldn't find anyone to watch dig! with me because no one i knew was a fan of either of the bands. naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either the dandy warhols or the brian jonestown massacre, but this is so far from the truth. the only requirement is that you have an interest in music and/or pop culture in general. the way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take, and watching the public eat up and spit out the dandy warhols is fascinating. i agree with other reviews that mention it would be nice to get a final word from anton himself, since he's clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the bulwark to the band's ability to just remain.<br /><br />most interesting to me is the dandys' respect for the bjm (despite their lack or reciprocation) and for anton (despite his erratic behavior). the dandy warhols respect the art the group produces even if the group hates everything the dandy warhols now stand for (although that's disputable). the best line is when the drummer for the dandy's says "i won't have them anywhere new me again" and the guitarist unconsciously blurts out "i'll still buy their records though." to me, this just shows how powerful good music can be.<br /><br />definitely see this movie, even if you know nothing of either band. it's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting. it's rare to follow a group so closely for so long.
