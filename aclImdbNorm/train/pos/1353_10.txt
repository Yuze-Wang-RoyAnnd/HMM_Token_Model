the cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team "networth" vs . the supposed professional team "magna" but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you'd be right. while the magna team has struggled at times, the street team has simply disintegrated week after week.<br /><br />first some things to reiterate as far as the "apprentice 3" first of it continues the same absurd mentality (from trump) and the game in this series: if your a good project manager, but you lose, the team will turn on you and you will be fired, despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs. simply absurd, that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually "weeds" out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best . lol<br /><br />anyone this season, weve seen a total of cursing, backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns.<br /><br />the list of victims so far cast tara dowdell , audrey evans , danny kastner those three are the only that i feel were unfairly fired by trump, the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict, anger and suffering. it's just amazing as one candidate audrey evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game.<br /><br />yes its the game, it's "the apprentice" where manipulation, backstabbing, and always popular "everyone gang up on the project manager" mentality rules.<br /><br />it has been an entertaining ride, though, the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses, to building of new apartments.<br /><br />still though it's still the "apprentice" though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner.
