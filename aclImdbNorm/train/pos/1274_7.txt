notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book.<br /><br />i don't understand this type of criticism. books and films are different media. while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, films have about 120 minutes. yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, audio, as well as the imagination. i don't care if a film is as good as or, in fact, has any resemblance to the book on which it is based. who cares? i judge it for what it is.<br /><br />this tv movie was charming. an old and oft-seen story, prone to clich'e, it could easily have been embarrassing. however, riffen and reeves pull it off. one reviewer found riffen far to old. i would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film. it is to her credit as an actress that she played a 23-24 year old amazingly well. i also think it is about the best thing reeves ever did. the story could have been stronger, and i agree the screen play could have used "tightening." nonetheless, it is well worth watching; clearly not a powerful love story, but rather, a charming romance which will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil. and it is nice to see a "love story" without the obligatory f#$% word, the naked buttocks, or hours of spit-swapping kissing.<br /><br />lastly, the musical score is excellent.
