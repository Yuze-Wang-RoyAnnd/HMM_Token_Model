even if you know absolutely nothing about ireland, you have to love "my left foot" (and especially daniel day-lewis' performance in it). he plays cerebral palsy-afflicted christy brown. due to this, he has spent most of his life ostracized. even when trying to warn people about something, they just laugh at him. the light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part: his left foot. he uses that appendage to paint and write poetry, bringing him to prominence.<br /><br />daniel day-lewis and director jim sheridan did very well on this collaboration, and also on a later collaboration: "in the name of the father" (but "the boxer" was unnecessary). "my left foot" can make you feel many ways: sad, hopeful, or something else. but in any case, daniel day-lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here. a great movie in every sense.
