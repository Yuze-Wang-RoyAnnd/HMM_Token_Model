this is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises, but who love the history and traditions of sci-fi and classic hollywood movies. each alien of the martian crew is the embodiment of a classic sci-fi character or member of hollywood royalty and it's pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of big bean.
