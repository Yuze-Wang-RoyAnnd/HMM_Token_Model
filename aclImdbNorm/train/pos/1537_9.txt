the movie takes place in a little swedish town where everybody knows each other. here mia visits her parent for the birthday of her father, a which occasionally always have some kind of tragedy, the question is just what will it be this year, and you will be surprised... it is an extremely well composed movie, with a story which has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen. you get happy, you get hurt, and basically everything in between. finally you can't help falling in love with mia(if you are a boy i guess(the main actress)) she is an extremely well chosen actress, as a lot of the other actors/actresses.<br /><br />enjoy
