quite simply the funniest and shiniest film-comedy of all time... it's certainly on my personal top-ten list. this one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale. millionaire heir, arthur bach (moore), is a middle-aged 'child' who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities. he also refuses to leave the bottle. one day he and his personal butler, hobson (gielgud), go shopping at bergdorf goodman's and run into petty larcenist, linda (minnelli). arthur and linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. there are hilarious set pieces aplenty. in one such scene, arthur (drunk throughout most of the story) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human 'siren' ("my husband has a gun!!!!). performances by everyone involved should be duly noted: geraldine fitzgerald plays arthur's loving-yet-ruthless grandmother, sir john gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll-isms (he took home the oscar for this one), and christopher cross provides the main theme song (oscar winner "best that you can do"). it's a shame the late dudley moore passed away last month (march 2002).
