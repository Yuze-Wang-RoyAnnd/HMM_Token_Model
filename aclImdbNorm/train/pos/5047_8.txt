actor paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling, dark, and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic (paxton himself) who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders, claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but "demons", and that they have been selected by god to destroy these "demons". this is all told in flashback by one of the sons, now grown up (matthew mcconaughey) to skeptical fbi agent (powers boothe).<br /><br />hard to automatically forget this film; better than most serial killer features, it's a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks. paxton, commendably, barely shows any blood at all until near the end. well acted by all, especially the two child actors (jeremy sumpter of the recent "peter pan" and matt o'leary of "spy kids 2" and "domestic disturbance"). the only reason i deducted any points at all is because i can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach. in any event, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script.<br /><br />8/10
