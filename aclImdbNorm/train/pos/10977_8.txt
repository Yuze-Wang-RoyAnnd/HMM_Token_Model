i took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical.(!) most of the comments here are on target, it's moving, funny, sad, and yes, a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. the expanded chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /><br />i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of jackie o too; people just don't talk like that anymore. i think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, old edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't she see the once spectacular home disintegrating? <br /><br />yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life tennesse williams one act. well worth your time.
