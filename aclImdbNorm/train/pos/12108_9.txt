yakitate! ja-pan (translated as fresh baked! japanese bread) is the story of a young man named azuma kazuma and his journey to make the perfect japanese bread or ja-pan, for japan, and for the japanese, that will be recognized the the whole world.<br /><br />of course, that's just on the outside. in reality, yakitate! ja-pan isn't really about the bread, but the reaction that come after eating the bread, and the pun that comes with the reaction. the series is lovable because of these puns. from popular anime titles like naruto, detective conan, and dragon ball to blockbuster movies like the matrix and lord of the rings. it's all there.<br /><br />so what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre like cooking master boy or mr. ajikko? well, unlike the others who use cooking for world domination, yakitate! ja-pan is purely comedy. sure, there are times that the story turns to drama, or even murder, but the comedic atmosphere makes you laugh at them. you'll be laughing at their own view of heaven. just watch it.<br /><br />just remember that this is also fiction, although some of the bread made here are based on real bread, eating the home made japan #2 won't turn you to a super saiyan or turn your body to rubber.
