strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle-aged man (william h. macy) who finally decides to leave the family business (murder for hire) run by his quietly over-demanding father (donald sutherland) while seeing a shrink (john ritter) and flirting with another patient (neve campbell).<br /><br />talk about a major dilemma, but "panic" is a top-notch thriller that looks like "american beauty" meets "the professional". macy and sutherland are the stand-outs here. remarkable debut for first-time writer/director henry bromell. i'm surprised that this movie didn't get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks.
