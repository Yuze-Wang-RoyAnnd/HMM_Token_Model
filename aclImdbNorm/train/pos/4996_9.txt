i've seen tons of hk actioners, and this one is right at the top of the genre. the action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie. the kung fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnics eye-popping, the stunt work heartstopping. the editing is perfectly paced, heightening the tension and complimenting the fluid camera work. this film is directed by old pro corey yuen, whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre, including the jet li vehicle the legend of fong sai-yuk. if there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, though martin, the male lead, comes closest to it. this movie is full of archetypes rather than characters--the sexy killer, the goofy thief and his bitchy girlfriend, the cackling villains. that said, shannon lee has a terrific screen presence; she's great with the fighting, the stunts, and the guns. when she's onscreen it's hard to take your eyes off her. she's that good. why isn't this woman a major star?
