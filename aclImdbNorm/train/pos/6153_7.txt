the obvious parallels between walt disney's charming fantasy bedknobs and broomsticks and c.s. lewis chronicles of narnia are pretty apparent. there are more coincidences here than comparing bedknobs and broomsticks than with mary poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two disney films.<br /><br />like the chronicles of narnia it involves some english children leaving london during the blitz and coming to live in the country. and those kids have to deal with a world of magic. but unlike c.s. lewis the rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now. no retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the pevensie kids.<br /><br />no heavy duty philosophy here from walt disney except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like angela lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like david tomlinson. ms. lansbury didn't get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing. she carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at disney couldn't top. and they won an oscar for the magic kingdom in that department for this film.<br /><br />two performers made their farewell to films in bedknobs and broomsticks. tessie o'shea played her last role in this film, she graced many a film in the united kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers. and that grand character actor reginald owen as the retired general who leads the old home guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world.<br /><br />the team of robert b. sherman and richard m. sherman who wrote the score for mary poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here. the age of not believing was nominated for an oscar, but lost to the theme from shaft. personally though i do like david tomlinson's tribute to that most colorful of london streets, portabello road.<br /><br />bedknobs and broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years. imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics.
