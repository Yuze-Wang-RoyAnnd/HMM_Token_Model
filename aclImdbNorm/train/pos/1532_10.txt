this, like murder she wrote, is one of those shows, that after a stressful day at school, i sit down in front of the tv, and watch. why? because i genuinely enjoy it, and it's a shame it's not on the air anymore. dick van dyke is amazing as dr mark sloan, a doctor-turned-detective, who with his son, solves murders. he is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast, namely his real-life son, barry van dyke. victoria rowell is also good, but i noticed that every series her hairstyle changes. i also liked scott baio and charlie schlatter, but i particularly loved michael tucci as norman, and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared. this show is so entertaining,with great guest stars, it's a bit obvious at times, like colombo, but in every episode, there is always something to chuckle about. in conclusion, a great series, with two thumbs up and a 10/10. bethany cox
