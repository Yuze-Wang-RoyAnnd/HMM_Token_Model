<br /><br />an old man works as a janitor in a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is a patient there and to try to get her out.<br /><br />this is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and an oddity in the history of japanese cinema. long thought lost, a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack added to it, which fits perfectly with the images. it might have been influenced by cabinet of doctor caligary (director kinugasa claimed he never saw the german film). however it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing (and chilly) portray of the inner mental state of the inmates in the asylum. to achieve this, the film makes use of every single film technique available at the time: multiple exposures and out of focus subjective point of view, tilted camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist lighting and superimpositions among others. it is also a very complicated film to follow, as it has not got intertitles.<br /><br />the film opens with a montage of shots of rain hitting the windows of the hospital, wind shaking trees and of thunder. the unsettling weather metaphors the mental condition of the patients and introduces one of the them: a former dancer. the combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as the music that incites the dancer to get into a frantic, almost hypnotic dance. in another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenzied dance, she is being watched by other inmates. multiple exposures of the dancer represent the patients' point of view and their confused "view" of the world.<br /><br />these are just two examples from this amazing film trying to represent the patients' subconscious and view of the "sane" world.<br /><br />in three words a must see.
