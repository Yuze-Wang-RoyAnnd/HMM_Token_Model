with ralph bakshi most of his films appear to be like two-edged swords. you'll get something awesome out of it but only if you put up with the silly and the unnecessarily cheezy. the lord of the rings was a great adaptation of the story which perhaps didn't always shine in the animation department.<br /><br />fire and ice is a great achievement from bakshi from an animation point of view. the rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it. you still get some of the dull still-cells and slightly blurred background paintings but on the over-all the look has definitely gotten better since bakshi's last fantasy epic. the animation has almost a realistic-naturalistic style to it, and unlike in lotr where this style was often at odds with the actual content, here it enhances the film's unique atmosphere.<br /><br />unfortunately the film fails to create a meaningful story out of its simple setting and in fact most of the characters' motivations are pretty blurred. lorn and tigra are easy cases but even the main villain necron was difficult to follow not to mention that guy with furry face mask (also known as just 'that guy'). even though most of the voice actor's were appropriate, there are some odd quirks in the audio-department and tigra especially sounds really terrible whenever she's screaming.<br /><br />however, i believe the film's inherent entertainment value outweighs its unnecessarily silly execution of the plot-line. the scant clad of the characters is something you'll never get over but it helps you remind yourself that perhaps this film isn't even intended to be taken too seriously. it's still a hella cool and really funny.
