the director and two stars of laura (1944) were reteamed for this solid policier: dana andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and, one night, he goes too far; gene tierney is the estranged wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who has become involved with the town's leading racketeer and andrews' no. 1 nemesis, gary merrill (who had himself been the prot'eg'e of andrews snr.)! as usual with preminger, this is a well-crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes karl malden (as andrews' incumbent superior), tom tully (as tierney's motor-mouth taxi driver dad) and neville brand (as merrill's chief thug), with notable support also coming from craig stevens (as the slimy, wife-beating victim), bert freed (as andrews' sympathetic partner) and robert f. nolan (as andrews' stern outgoing superior). having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else, andrews panics and impersonates stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the (in this case) wrong tracks of merrill; however, after tully becomes the prime suspect (by which time andrews and tierney are romantically involved), the cop goes by himself in merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder! clearly, the protagonist is a complex character and andrews rises to the challenge with a first-rate characterization that is typically complemented by the in-house fox noir style.
