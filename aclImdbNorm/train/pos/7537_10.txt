contrary to what those who hate christianity, the 700 club provides real answers as well as inspiration. it also provides reliable news, logical commentary and a different view than what abc, cbs, nbc and pbs thinks is best. unlike other programs, which provide social and faith-related commentary, those who are behind the 700 club provide help for those in need, such as feeding the hungry with operation blessing, providing medical help to those living in poverty-stricken communities and giving hope to those who need hope. it's not at all hateful. if the 700 club offends you, i suggest reaching for the remote control and turning the channel on your tv set. i do the same thing when i find cnn headline news or for that matter, programs which i find biased or offensive. what i find offensive is the way that the abc family inserts the disclaimer that the views of the 700 club do not reflect those of abc family.
