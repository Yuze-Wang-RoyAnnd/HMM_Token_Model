being from a small town in illinois myself, i can instantly relate to this movie. considering the era it was made in, the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people i grew up with. yes the plot is so-so. and yes, the acting is not going to get nominated for an oscar anytime soon. but that isn't the point. the point is to suspend reality and just have fun. and this movie has fun aplenty. from the greedy,uncaring banker to the well meaning,but dimwitted deputy, this movie was made to poke fun at the scifi genre and small town living at it's best. who can't smile at the sight of the enforcer drone or the vern droid? and i loved the farmzoid. wish i had one when i was growing up. overall, considering the technology they had available at the time, this is a pleasant romp into one's childhood, when you could sit back on a saturday afternoon, popcorn in hand, and laugh at the foibles of small town living. this is a movie i would watch again and again, if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways.
