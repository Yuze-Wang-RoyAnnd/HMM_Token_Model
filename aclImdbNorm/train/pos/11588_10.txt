this movie was great and i would like to buy it.the boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops. the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe.the eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up. later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their arrows were marked very close the same. only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer. but this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even crueler to him,and at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was.please if anyone knows where i can buy this movie let me know.i haven't seen it for over 30 years,but still remember parts of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
