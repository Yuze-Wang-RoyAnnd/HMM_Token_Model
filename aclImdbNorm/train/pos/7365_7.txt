i found this very touching as spike and heaton stay together all the way through this film not to say there isn't a few betrayals along the way. i thought the chase was put aside the relationship between the two was foreground i think. i had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of heaton. my favourite scene had to be the bit where heaton and spike were stuck in the marsh and spike runs off i generally thought spike wasn't coming back. i have to say that if it wasn't for our film studies teacher making us watch this i would have probably never seen it. overall i thought this film was pretty good and i would recommend it to any person who is a fan of british made films.
