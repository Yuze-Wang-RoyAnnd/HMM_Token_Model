the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first. the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. however, i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem. i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy -- sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable to sedaris' jerri blank.<br /><br />the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast. her sister's character is good; funny at times, but ultimately meant not to steal sarah's show. however, the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison.<br /><br />i'm glad, though, that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor.
