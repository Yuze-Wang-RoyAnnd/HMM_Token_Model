wow! i loved this movie and love judy marte!! this girl isn't just an awesome pretty face, she's funny and really really talented!! she made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with victor who was desperately hitting on her! we'll be seeing her a lot in the next coming years... and probably also from director peter sollett and co-star victor rasuk!<br /><br />raising victor vargas is one of the best film i saw in a long time! very refreshing! it's true, nice, funny, well filmed, it got it all : good story, good actors, good film direction!<br /><br />if you like simple, slow paced, real life, urban movies, like maybe jersey girl from kevin smith, you'll love victor vargas! it's better!
