a very gritty, gutsy portrayal of a part of world war 2 history, that most of us in the u.s. had/have no idea ever occurred. i would love to have this on video. it only was shown on t.v. one time as far as i know, back in 89or 90. i have asked around for this movie, and most video stores don't even know about it. great actresses all around, wish that i could see it again. top notch series.
