i must admit, i was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. i determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by ronald d. moore wielding the retcon-wand.<br /><br />i was wrong!<br /><br />the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers. the accessibility is marvelous! of course, seasoned bsg veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of the cylons before the first war. (58 years before the events of the bsg pilot). the pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.<br /><br />don't be mistaken: "caprica" is not bsg. we are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama dotted by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas. <br /><br />the casting maintains bsg's standards; stoltz and morales are simply astounding. morales' portrayal of joseph adama, inspired by olmos' portrayal of william, gives a wonderful glimpse of william's heroic father. stoltz's portrayal of dr. graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.<br /><br />if the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come, rdm and the creative team are set to continue bsg's legacy of first-rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece.
