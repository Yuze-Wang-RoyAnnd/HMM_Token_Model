after seeing the movie last night i was left with a sense of the hopelessness faced by organisations trying to tackle the problem the film portrays. the scale of the prostitution seems so large that it's hard to see how it can be defeated without major governmental changes in cambodia.<br /><br />anyway, on with the review.<br /><br />although it is a sombre movie with an uncomfortable central relationship this is a very compelling film, and i'd even go so far as to say it was enjoyable. the film was well edited for the running time and the performance by thuy nguyen was excellent. i also felt ron livingston played a very difficult role well.<br /><br />it would have been nice to have a little more insight into why patrick feels he has to help holly, but maybe the reason is a simple as he explains to chris penn's character. i won't explain it here - go see the movie.<br /><br />this is a good, thought-provoking film with obviously good intentions. i hope it gets a wide enough release to reach a decent sized audience and gain more support for the k-11 project.
