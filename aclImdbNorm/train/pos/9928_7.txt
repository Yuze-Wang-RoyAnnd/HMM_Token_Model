as soon as i knew keira knighteley being in this flick, i said "i have to watch this movie". she's the undisputed main character, domino, a bounty hunter. her "job", as the "no action" scenes would teach us, reflects her rebel, violent attitude to life. i have to admit that it's the very first time that i watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands. so, this stomped me a bit. anyway, for all the john woo's fans, there are helicopters falling down, explosions, gunfire as if it would rain, and a lovely keira that shoots with two machine guns, one per hand. the cast is absolutely brilliant. going beyond keira, which in this movie is a real tomboy, pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see, mickey rourke is back, with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body. christopher walken makes his job pretty well, as a reality show producer.<br /><br />let's go to the contents: this movie has a journalistic shape. the talk show scene is "disgustingly" real. anyone that watched that load of . . . you-know-what, can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations. as well as the producer, when domino's mom says that the reality that should show domino's life is "trash; no offense", he answers "i don't take it like an offense". this movie portrays a difficult life. domino, coming from a world that didn't want her, ed (mickey rourke), a bounty hunter "not so bounty", choco (the third guy of the band), which family is (using ed's words), "the correctional institutes he's been", and alf, the driver/bomber coming from afghanistan during the russian occupation. this bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born "without the shirt"; unlucky, violent, and with nothing to lose, excepts their (as they would consider) miserable lives. the intro of the movie says that it is "inspired by true story . . . more or less", so i couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true. anyway, going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons (which could have been "added" to make the film easier to see, and be classified as an action movie), the characters' story is too realistic to be "edulcorated". <br /><br />the interaction between the characters is various, well studied, and definitely not boring. what hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist (lucy liu, sober as never in her acting career). it represents only the reason by which domino starts telling her story (and that's a story). probably, the only "con", in a movie with a lot of "pros". <br /><br />all in all: this isn't "swat". the characters are crafted; they have an identity, a shape. they have a name and a surname (not just "gamble" and "street"). it's the case to say, it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet.
