this is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. from the very start i was utterly hooked into the (true) story when lt. viktor burakov (stephan rea) weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. this then is the compelling story of andrei chikatilo, wonderfully played by jeffrey demunn (the green mile). in fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is. the psychiatrist dr. alexandr bukhanovsky, wonderfully played by max von sydow was utterly believable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the soviet union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local communist commissar bondarchuk played by joss ackland. for me though, the outstanding performance was from donald sutherland, proving once again what a superb character actor he really is. i was almost in tears when he told burakov how the fbi had so closely followed and admired his work. this film puts silence of the lambs into the shade, from the atmospheric and bleak soviet landscape, to the superlative performances by everyone involved. <br /><br />i rate this film 10/10
