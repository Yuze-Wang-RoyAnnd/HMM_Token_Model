i have to say that sometimes "looks" are all that matters, just like jeremy clarkson from bbc has pointed out (not about our earth though, but he is right anyway).<br /><br />and when it comes to looks, this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see.<br /><br />and then there's the personality of the movie as well, interesting, with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images.<br /><br />the movie probably won't affect your lifestyle, ruining these beauties, but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is.<br /><br />this movie deserves it's 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed.
