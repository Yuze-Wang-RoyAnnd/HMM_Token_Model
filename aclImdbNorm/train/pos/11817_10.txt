i saw dick tracy when i was very young. i didn't know who any of the actors were, and i didn't know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed. i sure loved it though.<br /><br />warren beatty stars as the crime-fighting 1930's detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city. this time, big boy caprice (al pacino) has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney (madonna) who has her eye on tracy. it becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. he or she is very unknown. plus, the famous villians are back from the comic book collection.<br /><br />i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative. it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child. warren beaty was just like james bond of the 1930's the way he played dick tracy.<br /><br />an ensemble cast of the film includes: charlie korsmo, glenn headly, william forsythe, dustin hoffman, james caan, ed o' ross, tommy lee jones, mandy patinkin, charles durning. plus more!<br /><br />dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy. take my word for it.
