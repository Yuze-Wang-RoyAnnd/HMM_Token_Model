it has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately i don't seem to be able to rent it in the video store, only the other version but i fell in love with it. i was always borderline with the other emma. gwenneth and toni collette, as they are not british naturally have to put on the accent, and well to me it doesn't seem natural. it seems put on. sorry but don't think toni and gwenneth did a brilliant job there. i could not warm to any of the characters, but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person i imagined emma to be. it is definitely the version i will come back to from now on. i was disappointed that mr knightley was not better looking, but he is convincing. i also like jane fairfax better (played by olivia williams). i never warmed to her in the movie version, but she is better portrayed in this version. come to think of it, (besides mr knightley) all characters are better played, and a lot less over the top. unfortunately both came out around same time and the paltrow version got more publicity. pity...... i also love the new scene at the end. well done to kate beckingsale! therefore, if you are a jane austen fan, don't forget to watch this one.
