you'll notice by the stars i've given this great film that '...before you see it the first time,' is implied. i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not much great coming in). i'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too. still, it did.<br /><br />this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget. it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. the entire film is you (the viewer) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns. i would have given this film 10/10, however some of the shots were pretty fake looking. i don't hold that against this film too much, but i don't think it deserves a perfect score.<br /><br />lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). i think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent. nevermind her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion. and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed, as well.<br /><br />jeremy northam does really well, at first, as quite a geeky corporate rat, willing to run through any maze to prove himself. however, as he changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. i know some fans of clive owen, jude law, or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this, but northam would/could/should fit that bill. he's suave and cultured. he's got a great bond posture and voice. i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it, and rather down-to-earth, as well.<br /><br />great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films.
