not having read nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, i could only view "the luzhin defence" as a movie. <br /><br />it works really well as one of my favorite genres "sports romances." the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in, say "searching for bobby fischer," in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be, requiring thought, preparation, stamina and planning. i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated.<br /><br />through the feminist director maureen gorris (of "antonia"), emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.<br /><br />the settings in italy and hungary are beautiful.<br /><br />(originally written 5/27/2001)
