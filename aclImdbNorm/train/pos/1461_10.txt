the film exposes the blatant exploitation of the chinese worker - generally female - garnering footage from the chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint, his american counterpart also as unashamed and delusional, the oppressed workers who are given a voice and, of course, the drunken americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in new orleans. <br /><br />the glimmer of hope comes when some americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like $0.10 per hour to do so. you also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory, but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and/or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor.<br /><br />i have wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them. i just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact american indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world. honorable mention goes to wal-mart. it is simply amazing. and clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
