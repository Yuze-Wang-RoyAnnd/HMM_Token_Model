i am and was very entertained by the movie. it was my all time favorite movie of 1976. being raised in the 70's , i was so in love with kris kristoffersons look and demeanor,of course i am no movie critic,but for the time era,i think it was very good. i very much like the combo of streisand and kristofferson. i thought they worked very well together. i have seen the movie many times and still love the two of them as esther and john norman. i am a very huge fan of kris and see him in concert when i can. what a talented singer song writer,not to mention,actor. i have seen him in many movies,but still think back to a star is born.
