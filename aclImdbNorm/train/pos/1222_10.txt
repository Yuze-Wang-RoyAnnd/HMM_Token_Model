i spied this short on a dvd of best new zealand shorts, all great but the french doors was amazing. it starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen. just as you relax into the hum drum of home renovation, the most spookiest thing happens. <br /><br />eeeekkk, i wanted to stop watching, but i was glued. <br /><br />the films dips into the primal fear of the dark and with little, if not any, special effects. it chills you right to the bone. a simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when i was young and dream't up the most improbably but spooky situations. <br /><br />the film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story. it is a quality short that i haven't seen in quite some time. <br /><br />the french doors has all the hallmarks of a great feature, alas it finishes after ten minutes or so. never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more. <br /><br />loved it and well done and thanks for the ride. these new zealanders are really turning out the talent.<br /><br />a new fan.
