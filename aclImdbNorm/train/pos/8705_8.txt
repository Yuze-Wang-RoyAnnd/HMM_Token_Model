despite the title, the sword bearer, and the dvd cover (action/herioc poses of the sword bearer) this is not a super hero film.<br /><br />(minor spoilers) it follows the tale of sasha, the sword bearer, who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm. cool you say, but no, this is real life. if you had this power as a child could you control it when, say, faced by a mad man, or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her. and if you don't control it, how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12.<br /><br />this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him. wandering aimlessly after another killing (much like a bout de souffl'e). he then meet katya, and the pair fall instantly in love, providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways. however, his past is still chasing him, in the form of two police officers.<br /><br />that is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on screen, though a lot if suggested.<br /><br />i really like this movie. unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films, we get very little back story, there is no bad guy (unless you count the sword bearer himself) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development.<br /><br />worth checking out if you can find it.
