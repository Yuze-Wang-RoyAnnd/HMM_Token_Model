"hollywood north" is an euphemism from the movie industry as they went to canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like toronto, in this case, later in vancouver. peter o'brian, the director, probably saw a lot of the invaders from california that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the economics that canada presented.<br /><br />needless to say, "moon lantern", the successful novel written by a canadian author is turned into "flight to bogota", which has nothing to do with the original film. a great egotistical has-been, michael baytes, who is obsessed with what is happening in iran, is offered the lead part, which turns to be a disaster.<br /><br />the film seems to be saying that too many cooks have spoiled the broth, which seems to be the case with the ultimate product, which is saved by its producer, bobby myers. with the help of sandy ryan, who has been around making a documentary of the film being shot in toronto, parts of the film are transformed into a cohesive movie at last.<br /><br />the filming process is hilarious, and the acting, in general, is good.
