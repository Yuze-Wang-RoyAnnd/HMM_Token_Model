what an amazingly funny and original show. the cast starting with the hysterical julie brown(homecoming queen's got a gun) is just perfect. add amy hill(all american girl-grandma kim) who plays a lesbian who is always arguing with her partner and business partner(asian restaurant-wok-don"t run) i have laughed harder during this show than any other i have ever seen(including newhart-one of my all time favorite shows) if you like movies like naked gun and airplane- you will love this series!! one of the best moments of the show is cindy williams playing herself. when she snubs tammy at the dry cleaners, tammy finds a picture of cindy williams in her coat. the picture is of cindy williams doing an unmentionable act with a bowling pin-upside down. it is awesome to see an actress like cindy williams being able to play herself like this. soap opera like with many surprise twists during its short run. i can only hope that this will someday be released on dvd with special many bonus special features. funniest series i have ever seen!!!!
