i have seen this movie when i was about 7 years old - which was 33 years ago - and i never forgot this movie! i was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle. and i just couldn't believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die...<br /><br />my sister was in the movie with me and i asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday. so it isn't just me.<br /><br />this movie is a must see !!!<br /><br />you will never forget it - just like my sister and me...
