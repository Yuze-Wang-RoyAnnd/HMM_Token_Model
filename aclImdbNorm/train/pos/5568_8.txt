a typical romp through cheech and chong's reality which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, pee wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, stand up comedy, surprisingly more drugs and space coke !!. it is not as coherent or plausible as up in smoke but it still is incredibly funny, without becoming as strange as nice dreams. there are some classic scenes, which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work. also funny is cheech's song (mexican-americans) and chong's follow up song. another notable scene is the welfare office scene with jones (human noise machine), from the police academy series, and the old laughing man. all in all, this is a great follow up to up in smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not.<br /><br />-celluloid rehab
