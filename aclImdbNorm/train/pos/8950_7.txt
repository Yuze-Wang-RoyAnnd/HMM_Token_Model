for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart, this is one of his "lesser" films from later in his career. and, while it isn't a great film compared to many of his other pictures, it isn't bad and is a decent time-passer--but not much more.<br /><br />kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason, she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her. over time, the cold and detached ms. novak also begins to fall in love with stewart--and apparently in the witch's rule book, this is a definite no, no!! <br /><br />the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches. they are neither the baby-sacrificing nor the all-powerful variety. most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless (such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps). and, very oddly, the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz. considering what i think of jazz, it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world!<br /><br />anyway, the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic, but not something i would rush out to watch. the acting is pretty good, but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film--in fact, i almost scored the film a 6--it was really close.
