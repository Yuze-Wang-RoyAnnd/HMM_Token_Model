this film is one of the finest american b-movies of the 90s. if you're looking for a serious film, look elsewhere. however, if you're looking for some action, a lot of laughs, and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters, this is well worth watching. everyone chews the scenery a bit, but that's really what the film is all about, and everyone is quite funny. donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together.
