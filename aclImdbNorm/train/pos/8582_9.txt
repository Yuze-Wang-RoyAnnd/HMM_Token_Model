love the characters and the story line. very funny with plenty of action. thomas ian griffith and tia carrer give great performances. i enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of griffith and career. donald southerland plays a very likable, and surprisingly sympathetic, burnt out hit man. all three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat. a nice addition to my extensive dvd collection. i highly recommend this movie. if you like... mr. and mrs. smith, the replacement killers, l.a. confidential, the long kiss goodnight, the abyss and, the whole nine yards... you will love this movie.
