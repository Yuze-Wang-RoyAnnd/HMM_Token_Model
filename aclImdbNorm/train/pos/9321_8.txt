as romantic comedies go, this was a cute and winning one. i thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better, but that is not a huge tripping point. but, amanda detmer and scott wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever. these are two of my favorite actors, and i was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads. i hope to see them cast in more projects soon.<br /><br />overall, this movie won't change your life, but is is sweet, warm and winning. not a bad thing to be at all.
