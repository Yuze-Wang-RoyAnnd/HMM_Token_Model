although this movie has some weaknesses, it is worth seeing. i chose it because of the cast, and applaud bonham carter and branagh for choosing roles different from those they have taken in the past. both portray very troubled people, complete with warts, but make them likeable because of their humanity. the story is touching, but it is the performances that soar. bonham carter's "jane" is a remarkable achievement, whose quest for romance opened my eyes to aspects of being disabled that i had not thought of before, but was interesting as well for other reasons. i felt the movie ended too abruptly, but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending (see "stepmom.") the very real english setting added to my enjoyment - it was england in the 90's, both urban and rural, without being depressing.
