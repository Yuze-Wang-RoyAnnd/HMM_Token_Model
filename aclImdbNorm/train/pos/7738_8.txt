after dark, my sweet is a great, modern noir, filled with seedy characters, dirt roads, and, of course, sweaty characters. it seems that most of the truly great noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south, where the men glisten and the ladies, um, glisten too. why? because it's hooooottttttttttt. and because everyone looks better wet (at least the men do - sweaty women leave me clammy). <br /><br />anyway - there might be some spoilers in here. <br /><br />this film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be - steady pacing (though some with attention disorders refer to it as 'slow'), clearly and broadly drawn (though not simple) characters, and tons of atmosphere. noir, if anything, is about moods and attitudes. that's why the great ones are not marked by your traditional definitions of 'great' acting (look at bogart, mitchum, hurt, and nicholson - they (and their characters) were anything but real - but they had style and sass and in a crime movie that's exactly what you want). or quickly paced adventures (again all great noirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette). great noirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours. <br /><br />after dark my sweet let's you do that - and it let's you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. uncle bud and collie are intriguing - never allowing the audience to know what really makes them tick - and patric and dern (i love bruce dern, by the way) are pitch perfect, dern especially (see previous comment). they take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit our sympathies. <br /><br />the story itself is also interesting. there're better plots in the world of noir (hardly any mystery here - mostly it's suspense), but this one is solid. if anything, the simply 'okay' plot has more to do with jim thompson's writing than anything else. with thompson, plots are almost secondary; he eschewed the labyrinthine tales of hammett and chandler for simpler stories with stronger, more confusing characters. look at a novel like the killer inside me and and you'll see right away (from the title) what it's all about. when it comes to thompson, it's not what it's about, it's how it's about it (to quote roger ebert). so, really, the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and, if you don't like it, well the jokes on you. <br /><br />why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female lead. she's not bad, per se, but she's not angelica huston or anette benning (see the adaptation of jim thompson's the grifters if you don't know what i'm talking about - besides it's a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir - it's the best of the 1990s and challenges blood simple for the title of best since chinatown). she simply doesn't have the chops (or the looks for that matter) and though she and patric have some chemistry, i don't have it with her. so there.
