tea leoni plays nora wilde, a serious photographer, who is going through a bad divorce. she wants her freedom but it comes at a cost. she wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi. her boss is played by the wonderful and divine holland taylor. the show was well-written most of the time. tea's nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just didn't support comedy and they still don't. even when they brought in george wendt from cheers, they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters. the show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network botches it up like a bad plastic surgery.
