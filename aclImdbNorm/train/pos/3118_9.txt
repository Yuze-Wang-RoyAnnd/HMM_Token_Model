having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of bourne movies, i was a little reluctant to watch the bourne ultimatum.<br /><br />however it was a very thrilling experience and i didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films. each part of the story was easy to understand and i fell in love with the bourne ultimatum before it had reached the interval! i don't think i have ever watched such an exquisitely made, and gripping film, especially an action film. since i usually shy away from action and thriller type movies, this was such great news to me. ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.<br /><br />matt damon was simply fantastic as his role as jason bourne. i've heard a lot about his great performances in the bourne 1+2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. i look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.<br /><br />the stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and i was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. well done.
