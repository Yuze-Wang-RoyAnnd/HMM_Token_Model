i loved it so much that i bought the dvd and the novel at the same time. the chemistry between the actors (including little arthur) is amazing and thrilling.<br /><br />it could have used a bit more screen time for the yummy frederick lawrence (played by james purefoy). and gilbert markham was amazingly "on it" from the very start of the movie. <br /><br />the one who most thrilled me via surprising shock and awe and wonder was rupert graves as arthur huntingdon. i adore him in forsyte saga, and all else i've seen him in. but he outdoes himself here as arthur. in my wildest dreams i could not have pictured him playing a demented psycho such as arthur huntingdon. but he does. and i love it. and i love him.
