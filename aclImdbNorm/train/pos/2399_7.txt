this was a hit in the south by southwest (sxsw) film festival in austin last year, and features a fine cast headed up by e.r.'s gloria reuben, and a scenery-chewing john glover. though shot on a small budget in nyc, the film looks and sounds fabulous, and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call "the scottish play," as a reference to the word "macbeth" is thought to bring on the play's ancient curse. the acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself, lust, jealousy, rage, suspicion, and a bit of fun as well. the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced (in the lead role) by a well-known "pretty face" from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds. the green-eyed monster takes over from there, and the drama unfolds nicely. fine soundtrack, and good performances all around. the dvd includes director's commentary and some deleted scenes as well.
