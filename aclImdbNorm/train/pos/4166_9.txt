before cujo,there was lucky the devil dog. in 1978,on halloween night the movie"devil dog,the hound of hell" premiered. a story of a family getting a new puppy (from a farmer who just happen to be in the neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables) because their dog skipper was killed.coencidence? everyone loves the new dog,but there is something strange about him. <br /><br />it isn't long until the father mike barry(richard crenna,first blood)starts to notice.his wife betty(yvette mimieux,where the boys are,jackson county jail,snowbeast)is different and his kids charlie and bonnie(ike eisenman,witch mountain and fantastic vourage and kim richards,witch mountain,nanny and the professor,hello larry,tuff-turf)also have changed. does the dog have something to do with it? he's determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family.<br /><br />this movie is great because it has ike and kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we saw on those witch mountain movies. this is one of the many 70's made-for-tv horror movies that was actually scary for a made-for-tv horror movie. the music was creepy and even the ending which i won't tell made you think.<br /><br />this movie also stars ken kercheval(cliff barnes of dallas)and r.g. armstrong(who couldn't stay away from devil movies remember"race with the devil"?)<br /><br />it's worth watching.
