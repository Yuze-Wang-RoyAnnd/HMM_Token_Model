the barbarians maybe's not the best film that anybody of us have seen, but really????........it's so funny......i can't discribe how mutch i laughed when i first saw it..the director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie, but it'sso misirable bad....so bad that it's one of the funniest movies i've ever seen......so my advise is that you should see it.....and if you alredy did, se it again!!!!!!!
