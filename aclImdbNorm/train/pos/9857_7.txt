while i loved this movie, the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high.<br /><br />i own the dvd, so don't get me wrong, i am not saying don't watch it or even buy it! it's just that i still think the first scene was the best, and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it.
