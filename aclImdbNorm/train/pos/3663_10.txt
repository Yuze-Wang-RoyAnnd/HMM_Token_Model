perhaps the last film you would expect to come from vittorio de sica and cesare zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). it's a neorealist fantasy, kind of an oxymoron, really. an old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son. after a few years, the baby is a young boy (named toto) and the adoptive mother is dying. he goes to an orphanage and, when he finally turns 18, he leaves. immediately, he finds that he has no home. toto is optimistic, though, and won't let anything get him down. a man steals his valise, and instead of getting angry over it, toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shantytown. toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless living in the area and they build a better shantytown. soon, the landowner is trying to sell this plot of land, and the citizens of the shantytown have to protect themselves. after many attempts, the owner mounts a force of police to get rid of the homeless. at this point, the film becomes full-fledged fantasy (before this it was more comedic/fantastic melodrama in the style of charlie chaplin). this stuff is so weird and shocking that it's probably best for others to see it for themselves. it's quite amazing, and very funny. there are objections you could raise about the plot of miracle in milan, most certainly. fellini and visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from neorealism. i think i read this was widely criticized at the time of its release. at this point, though, it's so enjoyable - i loved it very much. it might be my favorite of vittorio de sica's films, although umberto d and the bicycle thieves come very, very close. 10/10.
