this show has a great storyline! it's very believable! a mans wife dies and he cant take care of his children alone so he calls on his brother in law his best friend and many others come later on in the show. such as rebeecca donaldson, ,the lovable yet strong dog comet , nikki and alex who you can find out for yourself (i don't want to spoil it for you) and of coerce kimmy gibler! (the sidekick of dj) but the kids are wonderful too. this is mary kate and ashley first took off! and also you may know candace cameron bure from shows like st.elsewere punky brewster and that's so raven! jodie sweetin plays steph the love able middle child who feels left out. really this is a very good show!
