we stumbled upon the documentary, grey gardens, last sunday and got "sucked in" without warning. everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words, "i thrive on it [the smell]." we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in. spellbinding! a must see!!!!
