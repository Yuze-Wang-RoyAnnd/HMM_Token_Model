this is an excellent movie. it is about many things: the hunt for a serial killer, the bureacracy of soviet russia, the drive of one man, and the relationship between this man (the lead detective) and his superior.<br /><br />the thing that sticks with me the most is the relationship between durokov (rea) and fetisov (sutherland) (excuse bad spelling, please!). for some reason, it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense turning into respect and cameraderie and working together. one line in the movie sums it up for me: "he would say something witty, but he is overcome with emotion."<br /><br />excellent acting by all of the cast, even the smallest parts were done with believability.<br /><br />this is not a fast-paced action thriller; in fact, it moves at times like a slow drama, but it is worth it. very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at all.<br /><br />
