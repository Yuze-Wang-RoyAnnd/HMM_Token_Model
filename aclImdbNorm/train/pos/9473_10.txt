i was lucky enough to see this at a pre-screening last night (oct. 20) and i was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt acting.<br /><br />while the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique, and distinctly "indy" in style. it isn't something that can easily be compared to films of the past, it's a unique take on a sort of classic middle-aged depressed love story.<br /><br />i was particularly struck by the casting of the film. down to every last extra in the family, it was a beautiful and talented cast. the three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly dispersed between them and none of them "out-shone" the other two.<br /><br />it was truly a delightful film, appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming. it was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films.
