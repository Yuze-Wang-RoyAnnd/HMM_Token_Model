bedknobs & broomsticks is another one of disney's masterpieces. it was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations. (a similar concept was used in mary poppins when the children and mary disappear into the sidewalk art.) i am mainly rating this film through child's eyes because i have not seen it in years. back then, it was one of my favourite films. it was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict beginning with the ghostly armour walking into battle) were my favourites. there was also a lot of stop-animation used with the spells (ie, people turning into rabbits), which may be a little dated and silly now. (also, i believe that the film starts off slowly.) through the eyes of a child, this is a fun film and it is easy for children to put themselves into the places of the children in the film. it is an imaginative film which is sadly largely-forgotten today.
