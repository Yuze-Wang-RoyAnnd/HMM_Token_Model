i really enjoyed this movie. britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be more appreciated. this movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to discourage and criticize you. holly fulfills her dreams just like britney. <br /><br />there are times in everyones' lives when people judge them for what they are not who they are. watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens. <br /><br />i would like to thank britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. she will never know how much that means to me. bravo britney. you are the greatest!!!
