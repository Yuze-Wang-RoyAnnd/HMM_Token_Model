huge ramones fan. i do like the ramones, and i suppose if you hate them, then, besides being a avid bush supporter, you might not like this classic.<br /><br />it's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80's. infinitely better than the american pie's that plague us now.<br /><br />there are some other great high school films: switchblade sisters, fast times..., class of '84, three o'clock high, and the cheesy yet gripping(doesn't seem possible) river's edge. but rnrhs will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun, plus you can get up and dance with it.<br /><br />i love you, riff randell.<br /><br />10/10
