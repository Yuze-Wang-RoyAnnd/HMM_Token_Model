this movie needs to be put on dvd. it was so funny and i loved it. really, really cute and funny. not realistic, but not suppose to be. the only thing i did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much. it represents the time period way of thinking though. i have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for us format only in the uk and will not play on us dvd players. it is sadly an over looked classic film! believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. lindy is unsinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons. she is funny and charming. she stole the show!
