maybe i need to have my head examined,but i thought this was a pretty good movie.the cg is not too bad.i have seen worse.the look of the creatures(and by creatures i mean the good and the bad snake)was pretty cool.the action scenes involving the snakes was really good,i thought.there are some lapses in logic at times,and the story doesn't always make sense.but for a creature feature,there are a lot worse.a lot of the other creatures seemed lifted from other movies,so it's not wholly original.i think the gist of the story is original though.there is a bit of similarity to godzilla(the big budget american version)which liked a lot.i didn't like this movie as much,but i still say it was pretty good.i also liked the music.all in all,i think dragon wars is about a 7/10
