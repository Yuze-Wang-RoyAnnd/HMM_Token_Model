an excellent film depicting the cross currents in the lives of a multi-ethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural pacific northwest. solid directing and writing along with fine acting, especially the performances by kwami taha and dan stowe. interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the highly successful "crash," written and directed by paul haggis. the pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban los angeles, and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in "apart from that," but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled and their stories as resonant as any of those in "crash." for those viewers who appreciated "crash" this is a must see film. also, fans of jim jarmusch and john cassavetes will like this movie.
