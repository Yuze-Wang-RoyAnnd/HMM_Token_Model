''ranma  1/2 " is my favorite anime by rumiko takahashi. the woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, that is not only a comedy, but also an action anime. the main character of the story is ranma saotome, a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. ranma is engaged to akane because of an arrangement of both fathers, who are great friends and trained together during many years. <br /><br />akane is the younger and most violent sister of the tendo's: kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what.<br /><br />ranma and akane fight all the time,specially because both have a very bad temper, and when they discover that ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda,many new characters and situations starts to happen. they also discover the reason of the transformation: while fighting, ranma and his father fell in a cursed river. but not only them had this kind of fate...<br /><br />if you watched ''ranma 1/2'' and liked, i would recommend you ''inuyasha'' and ''maison ikkoku", two other good creations from rumiko's hands.
