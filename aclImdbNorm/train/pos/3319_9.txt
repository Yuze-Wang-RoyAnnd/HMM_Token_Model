as a long time red sox fan, i just had to go see the movie. it was great! while there can never be enough live footage from the miracle 2004 red sox season, there were great shots of some of my favorite red sox players. while the movie is certainly a chick flick, it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 red sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time. i especially enjoyed the red sox fans that were part of ben's baseball family. the scene where ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious! a must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse, date, or significant other...especially if you are a baseball fan...and even more especially if you are red sox fan!!!
