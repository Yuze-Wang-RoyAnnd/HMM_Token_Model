well, i am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on dvd. when that will happen, i don't know, but i will grab it when it's released.<br /><br />in my humble opinion, this is errol flynn's most entertaining film, especially when "gentleman jim" corbett's ring career begins in the film. then it goes from a good film to a great one.<br /><br />few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that. reportedly, this was flynn's favorite role and i believe that. you can just sense how much fun he was having here. ward bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous john l. sullivan. bond, too, was never better.<br /><br />there is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done, too. corbett's family is fun to watch, too, as they carry on in the stands during jim's matches. out of the arena, corbett's family's constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion.<br /><br />and speaking of the conclusion, sullivan's speech to corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. some mean-spirited critics (variety, for example) didn't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but - duh - most films are fictionalized, like it or not. and, in this case, it made for a nice story and nice ending. (in real life, corbett was a very soft-spoken true gentleman, not anything like flynn's portrayal, but flynn still make him a good guy.)<br /><br />this is one of the more entertaining classic films i have ever watched and i eagerly wait for the dvd.
