i voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish flaws. other than that, this movie is one of my favorites! it's entertaining to say the least. the shooting scenes are ridiculous though, and i think gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little bit too much of his "matrix obsession" into it. it seems like their enemies just stands there...waiting to get shot at. however, this movie is touching and it always makes me cry. it has a lot of great humor in it so it makes me laugh as well. gackt is a superb actor i must say..he shows so much emotion. this was hyde's first time acting and he did okay. the role fits him. wang lee hom is absolutely great. the whole cast is what i would say, perfect for this movie. don't miss it! you'll regret it!
