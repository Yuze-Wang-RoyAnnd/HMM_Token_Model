......... and you get chori chori chupke chupke. don't get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not even) than pretty woman, but it (was) a new topic for bollywood. the topic was accepted but it is far from jism, murder, and julie. to tell you the truth, the topic is presented in a very clean manner. but the plot has it's number of clich'es. the beginning of the movie is presented in a very "filmi" way. there are some very little plot holes. the movie picks up once rani has her miscarriage where you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie. otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning. the acting couldn't have been any better. salman khan sometimes impresses, and sometimes lets you down. over here he gave one of the best performances. on top of that his role is written so well, that you applaud every time he solves a problem. rani mukherjee was adequate. throughout the movie, you feel for her character the most, but she is overshadowed by preity zinta. preity zinta is picture perfect. out of the three, she gives everyone a run for their money. its surprising how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent. and trust me, madhubala is far from your girl next door. this role is one of the reasons why i rate her high. the supporting cast are like the family you see in hahk, where they have no significance to the plot yet i found them tolerable here. the songs are pretty nice. the title song is my favorite of them all along with dil tera mera dil (hearts). mehndi mehndi (henna) and dekhne walon ne (look at the world's sight) are two song that fit the film perfectly. preity's cabaret number, diwani diwani (crazy), could've been shortened while no. 1 punjabi came across boring though it had good dancing. otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch.
