saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing. i'm very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one. it's the often heartbreaking story of a chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both hardship and plenty. but, i must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of hollywood in the 1930s--because peasant life in china was tough to say the least. be prepared to watch segments about famine, death and disease.<br /><br />about the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by paul muni. while he was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a real shame that hollywood always cast people of european descent to play asian leads during this era. if you are paying attention at all, it's pretty obvious that muni is wrong for the part.
