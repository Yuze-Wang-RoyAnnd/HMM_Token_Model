david aames is a rich good-looking guy who lives in new york city. when his 'sleeping partner' julie gianni gets very jealous after david falls for spanish beauty sofia, she gets david into her car and tells him that he's the only guy she loves and wants to be with, but seeing as he's in love with sofia, she decides to commit suicide with david in the car with her, by driving off a bridge. david survives the crash, but is left with a disfigured face. he is then charged with the murder of julie. the thing is, david doesn't know what's real and what's not as he keeps having these strange dreams (most of which are actually nightmares.) and flashbacks, some of which just don't make sense to him. everything will soon come back to him though as he's begins to find out the truth.<br /><br />well, there's an all star cast here, including tom cruise, pen'elope cruz, cameron diaz, kurt russell, jason lee and noah taylor who all give good performances in the movie. in the movie they all put off different things about there characters, like happiness, sadness, angry, etc. really well. there's also a cameo in the movie from the brilliant, steven spielberg.<br /><br />vanilla sky is a well made, different, interesting and original movie which will leave you talking about it a lot after it's finished. it's not just a thriller, but it's a real psychological thriller. the trailer for the movie is really good, but the movie is so different from what it might be made out to be. it's been directed very well and there were a couple of really great scenes here too. all in all, an enjoyable movie which should be really be paid attention too. they are sure making a lot of "are they dead, if not who is dead" movies recently.
