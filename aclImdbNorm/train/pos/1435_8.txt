i appreciate movies like this: smart and well-crafted, entertaining, absorbing, well-acted and nicely directed. nobody -- even pacino -- is chewing the scenery*, trying to stand out; one of the film's most effective moments (aielo pulling over at his beloved off ramp) is chilling precisely because of its restraint.<br /><br />not as good as, say, quiz show, city hall is of a similar cloth: engaging the mind as well as eye, ear, and heart. why such well-hewn entertainment flops at the box office is anybody's guess.<br /><br />*you know, pacino does chew it up in one particular scene, but precisely because it's required. great scene, too.
