are we really making 'video nasties' again? in the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8mm, this is quite a ride. unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a travelogue as our heroine searches the sleaze spots of paris, hamburg and amsterdam. i am however being rather churlish for the 'depraved' scenes, including everything from, hot wax, harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning, beheading and some. these scenes are immaculate and it's a pity bruno and his budget couldn't stretch to make all the many characterful creatures introduced become more than simply caricatures.
