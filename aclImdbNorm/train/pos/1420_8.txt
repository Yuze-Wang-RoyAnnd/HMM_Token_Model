in celebration of earth day disney has released the film "earth". stopping far short of any strident message of gloom and doom, we are treated to some excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves.<br /><br />the stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf. the narrative begins at the north pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics, all the while being introduced to denizens of the various climatic zones traversed.<br /><br />global warming is mentioned in while we view the wanderings of polar bear; note is made of the shrinking sea ice islands in more recent years. we never see the bears catch any seals, but the father's desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution.<br /><br />the aerial shots of caribou migrating across the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shots i ever saw; it and another of migrating wildfowl are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen.<br /><br />one of the disappointments i felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks taking seals were filmed in slow motion. never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animals; their incredible speed. the idea of slowing down the film to convey great quickness i think began with (or at least it's the first i recall seeing) the television show "kung fu" during the early seventies.<br /><br />an interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed. there are enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs. perhaps because of some selective editing (sparing us, as it were, from the grisly end of a prey-predator moment) and the fact that this footage had been released in 2007 and is available on dvd it is a solid film in its own right. and you can take your kids!<br /><br />three stars.
