this is te cartoon that should have won instead of country cousin. visually well-done and much more entertaining and memorable. worth watching just for the music alone! although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days, the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective. it's over sixty years old and it is, after all, just a cartoon. i'm disabled and if i were as hyper-sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage, i would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away. sometimes you need to lighten up, put your head back and float! caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering. bing crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion. *sigh*
