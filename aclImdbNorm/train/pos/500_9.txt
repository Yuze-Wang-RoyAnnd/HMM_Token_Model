i, like many die-hard trekkers (or trekkies, i don't care!) suffered through seven seasons of "star trek voyager", dreaming of a better show when it was over, lamenting the end of "deep space nine" in 1999. prayers, answered. "enterprise" is fantastic. fresh perspective, radically different characters, stunning new visuals, a pop-song for the intro. (i was shocked!) i can't think of anything i didn't like. sign me up for 10 seasons of this show. "star trek" is back - "voyager," nobody misses you! keep on trekkin'!<br /><br />>
