enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny. the vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known "death romances" such as ghost. while we know intuitively that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the joy is in the journey. the moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur. with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, far into the cgi era.<br /><br />yet for all the cosmic scale, powell and pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. the wonderfully, determinedly romantic aspect of "stairway" is captured with ultimate simplicity: june's teardrop, preserved on a rose petal. <br /><br />this film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages.
