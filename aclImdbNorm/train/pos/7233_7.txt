i haven't read through all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be abridged. i'm curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just didn't make much sense to me even when i rewatched them. 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also. "poor little rich girl" which was tourneur's next film is 65 minutes long and "pride of the clan" which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long. so i'm relieved to see that i wasn't crazy, there must be part of this film missing and that's why the resolution didn't make much sense.<br /><br />it's hard to review or comment on a movie that you're only able to see half of... but i would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the insides of an east coast movie studio of the time. it's the earliest film i've personally seen that's based on the movie industry itself. the main character is a movie star played by robert warwick, who was later a mainstay hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of preston sturges' films. he plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on william s. hart, who warwick does resemble somewhat. after the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl (doris kenyon) and convinces her to come to new jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly. after that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have now.<br /><br />again, i'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in film history for the documentary value, but in the form we have it doesn't hold up much as a movie and isn't a particularly good example of maurice tourneur's work.
