such a masterpiece as the first of these two snowy river films was, the sequel to the man from snowy river is everything that a follow-up should be. it does not tread on the toes of its predecessor, preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality.<br /><br />the man from snowy river ii is based upon the return of jim craig to the snowy river country after a three year absence. the film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century, of australian history, legend and horses. the storyline demonstrates a touch of hollywood in lighter shades, an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film, yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of australian patriotism. the plot is far more vibrant than the first film, and much more showy, with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film, yet the man from snowy river ii possesses every essential characteristic of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, a stunning focus of the australian high country, the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed, and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by bruce rowland which equals the first in every way. geoff burrowes has done a superb job with this film, and it is highly worthy of recognition, especially with regard to the quality of the australian film industry. the lead cast, from tom burlinson to sigrid thornton, and a well-replaced brian dennehy, carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film. as far as sequels can go, the man from snowy river ii is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again.
