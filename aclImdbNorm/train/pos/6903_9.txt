this little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites. i can watch it over and over. dreyfus and braga are masterful, but raul julia steals the show! a tongue-in-cheek, menacingly humorous gomez addams, with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft-told story.<br /><br />generally untrumpeted and unappreciated, moon over parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen. two thumbs up!
