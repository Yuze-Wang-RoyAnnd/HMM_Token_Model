hey now, yours truly, theatrex, found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a "cult hit" so of course it came home with me. <br /><br />what a strange film. the aunt and cousin of former first lady jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on long island (suffolk co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. suffolk co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old jackie herself came by to set things right. anyway, this is one strange pair, big edie and little edie...edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings, and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. big edie (the mother, age 79) apparently likes to run around naked, and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that. these women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, except to them. they live in absolute filth, cats doing their business wherever ("look, that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait!"), and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. if i close my eyes and listen to big edie's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt, who was from that area of the country and had that lawn guyland accent. one scene has little edie putting on flea repellent, lovely, you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. the box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and i'd have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for "wacked out of their gourds", but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them. this is equal parts creepy, sad, and disgusting, but i couldn't stop watching once i started. this is not my "normal" type of flick but i found it to be somewhat fascinating. it won't be for everybody though, guaranteed.
