sometimes, lady luck smiles on me. i had originally made -- and copied over -- a vhs tape of this wonderful tv presentation. i was heartbroken when i realized what i had done since i had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else.<br /><br />recently, i subscribed to digital cable, and while searching through upcoming movies, there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie. this time, however, i made a copy of it to dvd so there's no chance of repeating my mistake.<br /><br />i finally got to watch it again after eight years, and it was just as exciting and tense as when i first saw it. there is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with "pandora's clock" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. i just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch, and from the first installment, i was hooked. each day, i waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read.<br /><br />when i learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on tv as a movie, i made sure to clear my schedule for that event.<br /><br />first of all, i'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book, contrary to what another reviewer had said. that, in itself, is a rare achievement for tv movies.<br /><br />secondly, i agree with others about the casting. i could not imagine a better choice for captain holland than richard dean anderson. literally, the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role. anderson has never been better, and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him. in fact, all of the cast members did a superb job.<br /><br />my only complaint with the movie -- and the book -- was the interjection of the "terrorist plot" to arm a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane. basically, we are talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one, and folks, that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved. also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one, then two of its engines blown off.<br /><br />that beef aside, i enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film, as well as our own.<br /><br />if you have an opportunity to see this movie, do so by all means.
