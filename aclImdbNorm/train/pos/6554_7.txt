ok heres what i say: <br /><br />the movie was excellent. i am a huge nancy fan and i have read all 1-56 original books and i went on to read more. i am now on 96. beware of villains giving this movie a lower grade than it should have. all clues point to a wonderful movie! i loved the whole thing. so what nancy is in current time. she is still old fashioned like she is in the books! people who haven't read more than 5 books are complaining about the view of nancy. i have read all of them and i think emma is perfect and that nancy was perfect. i found parts of the movie spooky. i loved the exciting car chases and get aways. i loved the clues. i solved the mystery myself! it was really wonderful. i suggest you go see it since people who have been complaining know nothing of a what a good movie is and b about nancy drew. go see it. it may not be oscar worthy but its really a good movie.
