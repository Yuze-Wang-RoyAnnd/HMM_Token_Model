i gave it a 10, since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to. the reason i'm troubling you is to add a personal observation on castle's work.<br /><br />i've seen "homicidal" and "the tingler" (the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white) a few times and "the house on haunted hill" many times.<br /><br />even i am not old enough to have seen them when castle was up to his showman tricks, thus i can appreciate them for their own merit. and while most pass him off as second-rate, schlocky, hammy, etc., i believe they do him a disservice.<br /><br />the end sequence of "homicidal" is genuinely shocking and works today - and the premise of "the tingler" while silly, was highly original.<br /><br />but "the house on haunted hill" was a triumph. having used that frank lloyd wright house as its exterior, the great vincent price and a solid cast, plus a good score and production values - when i first saw it at a packed late-night showing in the late sixties, it produced an audience reaction i'd not seen before and have not seen since.<br /><br />it was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you've not seen the film, stop reading now) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall.<br /><br />with no telegraphing of what is coming, the camera slowly pulls back, forcing the audience to switch their gaze to... i'm saying no more (my "spoiler" declaration above only covers this movie).<br /><br />the point is, i believe this ploy was deliberate - not accidental - and when it happened, the whole audience screamed (including most of the men!) it took the audience about ten minutes to calm down.<br /><br />now that is superior film-making. a flamboyant showman he might have been, but "house" and the other two films i've mentioned were good movies. castle may not have been a hitchcock, but he was no ed wood, either.<br /><br />it's easy to concentrate on someone's quirks and forget to examine their talent. so i hope this documentary acknowledged that. i look forward to seeing it.
