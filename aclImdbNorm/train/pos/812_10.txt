i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with. in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia, the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister darth vadar. in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen. he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat. return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time.<br /><br />when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse. vadar it seemed had won the day. how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han's daring rescue from jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father's soul.<br /><br />old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself ( played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiud.how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery.) desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadar.all in black with his red eyes,ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold. his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire's reign for good. <br /><br />lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted. we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks ( who i really do not believe take from the movie at all. in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star) and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers. we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all. and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back.<br /><br />but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar. for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings. vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke. never did i think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on vadar's face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke. there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible. he is conflicted. the apprentice as much as the master. the victim as much as the villain. without ruining the end too much vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.<br /><br />so in conclusion what can i say. george lucas is the master of the saga. star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it. return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves. it's action, suspense, romance, tragedy, redemption, joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of.
