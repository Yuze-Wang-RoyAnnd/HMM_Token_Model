this was an adorable movie. a real feel-good movie when you need one. the story is light (this is no gone with the wind) but sometimes, one needs this kind of plot. funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes/wardrobe.<br /><br />parminder k. nagra (also from the tv show er) is wonderful in this role. she is definitely a new shining star for hollywood. all should keep an eye on her, she's going to be big in the future.<br /><br />also impressing was the soundtrack for this movie. a nice mix of modern and indian tunes. i was dancing throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need.
