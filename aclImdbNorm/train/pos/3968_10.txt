i first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on dvd.<br /><br />james stewart brings great depth to the role of chip hardesty, a hardworking and dedicated fbi agent. his life in the bureau is intercut with his family life, which is not all rosy. his wife (an excellent portrayal by vera miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job, and they even separate for a time; chip's best friend and fellow agent sam crandall (murray hamilton) is killed in a gunfight; chip's son, mike, enlists in the marines during world war ii. through it all, the family carries on with bravery and dignity.<br /><br />the action sequences are quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. and the music by max steiner says it all; fidelity, bravery and integrity.<br /><br />this country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the fbi and, yes, to j. edgar hoover as well. if mr. hoover's type of vigilance had been observed, we might have been spared 9/11, the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we've had to put up with since his passing.
