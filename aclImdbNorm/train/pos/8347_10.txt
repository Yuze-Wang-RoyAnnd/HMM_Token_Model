maybe i'm being too generous with the rating...but i just love this movie! i've seen it so many times, but every time i see it i fall in love with it all over again. it's just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing huge or monumentous that happens. but i'm a big romantic and this movie *is* romantic. i love meg ryan and tim robbins, and walter mathau is so funny. the scientists make me laugh so much...i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. it's such a clean, good movie - and those are so rare now! my 20-year-old brother likes this movie, too, so it's not just a chick-flick. ;-) i recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you're just lonely and need to *watch* a romance, if you yourself can't participate in one. it's a good 'un!
