it is an extremely difficult film to watch, particularly as it targets the innermost core of all of our lives. but ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film. any person who finds it cynical i have to say that they must have greatly missed the point of the film's entire message. for those who actually watch the film, they will see that the way the issues are dealt with is absolutely necessary, and the outcome is ultimately uplifting. sure, it's very hard to watch, a difficult subject matter and even brutal. yet it's extremely relevant to society and everybody. it shows the peak of what world cinema is doing at the moment (i will not restrict that term to just france) and everyone should try to see it. i will say that it is best to go in with a clear head without being swayed by conflicting views, and just let the film work for you.
