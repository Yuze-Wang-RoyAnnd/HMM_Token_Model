it seems more than passing strange that such utter dreck as "dukes of hazzard" and "the hills have eyes" (the new version) can find dvd distributors while older - and far superior works such as this film - are nowhere to be found. with all the on-going debate about the morality (or lack thereof) of warfare, and interest in espionage (consider the multiple jack ryan, bourne, xxx, and "mission: impossible" productions, this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on dvd. true, it looks like a 1968 motion picture because it is a 1968 motion picture. but style consideration aside, this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say, and has plenty of plots twists to keep an audience entertained. if nothing else, will somebody please consider getting the soundtrack onto some kind of cd, whether it be a compilation with other morricone music or as a stand-alone. i don't know if industry people bother to read what we fans have to say about their products, but if you are reading this and other comments, please take us seriously. we are paying for your lavish homes with our hard-earned dollars spent on tickets, dvds and cds - give us what we want! all that said, if you are reading this and have not seen this film, lobby for it's release so you may see what those of us who have seen it are talking about. you will not be disappointed.
