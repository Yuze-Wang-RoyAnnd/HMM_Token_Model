there's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship, stuff he dare not dream about.<br /><br />as doctor edward morbius, pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, anne francis. they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell.<br /><br />the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. the machinery they left behind is still functioning.<br /><br />maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion. <br /><br />i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. the terms would change, we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive, courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek.<br /><br />we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship. it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey. it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change.<br /><br />the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one, about mortal beings trying to play god.<br /><br />you can't write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot. this mechanical marvel, put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day. he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space. his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl's request for some home spirits are very funny.<br /><br />robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar, but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea. forbidden planet's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b. demille.<br /><br />classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction. <br /><br />my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who's sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with.<br /><br />never miss this one whenever it's broadcast.
