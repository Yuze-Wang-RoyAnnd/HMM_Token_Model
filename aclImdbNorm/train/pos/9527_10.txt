this is the best mob film ever made. it deserved more then what it got at the oscars. nominated for things like its score, art direction, supporting role (newman), this film could have easily been nominated for best picture, director (mendes), actor (hanks), supporting actor (newman and law) and won!! hanks gives one of his best performances, and the kid who played michel jr. was so good that i'm surprised i don't see him in more movies today. critics themselves didn't give this film enough credit. but besides the incredible performances, another real star of this film is the incredible music. this was by far the best score of the year. it was nominated but didn't win. this is a great film that should be seen by everyone. my grade-a+
