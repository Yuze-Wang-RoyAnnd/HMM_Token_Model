full house is a great family show. however, after watching some episodes over and over again i've realized that they're incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot. yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy. it's not like i hate it, but just don't watch them over and over again because they get old quick. probably the best season is the first.<br /><br />full house is about widower danny tanner(bob saget)and his three daughters d.j. (candace cameron) stephanie (jodie sweetin) and michelle (mary-kate and ashley). when danny's wife dies the he is in need of some help. so, his best friend joey (dave coulier) and the girls' uncle jesse (john stamos) moves in with them. once they live there together they find they can't live without each other. <br /><br />full house reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again.
