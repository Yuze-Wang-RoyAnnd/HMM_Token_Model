i did not read anything about the film before i watched it, by chance, last saturday evening. and then, as i was watching it, i felt the misery of lena and boesman into my bones. i was so captivated by the acting and the tone and the filming that i listened only partially to the dialogues. my husband fell asleep soon after we went to bed and i was sleepless, under the impact of the film. i wanted to wake him up just to say:"if i would ever vote for an oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." i decided to wait until the next day. then i read more about the film on imdb, and was sad to learn that mr. berry died before the release of the film and that he had probably never seen the last version of his brilliant masterpiece. i still want to tell him that to me his film was a true independent film, in its concept and spirit. the actors are to be praised not only for their brilliant performance but for accepting a part with no shine, no showing off, well to the contrary, displaying the true image of human depression. sad but poignant.
