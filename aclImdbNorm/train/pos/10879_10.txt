i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it, which was sometime last year. anyway i got to see today, and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so. i thought that the movie was pretty good. but the thing i didn't like was how the killer was created, i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends: final cut, i almost died it. mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved. cut is 100 times better than ul:final cut. the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes. the killer kicks mo f***ing ass.<br /><br />i give cut a 8 out of 10
