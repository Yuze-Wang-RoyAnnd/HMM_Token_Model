i got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it. it's not the typical romantic comedy. i can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it. the laughs aren't gags here--they're observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of "oh, my god, i thought i was the only one who felt that way!" i won't give away the plot, which is more than just "guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend." the whole family plays a part in the relationship here. probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since "while you were sleeping." <br /><br />steve carell goes much deeper than he's gone before, and for the first time i really liked him. the cast is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom i've loved in other roles, but they blend to make a convincing family. dianne wiest is lovely as the mother, juliette binoche is luminous and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), and even the reviled dane cook gives a warm, quiet, touching performance. the sondre lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition, and i'll buy the cd the second it's available.<br /><br />don't miss this one.
