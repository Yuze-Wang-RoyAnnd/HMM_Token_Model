not many reviews, hence thought i would add one.<br /><br />do not go by the other reviews! this was a excellent movie.<br /><br />rks is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie.<br /><br />ab and akshay given yet another example of great acting, as does bhoomika too, which was a little unexpected, but great to watch.<br /><br />am surprised there has not been much hype around release.<br /><br />or filmfare/other awards nominations, considering how good the movie was.<br /><br />better then khakee i thought and i thought khakkee too was good movie.<br /><br />is a fairly long movie, but definitely worth it and while watching it, definitely does seem long.<br /><br />cant wait for rks next movie and the next ab, akshay movie they always seem to do well together... e.g. waqt.<br /><br />bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future.
