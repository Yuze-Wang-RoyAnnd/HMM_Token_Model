well... vivah is quite a good, but typical sooraj barjatya's movie. it shows different aspects of indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. the movie is more than good, but not extremely good.<br /><br />the big plus point of the movie is direction, music and shahid and amrita's acting (especially the last scene). the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie--- a girl being disliked by her step-mother. story is the movie is a bit common, but it is good, good enough to make the movie a blockbuster.<br /><br />minus point is common story of bollywood movie. overall i would say it is two times must watch movie, if you want to see typical indian family values and of-course love!
