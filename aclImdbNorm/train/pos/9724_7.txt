i love kristen dunst, especially in elizabethtown. i guess she's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera, but just be herself. she did that, and she looked so natural in elizabethtown. in this movie, however, she did try to add in more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, so that she looked more like a sober editor. while in the other half, she totally set herself back in her daily track, and i just couldn't tell her to be an editor any way. therefore, her performance is not enduring in this film. <br /><br />the film,on the whole, is attracting and inspiring. the character of young is full and reasonable. anyway, the film tells a big and sophisticated story. <br /><br />the only big defect is that it didn't show a turning point of the hero and heroine's love story. i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story, because that is rather unclear for the two persons.
