a first time director (bromell) has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged, middle class, depressed hit-man and his struggle with his relationship with his father. this film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. david dorfman as the 6 year old son of william h. macy is the most refreshing little actor i've seen in awhile. macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business. it's always great to see donald sutherland and here he's wonderful as the callous father of macy. the films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast, locations, and filmed the movie. the basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded. the cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background. any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if he's a fan of contradiction.
