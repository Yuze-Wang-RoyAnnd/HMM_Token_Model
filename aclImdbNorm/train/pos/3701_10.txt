the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time. it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently. the kitchen scene starring yvonne and juli ashton is magnificent. the use of the butter and milk really makes the scene. additionally, the doctor's office scene is well done. the campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action, though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. asia carrera's performance in the junkyard scene is incredible, but who would expect anything less from her. the closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films, but is classic none the less. i would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers. run out to your video store and pick it up today.
