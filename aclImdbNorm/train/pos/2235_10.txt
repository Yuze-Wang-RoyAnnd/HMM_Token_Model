i liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the amazon, a part of the world that always has intrigued me. i believe a condensed form of the book was published in "reader's digest" soon after the actual event occurred.<br /><br />because i am a "baby boomer," the character and the actress are my contemporaries, and for this reason i related to the film. i also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the character's following the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where she can get help, as well as other survival techniques. most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude. in conclusion, i hope viewers learn something from it, in addition seeing it for entertainment.<br /><br />i do wish the movie would be released in vhs and dvd soon as i should like to add it to my video collection. it also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels.
