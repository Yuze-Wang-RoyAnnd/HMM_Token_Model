this is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells etc. i will not try to explain it in more details, you will simply have to see it for yourself: you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />i remember watching this as a kid in the 80s (with swedish voices). i have talked with a few people who were also children in the 80s and they loved it also! i must admit that the education-part of the episodes didn't get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of educating children while they have fun is wonderful. i have recently seen a few episodes; there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs nowadays.<br /><br />5/5
