cute film about three lively sisters from switzerland (often seen running about in matching outfits) who want to get their parents back together (seems mom is still carrying the torch for dad) - so they sail off to new york to stop the dad from marrying a blonde gold-digger he calls "precious". dad hasn't seen his daughters in ten years, they (oddly enough) don't seem to mind and think he's wonderful, and meanwhile precious seems to lead a life mainly run by her overbearing mother (alice brady), a woman who just wants to see to it her daughter marries a rich man. the sisters get the idea of pushing precious into the path of a drunken hungarian count, tricking the two gold-digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in europe. but a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good-looking ray milland, who goes along with the scheme 'cause he has a crush on sister kay.<br /><br />this film is enjoyable, light fare. barbara read as kay comes across as sweet and pretty, ray milland looks oh so young and handsome here (though, unfortunately, is given little to do), alice brady is quite good as the scheming mother - but it is deanna durbin, a real charmer and cute as a button playing youngest sister penny, who pretty much steals the show. with absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings several songs throughout the film, though i actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this. the plot in this film is a bit silly, but nevertheless, i found the film to be entertaining and fun.
