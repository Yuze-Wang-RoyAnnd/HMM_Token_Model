this movie of 370 minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies. it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war. it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations, told at list 500 years after those events toke place, around 1100 bc.<br /><br />this is a 1969 movie, so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian, even the close caption is in italian. pity. many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles. but if this is not a problem for you, than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie.
