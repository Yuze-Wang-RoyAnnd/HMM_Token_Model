heh, if i tell you to compare the dark knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9, will you call me crazy? that's just to catch your attention. everyday i meet people complaining there are no good movies, who seem to only know the recent blockbusters. it's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. dick tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated, in terms of technology.<br /><br />the negative reviews mainly complained about dt's "messed up" story. but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear, and i had no problem following it. i didn't see the comic books, yet i am not a huge us comic fan, but i appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances. maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell. but, if you see a movie casting madonna and warren beatty together, what would you expect. i had some scratches on my head, and can't help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? the title role, although not as competent as it sounds, still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences. madonna was more express-less than "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. al pacino was funny and prodigy to himself. apparently he's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles. we can see a hybrid of scarface, michael corleone, adolf hitler and robert de niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh. and many thanks to make-ups.<br /><br />to me it's not bad at all. the surreal feeling really got me.
