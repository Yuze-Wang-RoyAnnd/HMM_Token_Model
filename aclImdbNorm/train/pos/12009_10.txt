i really thought they did an *excellent* job, there was nothing wrong with it at all, i don't know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible, it moved me to tears (i guess it moved about everyone to tears) but i try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing but this one got me. it was sooo good! i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy! i feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that i can't explain, it made me want to strive to be a better person, they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted, i guess. compared to that, i feel like our own trials are nothing. well, not nothing, but they hardly match what they had to go through. i loved it. who played emma?!
