i consider myself a great admirer of david lynch's works, for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical "lynch-elements." having seen most of his works, i naively thought i could predict lynch's next step. i was dead wrong. dumbland is something i could have never imagined under the name of david lynch. still, after my recovery from the first shock, i started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character, and i drew the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality, being emphasized by distorting it. there are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, for they are either disgusting or horrible, however, they are surrounding us, so i take the courage to say, dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces. this is not a movie to enjoy, though you'll sometimes laugh out of a strange, perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. take it as it is, you don't have to like it. it just exists. and finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll find elements typical to lynch as well. i recommend it for tolerant people!!!
