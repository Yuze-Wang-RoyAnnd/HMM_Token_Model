hayao miyazaki name became prominent with spitied away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts. who remembers that spielberg directed duel or george lucas directed thx 1138? i remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation. so when i found a copy in a well known store for lb9 i couldn't resist but buy it. the odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it (memory is funny that way).<br /><br />viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like jean 'moebius' giraud some of the artwork is. i can only assume some influence here.<br /><br />when pazu catches a falling girl (sheeta) his adventure really begins - the quest for laputa - a reference to jonathan swift's overlooked portion of gulliver's travels. with healthy references to jules verne it's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on laputa.<br /><br />this is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree. this is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground.<br /><br />although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals. the ending of the movie silent running is almost exactly the same.<br /><br />it is incredibly stylish, i would not say 'slick' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything.<br /><br />myazaki is a true master of this kind of japnanese anime. buy this movie and treasure it.
