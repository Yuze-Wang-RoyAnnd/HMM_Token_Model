as part of our late 1950s vocabulary, we well knew the ponderosa, little joe, hoss, ben cartwright,etc. on that great show "bonanza."<br /><br />it came saturday night and everyone was glued to the television set. this was a real show depicting family values. there may have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together.<br /><br />lorne greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family. his words depicted wisdom. we often were left to wonder that ben cartwright, a widower, must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died. he reared wonderful sons.<br /><br />naturally, we all wondered why pernell roberts left the show. the show was a gold mine and roberts surrendered loads of money when he departed. his career never took off as he was associated as a cartwright son. he should have tried to get back into the series. he certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out.
