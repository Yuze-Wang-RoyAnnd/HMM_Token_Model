any true wrestling fan would have to consider this wrestlemania to be one of, if not the best of all time. it was packed with excitement and surprises. one of the greatest matches of all time was between shawn michaels and steve austin with special guest ref mike tyson. the show that michaels put on was unbelievable, especially considering the shape that his back was in and that this was his last match.
