i finally saw this film tonight after renting it at blockbuster (vhs). i have to agree that it is wildly original. yes, maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isn't one of those movies. rather, we are treated to the director's eye, his vision of what the story is about. and it does not stop. and to be honest, i didn't want it to. i do believe that sabu had to have influenced the director's of 'lock, stock & two smoking barrels' and 'run, lola, run'. but i absolutely loved the way the three leads see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them momentarily. i really need to see this director's other work because this film really intrigued me. if you want insight, culture, sturm und drang, go somewhere else. if you want a laugh, camera movement and criminal hilarity, look here.
