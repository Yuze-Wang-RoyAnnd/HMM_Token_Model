the narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother. the main character, lin macadam, played by james stewart, represents justice and righteousness. his brother, who operates under the persona of dutch henry brown, played by stephen mcnally, stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father. the world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman wyat earp. <br /><br />present as well are such flat characters typical of the western, such as the murderous indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman, and the bonnet-clad damsel in distress. <br /><br />another important archetype in this film, that which gives the film it's name, is a custom made winchester rifle. the weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably. once it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it. in this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in raiders of the lost ark, and the blood stained letter in saving private ryan. this gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /><br />being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as jack arnold's no name on the bullet, and clint eastwood's unforgiven. <br /><br />there is also a tacit theme of rape in winchester '73. waco johnny dean, one of the film's villains played very effectively by dan duryea, abducts a woman after killing her husband. the volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband, and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off. waco johnny dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous winchester rifle. <br /><br />the main story of winchester '73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of jason and his quest for the golden fleece, as told in apollonius' argonautica. both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality. like jason, stewart's character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one-of-a- kind prize. another theme in winchester '73 that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers. several stories of antiquity deal with this issue, such as the hebrew bible's tale of cain and abel, and the vulgate tale of romulus and remus. <br /><br />as for the theme of abduction and rape present in anthony mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of europa as told by ovid in his metamorphoses. <br /><br />winchester '73 is a fine example of the western genre, and acts as the objective correlative for many classic american western and ancient mythological themes.
