i just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the canadian broadcasting corporation's 'passionate eye' series. it has been screened recently (sept. 2003) at the toronto international film festival as well as many others. it is a quite remarkable film. the filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about chavez himself. instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. they had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. they, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. as a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, i think, the way it should be. what we get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be. what we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy... a charismatic leader (chavez) who actually cares for his people... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.<br /><br />
