obviously, there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production. but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot. i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other (great) chinese films. i first saw this when i was 14 years old, i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything...
