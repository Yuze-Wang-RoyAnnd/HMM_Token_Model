cary grant, douglas fairbanks jr. and victor mclaglen are three soldiers in 19th century india who, with the help of a water boy (sam jaffe) rid the area of the murderous thuggee cult. the chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most entertaining movies of all time. sam jaffe is exceptional as the outcast water boy who is mistreated by all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem. a must see by anyone who enjoys this type of movie.
