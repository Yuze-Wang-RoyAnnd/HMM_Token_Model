i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema, made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. it is filled with super-surfer greg noll's home movies, and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. nevertheless, it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory. it is filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic. surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots. nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or ph.d's(again, perhaps). it believes in the quest of the surfer. it believes in the beauty of human goofiness. it believes in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before. it celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the russian socialists. surfing is the ultimate narcissism. it is dangerous, but only slightly historical. i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. he had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. this movie has no military heroes. it has no guns. the only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop. this is not a problem. peace is not desperate. it is the joy of exhalation.
