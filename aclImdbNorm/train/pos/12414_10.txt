renny harlin's first american film was one of the best of a slew of prison-set horror films(like "death house" or "the chair")in the late 80's.twenty years before,guard lane smith had wrongfully executed a condemned man.now,he is the warden of the newly re-opened prison,and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge.this atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence.viggo mortensen,tiny lister,tom everett and kane hodder are onhand for the entertaining carnage.
