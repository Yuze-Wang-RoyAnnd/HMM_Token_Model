this movie is gorgeous. it's real and down to heart, but at the same time totally crazy. the characters are easy to fall in love with, because they have so many different minds, but each of us could refer to at least on. in canada, we don't have many movies from eastern europe, and for the few i have seen, loners is one of the best. it's very funny, and magic. if you want to see something new and refreshing, go see loners.
