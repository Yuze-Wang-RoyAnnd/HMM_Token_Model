i must give how she move a near-perfect rating because the content is truly great. as a previous reviewer commented, i have no idea how this film has found itself in imdbs bottom 100 list! that's absolutely ridiculous! other films--particular those that share the dance theme--can't hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top-notch, believable acting, and amazing dance routines.<br /><br />from start to finish the underlying story (this is not just about winning a competition) is very easy to delve into, and surprisingly realistic. none of the main characters in this are 2-dimensional by any means and, by the end of the film, it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them. (and, even if you're not the crying type, you might get a little weepy-eyed before the credits roll.) <br /><br />i definitely recommend this film to dance-lovers and, even more so, to those who can appreciate a poignant and well-acted storyline. how she move isn't perfect of course (what film is?), but it's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half-baked plot and/or characters who lack substance. the actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers!
