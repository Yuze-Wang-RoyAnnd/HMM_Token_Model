david burton(richard chamberlain, quite good)is a lawyer, more adept at handling corporate taxation(..and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness), who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy..we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlie(nandjiwarra amagula)uses a "death bone" to stop his heart. meanwhile, revolving around david, bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock-sized hail during bright blue skies(with no sights of clouds, such as the one that hits a school in central australia), not to mention, a "deformed" rainbow which is split(!)into groups. as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize. one aboriginal named chris(david gulpilil)appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial! he finds that it's quite possible, after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris, that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come.<br /><br />absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it's story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. with peter weir in charge, the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization, but the film's most compelling angle is certainly david's journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly, at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn't commit, and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later.
