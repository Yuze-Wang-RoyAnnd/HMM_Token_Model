giallo fans, seek out this rare film. it is well written, and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films. i don't want to give anything away, so i wont even say anything about the plot. the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect. recommended! the only place i've seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema, for $15.
