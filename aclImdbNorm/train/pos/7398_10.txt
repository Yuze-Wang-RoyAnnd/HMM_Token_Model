xizao is a rare little movie. it is simple and undemanding, and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy. the story is simple, and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes. this theme is the essence of the movie, but it would have fallen flat if it wasn't for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying them.<br /><br />the aging patriarch, master liu, is a relic of china's pre-expansion days. he runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood. every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jelaousy for us stressed out, unhappy people. not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful setting.<br /><br />master liu's mentally handicapped son er ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie, coupled with his modern-life brother. the interactions between these three people, and the various visitors to the bath house, are amazingly detailed and heart-felt, with some scenes packing so much emotion it's beyond almost everything seen in movies.<br /><br />with its regime-critical message, this movie was not only censored, but also given unreasonably small coverage. it could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find, even on the internet(!), you can't help getting suspicious.<br /><br />so help free speech and the movie world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you happen to own the dvd, if there even is one, then share share share!
