i actually quite enjoyed this show. even as a youngster i was interested in all sports and that included horse racing. it was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record filming about this controversial subject. one episode i particularly remember centred around a horse expected to win a big race that looked a bit off colour. a syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood tests. all too late they realised the horse hadnt been doped but had had its knee cartilage removed. like running a car with no oil and the engine seizing up, the horse broke down with tragic consequences.
