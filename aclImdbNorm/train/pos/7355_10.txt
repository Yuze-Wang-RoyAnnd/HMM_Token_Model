for a low budget project, the film was a success. the story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. eva longoria, who now stars on the tv show "dragnet," is sexier than ever. the locations were ideal for the ganster plot, and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project. of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. although this film has it's share of problems, such as continuity, i must say that i would rent the director's next movie. if your a film student, you could learn a few things from the director's commentary.
