as drunken millionaire playboy arthur bach, dudley moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood. as it turned out, the role fit moore so perfectly, it trapped him as an actor as well. many disappointments soon followed (including this film's pale sequel), yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture, which is cleverly written and directed. some of moore's drunk scenes are forced, parts of the film are wobbly, but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist. it has a very big heart and gives oscar-winner john gielgud a sly, dryly amusing role as arthur's valet, hobson; his relationship with arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport. liza minnelli (as a blue-collar love-interest) is sassy in a low-key and moore is brash, but deft and lively; he never shook off the shadow of arthur, but at least we have this document of a career high-point to cherish. *** from ****
