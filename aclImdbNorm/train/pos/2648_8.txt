really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace (via drug addiction) and later redemption. one brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by james franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent man-child. the other brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his family's expectations for both children. not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be, and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about. i'd recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend james franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love.
