e! tv is a great channel and talk soup is so funny,in a flash you can view the episodes change. we want more funny writings by the best writer ever stan evans.. the patron saint of the mindless masses... he is a truly talented, gifted writer, actor, comic, producer,director, and creative consultant.anna nicole loved him , but he was not a $$$$billionaire so he left him for a billionaire. many super stars wanted to make films with the actor stan evans, who has a "humphrey bogart" {clark gable}acting style. he should make many more movies. maybe with stephen spielberg, or perhaps many other talented producers.we wish him a moment of fame with a great fortune to gain. has he produced any mock-u-dramas? or perhaps any docudrama??? a project about bernie madhoff would be a great tv movie written by stan evans. how many screenplays has he written?? is he under $$$$$$$$$$$$billion contract with disney?? he should earn more than $50 million... he could also write a tv movie about the late king of pop.. michael jackson. we want to view a lot more of and by stan evans in the movies and on tv. thank you so very much. elvis has left the building!!!!!
