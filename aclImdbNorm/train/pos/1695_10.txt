normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles. but here is a sci-fi comedy quoting the war of the worlds broadcast.... and it is gold! the very concept of a small bunch of diminutive,aggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent. don't be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids' movie it is unsophisticated - it isn't, there's a lot of hidden treasure... a gem!
