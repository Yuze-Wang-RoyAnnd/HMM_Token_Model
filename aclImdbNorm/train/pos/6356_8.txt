i thought how the grinch stole christmas was a pretty good movie.it wasn't horrible, nor was it great, but it was enjoyable to watch.i felt as if jim carrey got a little annoying at times.they made the grinch seem like a special education person, when all he needed to be was evil and devious, but yet he turned out kind of retarded.i did think the scenery, when not inside the grinch's cave, was beautiful, and there was a few parts where i laughed, but most of the time i thought it was just annoying.this movie could've been "so" much better if they had changed the grinch's personality, and they had included some more laugh scenes, because most of the humor wasn't funny.i liked how the grinch stole christmas anyway, but it's not anything to get excited about seeing.
