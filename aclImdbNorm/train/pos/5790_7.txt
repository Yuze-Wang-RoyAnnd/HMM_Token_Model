wow! all i can say is that if elizabeth montgomery is the enemy (she speaks russian), then i'm surrendering right now. in her short skirt, high-top boots, and pronounced bust line, she's a real babe, even if her zombie-like eye-shadow sort of comes and goes. this 30 minutes is no doubt the sexiest of the series. note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with bronson until he ungallantly slugs her on the chin, ruining all the fun. okay, probably i should leave off my hormonal response.<br /><br />this is a very well produced half-hour by that underrated force behind the series's success, buck houghton. naturally, the producers want to lead off the third season with an above average entry. it's post nuclear-holocaust america (we know because she's part of the invading force) and only american bronson and soviet montgomery are left, along with about twenty tons of realistic wreckage. they wander among the destruction in alternating moods, while we wonder how long it will take for biology to trump politics, which of course it eventually does, (lucky bronson). and that's about it. no real talk, except for what bronson has to say which is pretty overblown. nonetheless, the screenplay is still entertaining, and rather daring for its time, even suggesting that not all russian women looked like truck drivers (a popular cold war stereotype of the time).<br /><br />in passing-- it's rather curious that the very slavic-looking bronson (buchinsky) would be cast as the american and the glossy-looking montgomery as the slav. appearance-wise, it should be the reverse. my guess is that the producers did not want to cast the american in the physically weaker role of the female, regardless of appearances. however that may be, there is little of the usual tz fright or atmosphere, still the episode remains a very, very watchable 30 minutes.
