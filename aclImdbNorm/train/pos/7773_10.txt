fabulous film! rented the dvd recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work. douglas sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of rock hudson, dorothy malone (oscar winner), robert stack (oscar nominated), and lauren bacall that words cannot describe. paul verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having dorothy malone play sharon stone's murdering inspirational guru in his basic instinct. what a great joke!<br /><br /> by turns the film is hilarious, riveting, campy, biting, trashy, compelling, and eye rolling! it's definately the grandaddy of every tawdry big-and-little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like you'll see here: the camera work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable, the one dimensional characters are unforgettable, and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut!<br /><br /> while most older, highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through, written on the wind contains so much and goes by so fast that it's actually a shame when it ends. thank you to mr. sirk for crafting -and todd haynes for drawing attention to- what has now become one of my favorite films of all time! see this movie!!!
