i tuned into this by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted. i'm a professional actor and i was flabbergasted by the performances. they felt totally improvisatory, absolutely without affectation. i could not tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited until the very end to see credits and then spent a half an hour on the imdb to find this film. do not miss it. i see that the writer-director also did a very fine film called everyday people which i enjoyed a lot. the shame of the film business is that projects this excellent do not get the distribution and advertising that they deserve and live under the radar. this film deserves to be flown high and proudly. i urge people to look it up and watch it.
