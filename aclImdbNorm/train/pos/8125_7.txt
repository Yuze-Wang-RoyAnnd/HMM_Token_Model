things to come is that rarity of rarities, a film about ideas. many films present a vision of the future, but few attempt to show us how that future came about. the first part of the film, when war comes to everytown, is short but powerful. (ironically, film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking england--appeasement was at its height. wells' prediction was borne out all too soon.) the montage of endless war that follows, while marred by sub-par model work, is most effective. the explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of german expressionist graphic design. the art director was the great william cameron menzies, and his sets of the ruins of everytown are among his best work. margaretta scott is very seductive as the chief's mistress. the everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design. the acting in the 21st century story is not compelling--perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970. unfortunately, the model work, representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways, is laughably bad and could have been done much better, even with 30s technology. this is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing. this is redeemed by raymond massey's magnificent speech that concludes the film--rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well. massey's final question is more relevant now than ever, in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight. the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss, whose last name i proudly share.<br /><br />unfortunately, the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038. i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film.
