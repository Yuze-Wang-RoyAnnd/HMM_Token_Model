spirit: stallion of the cimarron is an overall wonderful movie. the blending of animation types is unique, the storyline is amazing, and the music is wonderful.<br /><br />the drawn animation is a special thing about many animations. how they expressed the characters, especially the horses, through their animation are spectacular especially. while the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who haven't studied horses might not understand. without words, i would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features. because of this, i understand the 'eyebrow' they added to the horses (while real horses don't have those thick lines). one of the few things i noticed about horse habits that might have been portrayed strangely is that spirit lead his mother's herd. in wild horse herds, the lead stallion usually chases the young colts out.<br /><br />also, while some people might think portraying the white army officers as the 'bad guys' is stereotyping, think of all the movies in which the native americans have been portrayed as that. sometimes back then; they did treat mustangs very poorly. for example, in real history, the appaloosa breed was almost wiped out due to the army officers. imagine what would have happened to one of the worlds best loved riding breeds if the native americans had not saved them.<br /><br />i think it's amazing how the realism wasn't subtracted by making the horses talk to each other. spirit's feelings were expressed by a little bit of narration, but mostly through the music (by bryan adams). the songs express the story really well, and hans zimmer and bryan adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics.<br /><br />the emotion i got when watching the movie, whether the first time or the twentieth (yes, i've watched it that much), you wouldn't believe. some of the scenes take your breath away, while others seem to force tears into your eyes. the opening sequence, showing spirit's homeland, puts you right into the spectacular action right away.<br /><br />i don't understand at all why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie. overall, i rate it a 10/10 - a must watch.
