a very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of gm's flint, michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of japanese automakers in the us. set in western pennsylvania, it features great performances by michael keaton, gedde watanabe, and george wendt. music by blues legend stevie ray vaughan.
