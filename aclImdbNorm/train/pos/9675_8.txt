most folks might say that if one were to spend a saturday night watching a movie,you must be really bored. actually,i had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the tv and there it was,"paulie". <br /><br />i had missed the opening credits,so i didn't know the name of it but i saw that it had cheech marin in it,so i naturally thought i had tuned into "born in east l.a." when i saw him talking to a talking parrot,i was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night.<br /><br />happy to say,it was better than that. as you know,if you don't already paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner. seems it's taken years to find her. what should be paulie's advantage is actually a dis-advantage in ways. people come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves. <br /><br />while cheech marin's character "is" making money from him,he's not mean to him. the dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute,i found them amusing.<br /><br />paulie,who's naive',learns quickly that not all humans are nice people. especially the owner of an animal research lab. the man lies to him saying he'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research. paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of paulie's vocal ability.<br /><br />throughout the film paulie's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him,several other animals and finding the location of paulie's owner. it's a touching reunion. <br /><br />8 out of 10,the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown. that part might bother younger children. otherwise,it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart.
