i was really surprised with this movie. going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i'd seen, i thought it was going to be a dude where's my car kind of crap fest. i was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. instead i got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.<br /><br />yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boys. all the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.<br /><br />i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and i was very surprised. yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very smartly done.<br /><br />in the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not?
