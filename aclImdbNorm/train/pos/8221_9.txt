sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don't really degrade in quality from one film to the next. thus, sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan. this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation. harry's always on the job it seems. clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate, and without fear. as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the 80's, sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70's feel that characterizes the first three films. this doesn't mean that it's quality is any less. bottom line: brimming with intensity and action, sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series.
