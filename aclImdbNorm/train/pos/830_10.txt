i didn't have many expectation going into the film, but i thought it was fantastic. pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role. he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor. pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great, and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time. the humor is dark, the performances by brosnan, kinnear, and hope davis are great, mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship, and you have a great film. this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time. this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-bond era of brosnan's career.
