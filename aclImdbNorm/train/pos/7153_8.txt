my wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story, having read it to several of her classes. it never sounded all that interesting to me, though, and i bought the dvd figuring this would be a movie that wouldn't really be up my alley.<br /><br />the first half of the movie has a lot of set-up and i found myself thinking that i was right. it starts off a bit slow and i have to admit that i was a little bit bored - but curious enough to stay with it. boy, am i glad i did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie. i would most certainly watch this again!<br /><br />the casting was very good. since i haven't read the book, i can't vouch for accuracy, but i have to say that jon voight was truly delightful. you liked the characters you were supposed to like, hated the ones you were supposed to hate, and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funny.<br /><br />i can see how some folks might not like this movie. it is tedious at times, especially in the beginning. all the flashbacks can be distracting (though they are essential to the story). once the story starts to come together at the end, though, i think you're paid back in spades for your patience. when all is said and done, i think this is a very good movie - 8/10.<br /><br />
