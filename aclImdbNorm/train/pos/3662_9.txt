this is a really strange film--and that is not a bad thing. it is a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless and a fairy tale. i'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange, but i loved it. once again, this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people (not actors) and gets a great ensemble-type performance. although not nearly as sad as umberto d, both movies have a very similar point to make--this one just does it in a very absurdist way. ignore the cheesy special effects--after all, it was made in the early 1950s and special effects aren't terribly important anyway (or at least they shouldn't be in films). instead, just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride. unless you are a total curmudgeon, you'll have a ball.<br /><br />by the way, since i first reviewed this film, i have seen another desica directed film that is an absolute must-see and that is the children are watching us. while not a fantasy or light in spirit like miracle in milan, a great film nevertheless.
