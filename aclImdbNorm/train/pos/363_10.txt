this movie is about development. people growing and people fading, people surprising and people disappointing. it has it all and more. there is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut role.<br /><br />this movie made me feel very human and proud of it, and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion. rating: 10 of 10.<br /><br />ps: i admit it: i shed a tear of joy during the final scene.
