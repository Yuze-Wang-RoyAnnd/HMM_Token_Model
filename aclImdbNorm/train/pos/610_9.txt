although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it is certainly not. when i saw the movie, i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. and i was right. <br /><br />stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film. it has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie. the storyline is well written , and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. like every tale , it has some short of morality. therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. we also know that the true love is yvaine and not victoria , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative. <br /><br />i have to give extra credits to claire danes. she literally shines in this movie. her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character. moreover, she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable. the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movie<br /><br />overall , the movie is fantastic, the locations magical and the plot interesting.i was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards. i have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
