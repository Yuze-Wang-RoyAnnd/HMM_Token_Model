finally i got to see the infamous "ice age". apart from maybe not being as dead funny as i'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word i can say about it. sure, it's not as glamorous as a disney production(besides, it is fox's 1st attempt at a full length cg movie) but it's got immense heart and on some occasions(like the look in manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past) i found myself on the verge of tears. but when they reunited the baby with its father i just couldn't hold them in anymore. a movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and clich'e and manages to bring more than the best out of it; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations i have ever seen. great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you(and great voice talents as well) and many funny memorable scenes, especially from scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go. plus the dodo scene, which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002.<br /><br />i honestly don't get it, but for some reason it really looks like cg animation will be taking the upper hand in the future. but if it just means that there will be more movies like this one (and who can forget pixar's creations) then i don't really mind, at least for now. 9/10
