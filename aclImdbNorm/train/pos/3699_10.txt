"who loves the sun" works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging, but often hilarious. it's been a while since i've found such a thoroughly touching, thoroughly enjoyable film. <br /><br />the film is gorgeous, drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes. the peaceful imagery contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human, very flawed, and yet very likable characters. due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. <br /><br />i recommend "who loves the sun." it's a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other, and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness.
