c'mon people, look at the title! lol! i remember seeing this movie on saturday late night creature features years ago. it's a great, cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic hillbillies that add to the schlock factor. the 2 redneck boat rental guys are the movie! lol, and you'll love the boat scene where the english guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and it's midday and sunny. bloody hilarious!!! you can tell they just didn't care about plot, they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible. bottom line, you'll love it if you love 70's schlock.
