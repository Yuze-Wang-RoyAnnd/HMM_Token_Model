a lot is dated in this episode (just like most twilight zone episodes), such as the woman's incredibly sexist military "uniform." and some things are so unbelievable, like the easy availability of clean water. still, consider the year this was made and the time, and you quickly understand why this episode is so special as you watch. it has a nice sense of hope, something missing from a lot of twilight zones, as well as an interesting female character (despite the fact that she rarely speaks), something else rare on the twilight zone. "two" is a great example of how the twilight zone, in just over 20 minutes, could pack more emotion and drama than most two hours movies today. and it's great to see two people who became american icons so early in their careers.
