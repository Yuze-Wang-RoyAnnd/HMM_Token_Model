of all the versions of the odyssey (or of any greek mythological story for that matter), this in my opinion is the best of them all. almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, e.g. the absence of scylla & charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece,not some hollywoodish sword-and-sandal b-flick. notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian, if one is familiar with the storyline, he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand). at least i did, and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more.
