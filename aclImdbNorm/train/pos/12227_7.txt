i searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging "clueless" (1995), perhaps alicia silverstone's best known effort from early in her film career. "true crime" has kevin dillon, which should be helpful in improving most film projects. in fact everyone in the cast does a good job . the only disappointment i think the movie has for me is an awkward "feel" to some of the scenes, coming from the need to run a quite uncompromising, grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a schoolgirl adventure.<br /><br />alicia silverstone is pretty good in this one. she carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease that affects mary giordano as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murders. i reckon her characterization of mg has some mileage in it too. the inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement. it could be really interesting for an older silverstone to revisit giordano at a time of crisis later in the officer's life. just a thought!<br /><br />"true crime" shows its director in a good light. pat verducci also has the writing credit. i don't know of any other film work pv has done. i can only wonder what happened after such a promising start.<br /><br />like most productions, this one has a largely unknown supporting cast, although bill nunn (detective jerry guinn) is hardly that. over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances. i recall seeing him recently in "carriers" (1998), a made for tv presentation with a military theme. bill nunn played "captain arends". fans of the classic us tv comedy show "who's the boss" may also have an interest in "carriers" because the leading player is judith light, remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the show.<br /><br />"true crime" could easily not have worked, but it does ok. i think it is an entertaining story worth seeing.
