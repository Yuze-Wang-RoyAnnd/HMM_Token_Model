<br /><br />film dominated by raven-haired barbara steele, it was seen when i was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle, seeking blood. steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty, and the views of the walking dead pre-date romero's night of the living dead shamblers, unifying them in my mind.<br /><br />i don't see the connection between this film and the haunting, which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present. la danza macabre is a b-movie without pretention, daring you to fall in love with barbara steele and suffer the consequences. there's no such draw to haunting's overwrought claire bloom. the comparisons to the haunting are superficial.<br /><br />and no, this movie does not need to be remade. not only is it a product of the sixties, but the large percentage of talentless cretins in hollywood cannot fathom macabre's formula for terror. that formula is based on one overriding factor: good writing. low-grade classics like castle and corman's poe films with r. matheson and tourneur's out of the past share a commonality of strong writing. it's simple. get a real writer like richard matheson or steve mcquarrie and let them put a plot into today's cinematic mess. besides that, let hollywood attempt some original material for a change, and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past.
