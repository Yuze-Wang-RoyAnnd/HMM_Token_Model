i watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue. and when i watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh. i think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film. however watching it now i can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was. but i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on vhs on my fist tv that would cloud the image in yellow. and and bearing in mind it is a children's film, that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10.
