this is an extremely long movie, which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting, but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies.<br /><br />if you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart-wrenching, because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak. if you can love a monster you'll cry for magnus pym, the spy who betrays everyone - notably his country, his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people.<br /><br />there isn't one truly likeable character in the entire story, not one loyal, 'moral' personality to sympathise with. but watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable.<br /><br />i really enjoyed it in the end. well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character.
