standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points. number one, lonette mckee as sister who gives a stunning, star making performance. the fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me. sadly, she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on irena carter's bland character, sparkle, whose rise to fame is easy, boring, and unconvincing. however, whenever the girls go on stage and perform, the movie comes back to life. the original music by curis mayfield must be praised. the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape. the picture quality was pretty low, as well as the production values i'm guessing. all in all, its worth a gander.
