11 oscar nominations and zero win!!! am yet to understand why - its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington - whoopi, oprah, margaret avery, danny glover etc- were all amazing - i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year...... it should go into the shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges.... <br /><br />its an amazing book - but true to alice walker's style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters - so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out. <br /><br />the cinematography was amazing - the african scenes live much to be desired - the african part in the book is supposed to be set in liberia - somewhere in west africa - but oh no! steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of africa outside of the safaris - so yes there had to be a complimentary zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none west africa ---- and most of all why get the people to speak swahili --- who in west africa speaks swahili?? i just had to get that out of the way.......<br /><br />but as a story - amazing, film-making - out of this world - classic yes!!<br /><br />i own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.
