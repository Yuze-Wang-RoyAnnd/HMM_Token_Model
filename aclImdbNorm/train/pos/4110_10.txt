this, and "hidden fortress" are the kurosawa's that are most dear to me. i don't hand out 10's like candy, but this certainly deserved it, if anything. even though it's quite long (like all kurosawa's pretty much are) it concurred the problem which bugs me with most of his films; the storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving, containing scenes that are unnecessary or just lenghtened too much without any real purpose to the storyline or the character description. dodesukaden delivered to me the same experience that for example "hidden fortress" did; despite its lenght, there wasn't a single minute i would cut out.<br /><br />this is also a very unusual kurosawa film in a way, it has no storyline, but many little independent stories which are based more to the character description than storyline, unlike any other kurosawa-film i have seen so far. it also leans much on the dialogue, which he uses brilliantly (especially in the story between the father and the son planning their "new house"). <br /><br />still the thing that makes this one a masterpiece is how the subject being so tragic as it is, is managed to be described so humanely and sympathetically, without pointing fingers at anybody at any point. from the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
