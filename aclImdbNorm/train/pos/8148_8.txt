i have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture, i'm white and like classic rock, however, that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. its pretty much a sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie, just about rap instead or rock. yet it's hilarious. there are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat. the characters are all very funny and believable. i watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a.m., and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening. one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different. rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent. this movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit. overall, it's a funny movie with many jokes about racism, sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor. this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap. they are essentially the same movie, just about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.
