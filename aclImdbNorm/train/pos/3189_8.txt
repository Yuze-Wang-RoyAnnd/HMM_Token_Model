this is one of the best ensemble comedy/musical "b" film's that i have seen (and since i'm in my 40's now and only seeing this now, i am not an expert but i have seen all the well known films out there). when there are a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time, usually the comedy interferes with the musical bits, and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comedic flow. call me in a crazy kind of mood but when i saw this on tcm europe, i was laughing out loud with pleasure! so who delivered the laughs for me? without a doubt mischa auer delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs, he even steals the ending, it was great! speaking of which, i think why this movie works is because although l & h are a selling point (and why i got hooked to watch this one (them and hal roach), i love them in their early hal roach stuff), this keeps them at a minimum and stays squarely on adult fare (by 1930's standards, and not that far from today's standards if you read between the lines). jack haley is also great to watch, i admit that i only know him from w o oz and i loved him there, and i also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show. patsy kelly is the only "ugly" femme in the 30's movies that actually turns me on (something tells me she was a spitfire in real life); and the musical numbers have a real professional production (busby berkley'ish) quality, that blew me away from what i am used to in this genre. i could go on and on, but rest assured i really enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 i saw it on tcm europe and will record it to watch again with my wife on tcm usa. good stuff!
