jean-jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. here the idea is treated literally. both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. this discovery may well hold true in france; at any rate, it's quite romantic.
