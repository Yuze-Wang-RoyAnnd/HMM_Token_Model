after fatih akins first work "im juli", which was fairly good, he created a really gorgeous italian family epic. its a german movie, which is unfortunately a bad precondition, cause we rareley produce more than moderate movies ;). but this movie makes some very good snapshots of the time then. "solino" is about a italian immigrant who arrives in the "ruhr" region of germany during the 60s. the immigrant and his family then start the first pizza restaurant in the region. the characters are excellent drawn. especially gigi, the main actor. you live every second, every feeling he does. his brother, played by moritz bleibtreu, isnt that good. well, you just dont believe him the role. but the character is wellbalanced and fits perfectly into this script. i feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of "the godfather". many people will probably hate this movie, say its boring. not much tension? - yes, but an outrageous movie. 9 out of 10.
