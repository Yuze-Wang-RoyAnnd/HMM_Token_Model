okay, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but i've voted for "10" to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo's who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews. each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers... three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big-time hollywood productions. performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive, with notable turns by bill paxton, james karen, vivian schilling and brion james. martin kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe-lamp, and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim. but overall, it's got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments. definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!
