in this send-up of horror films, 50's cold war paranoia, reagan-era america, and high school films, adam arkin plays tony, the star quarterback of full moon high in the 1950's. he and his father (ed mcmahon) travel to communist romania and while he's lost in the streets one night, he is bitten by a werewolf. when he returns stateside, he cannot control his animalistic urges and goes on a killing spree. frustrated, he flees town. decades later, the immortal tony returns to town and re-enrolls in highschool. he still can't control his transformations, and the townspeople, and his friends, realize he's not quite human. it all culminates during the schools big football game.<br /><br />i expected this to be one of those 'so bad it's good' films from the early 80's. but i was surprised that the film was actually, legitimately funny. the cast, including kenneth mars as a pervy coach, roz kelly as tony's lusty former flame, demond wilson as a bus driver, and alan arkin as a oddball doctor, go all out, with hilarious results.<br /><br />while watching this film i was struck by how similar the writing and humor were to 'family guy.' 'full moon high' has that same anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously.
