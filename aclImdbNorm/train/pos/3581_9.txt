i had seen this film way back in the 80's and had nearly forgotten it when i noticed it was on tv again and watched it. i remembered having liked this little sleeper when i first saw it, and i liked it even better on second viewing.<br /><br />all of the actors, especially robert duvall, glenn close, wilfred brimley, frederic forrest, and jason presson (as the twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting death of his older brother), are superb. the film has a very genuine feel to it--an understated, quiet, deeply moving story of a family aching with grief. the dialogue is sparse but telling, and the nonverbal acting is outstanding. sort of like a simpler, rural version of ordinary people sans psychiatrist but equally impressive family dynamics.<br /><br />the stone boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it.
