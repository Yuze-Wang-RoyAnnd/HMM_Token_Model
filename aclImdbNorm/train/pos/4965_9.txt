of all the football films i have watched, this is one of the 2 best. the other being fever pitch. but hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, diego maradona. this story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.<br /><br />the musical score is evocative and the images are powerful. the narration by michael caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic. this story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself.<br /><br />exciting games like france v brazil( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. the final argentin v w germany was also in the same vein. highly recommended. a classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, esp if you're a maradona fan.
