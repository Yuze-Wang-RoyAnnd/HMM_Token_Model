how i got into it: when i started watching this series on cartoon network,i have to say that i've never seen anything like this,and it was the best. but when i started collecting the series on vhs,and years later on dvd part of bandai's anime legends collections. it was amazing,and truly worth watching. it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat. and of course,the theme songs "just communication",and rhythm emotions" were the best.<br /><br />characters,and gundams: my favorite characters in the show were:heero,duo,relena,treize,lady und,noin,and zechs. my favorite gundams in the show that i liked the most are the wing zero,and epyon,and of course the altron,and deathscythe i,and ii.<br /><br />meaning of the show: what this series also tells us that in real life,wars are very hard and we can sometimes win,or lose. but peace can also be hard to obtain,and i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thing,and are trying to obtain world peace.<br /><br />but however,this show is truly the best of the best. so in closing to this review,after you watch this show,see the movie endless waltz.
