i would say for it's time, this movie was awesome...and yes if you have no desire to become a christian, then why bother watching it. i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving. i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind series...they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people. i think in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if i am not mistaken...don't use our comments to judge, see the movie for yourself!! god will bless you if that is why you are watching them.
