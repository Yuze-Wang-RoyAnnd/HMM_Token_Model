i was having just about the worst day of my life. then i stumbled on this cute film, watched it, and now i'm ready to go out & kiss a streetlamp.<br /><br />i have to admit, i only watched it for 2 reasons: vera-ellen's legs. but it's really so much more. the plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven. it's almost like a shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful misunderstandings. and of course there's also... vera-ellen's legs.<br /><br />the only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version i purchased (the "100 family classics" collection by mill creek entertainment) doesn't have the best video quality, and i've heard the same about the alpha release. the brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when vera is dancing in a white dress. but i suppose you can fiddle with the controls of your tv set to compensate. i can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in '51. the stage sets, costumes & colours are otherwise dazzling & delightfully creepy--sort of in a "cabinet of dr. caligari" vein.<br /><br />as far as the romance goes, this is just perfect. not sappy, not contrived, not melodramatic. just 100% ahhhhhh. too bad, you poor schmucks, your miserable lives will never be as charming as this. har har har. wait, what am i laughing at? my life sucks just as bad as yours. oh hell. time to watch this movie again.
