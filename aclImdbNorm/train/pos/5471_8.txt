during 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that lily powers,(barbara stanwyck) would do anything to obtain great wealth and power. lily's father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on lily. as the story progresses, lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president it is great to see a very young john wayne, (jimmy mccoy jr.) who was only 25 when this picture was produced and jimmy did not even get to first base with lily, not even for lunch. a very young george brent, (coutland trenholm) stars along with barbara stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances. this is a great film from 1933 which was produced by darryl f. zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen. this film is rather mild compared to what we view on the hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film. enjoy
