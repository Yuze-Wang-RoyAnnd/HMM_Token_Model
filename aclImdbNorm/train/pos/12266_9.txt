imagine that i was about to miss this great cultural event on swedish tv last night, and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the tv on (to make it easier for her to fall asleep!) that i came across it (yes i had seen an advert for it previously but of course forgotten about it and looked forward to an 'early night'...).<br /><br />anyway - this must surely be a rather unusual idea - to base a film documentary on an interview made with sound only more than 30 years ago. but with animated and other documentary film material it adds up to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the 20th centuries' most appreciated literary artists - georges remy a.k.a herg'e.<br /><br />i for sure will read my tintin albums with a different eye after having seen this film, which makes it easier to connect the variations in style as well as content with the different periods in herg'e's life (and i can tell you that i will a.s.a.p get the few that i don't have). of course my perception of the albums has changed over the more than 25 years that i have already been reading them, as has my view about what albums are my favourites, but this adds (at least) one more dimension to them.
