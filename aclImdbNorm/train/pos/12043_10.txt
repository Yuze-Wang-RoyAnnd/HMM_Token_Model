...on stage, tv or in a book, 'the woman in black' is an outstanding ghost story. other reviewers have already said just about all there is to say about this film, but i thought i would add my belated little review too. the made-for-tv movie has a deliberately slow first act, which chronicles the main character arthur as he goes about his business as a solicitor in 1920s london. i can understand why this might not appeal to all palates. nevertheless, for me, i love this british-style of storytelling similar to any of the bbc's "ghost story for christmas" adaptations of the great m.r. james' work. in the second act, the ghost story kicks in as arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss, to tidy up the affairs of a deceased client. the third act relentlessly builds up to a spine-tingling conclusion... as a londoner, i have seen the play. i own the book, dvd-r and have the unabridged audio book on my ipod, too. what is sure for me, 'the women in black' on any medium is a ghost story with few equals. it is about time that we had a legitimate region 2 dvd release.
