this is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life. to put it in perspective it was when gay was the word used for the homo-sexual revolution, and not just gay as a descriptor. or is it still used that way today? i believe most of the film comes from circa 1968 to 1989. it was released in 1993, so it's been around.<br /><br />i was touched by the documentaries capturing of one man's love for another over a 20 some odd year period. a love expressed in ways that only true love can be. there are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. there are scenes of life as a homo-sexual and life as a gay. the film itself was a work of love, and i believe it to be a diamond.<br /><br />at the very least one will get out of this film an understanding of the devastating impact of aids. as i write this, i am thinking how much earlier this film seems to me to have been set. the advances in medical, political, and social sciences and culture that have taken place since this film was set (some 15 years ago) are amazing. however, obviously, in the case of the disease of aids itself, we are not done yet. heck i guess we aren't done on all fronts.<br /><br />anyway, it's just a pretty darn good documentary. i'd encourage anyone that feels that they don't quite understand gay life, gay issues, or the devastation of aids to watch this film.
