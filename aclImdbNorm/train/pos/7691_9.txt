this show was a landmark in american comedy as it was the first sitcom to star an all afro-american cast. sadly though it was never broad-casted on british tv.<br /><br />the evans family are a poor afro-american family living in a tower block. the dad is called james, he tries to run the house, but his wife florida always gets the better of him. the three children are the artistic jj, the moody thelma and the young intellectual child michael. always coming into the house is florida's gossipy friend willona.<br /><br />i watched two episodes of this show on youtube (black jesus and sex and the evans family- the only two on the site). you may be thinking why has an english viewer watched a series that has never been shown or hardly heard of in his country. the answer is this. in 1976, britains first all black sitcom came out called "the fosters" only two series were made and it now seems forgotten. but i watched an episode and was really impressed. then i learnt that the scripts were identical to "good times". they were exactly the same characters but with different names- sam foster was the dad, his wife was pearl foster and the three children were sonny (a young lenny henry), shirley and benjamin. pearl's gossipy friend was vilma. (to read about the fosters, i have wrote a review about that). whilst watching "good times" only two things annoyed me. first off was the opening theme tune (awful) and secondly was the audience laughter. i like audience laughter, but in this somebody would say a slightly funny line and the audience would go mad and start clapping. apart from that it was a very funny show. let's hope more episodes turn up on youtube and lets hope that someone will release "the fosters" on dvd in england.<br /><br />best episode: sex and the evans family- series 1 episode 6. the foster's episode of it was called sex in the black community. the other episode i saw, black jesus was a title of one episode of "the fosters"
