could not understand why jeremy irons felt it necessary to exhibit a most disconcerting accent, spoken through clenched teeth,and from the back of his throat. in fact it rather spoiled the film for me, and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him (very irritating). no other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and whilst i have always rated jeremy irons as a fine actor, i would not class this film as being one of his best. the film however has whetted my appetite, as have some of the other comments made re this film, which i have found very interesting,and intend to now read the book.
