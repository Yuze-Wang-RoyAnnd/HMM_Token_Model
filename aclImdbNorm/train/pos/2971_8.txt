i found this movie to be very funny, i loved how it made of the politics of modern day sports. this movie is not as funny as south park but it is pretty funny. and since i am a sports fan i loved how they made fun some of the more ridiculous things in sports. this movie is great for non sports lovers too, probably better for them actually since they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so closing when there are so many insane rules and intricacies to sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. i also found the actual game they came up with to be interesting, it is sort of like horse with bases and psyche outs (for the person shooting). overall i highly recommend you see this movie, and believe that you will end up loving this movie. however if this style of comedy is not your favorite you probably won't like it. (but that is with any comedy movie)
