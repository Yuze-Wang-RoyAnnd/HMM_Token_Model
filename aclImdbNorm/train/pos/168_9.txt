this is one of joan crawford's best talkies. it was the first gable-crawford pairing, and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team, leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars.<br /><br />the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the stock market crash, must fend for themselves and work for a living. life is hard in the depression, and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile, and they resort to underworld activity. <br /><br />joan crawford is excellent as the socialite-turned-moll. she's smart, complex, and believable. she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early talkie acting style. clark gable is a diamond-in-the rough, masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with crawford's character. the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in "a free soul", securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgm.<br /><br />if you like crawford in this type of role, don't miss "paid", which she did a year earlier, which is also among her best early talkie performances.<br /><br />
