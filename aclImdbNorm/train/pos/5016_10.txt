this movie is one of my very favorites. it's hard to explain why. maybe it's the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak, but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack. also, some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves. finally, the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings, and the last scene is so bittersweet. all in all, i love this movie; it's perfect for a gooey, sentimental girls' night.
