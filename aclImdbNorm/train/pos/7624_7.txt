a pretty memorable movie of the animals-killing-people variety, specifically similar to "willard" in that it stars an aging character actor (in this case, a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne, who puts in the only distinguished performance i've seen him give) in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him. yes, this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable, so that you will cheer when they die, and really the selection of actors, locations, etc. couldn't be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence.<br /><br />tremayne's character is "snakey bender", and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie: an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souza's music. when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes, and his friend gets married to a stripper (thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert) he goes on the rampage, in the process creating a memorable pile-up of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners. one amusing game you can play while watching "snakes" is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff.<br /><br />all in all, very cheap and exploitative, but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies.
