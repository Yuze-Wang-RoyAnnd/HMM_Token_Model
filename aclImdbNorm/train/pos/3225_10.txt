when i rented this movie to watch it, i knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie. instead i thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating. and you know what it worked. kurt russel did what i though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was. i recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film.
