fabulous actors, beautiful scenery, stark reality. i won't elaborate on all of the other reviewers' comments because you get the picture! however, the movie isn't for the squeamish. reality is slaughtering pigs and other livestock in order to survive. i also have elinore randall stewart's homestead book. i read it several years ago, i have to reread it, since i just watched the newly-released, remastered dvd of the movie.<br /><br />i tried to buy the video for several years, finally bought it used from a video store that went out of business. but yippee! the dvd is now for sale, i purchased it on amazon.com. not cheap, but well worth it to me. this is a movie i will be watching until the end of my days!
