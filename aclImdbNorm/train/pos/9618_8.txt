i recently bought this movie and i do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact i am very please have this movie to add to my collection. matt manfredi and phil hay, movie directors, took less than one month to film and spent about 1 million eur to produce this great movie. this proves that not only big productions make great movies.<br /><br />the title of this movie fits in perfectly. in computer language bug means program error which causes reactions in computer function. our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. the vertiginous happenings in this movie start with the death of a bug. a man witnesses the "crime" on the other side of the road...from there onwards everything gets complicated...<br /><br />i point out john carrol lynch ("fargo"), wallece, the man who cannot make everything right at all.
