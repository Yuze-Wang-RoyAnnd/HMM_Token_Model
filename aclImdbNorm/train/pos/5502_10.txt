whether this movie is propaganda or not (i firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of media. the importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man chavez is. it is really to demonstrate the way the bolivarians saw how it happened, the chavez way of seeing it. although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film , i think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate. the venezuelian people via the private media corporation of venezuela only saw a one side perspective of the coup, the neo-liberal side. this movie shows us the way the bolivarians saw it . call it propaganda , i say it's a judgment call on your part.
