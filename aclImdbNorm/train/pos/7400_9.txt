this is a great story of family loyalty which, thankfully, doesn't resort to the usual tricks (or at least the ones i'm used to seeing in american and european films) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension.<br /><br />it's very watchable and very lovable. it has some beautiful cinematography, but doesn't rely on that alone to entertain.
