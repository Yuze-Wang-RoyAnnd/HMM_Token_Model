billed as the story of steve biko -- played excellently by denzel washington, as you'd expect -- this was actually more the story of donald woods, played by kevin kline.<br /><br />this was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor, and he was surprisingly good in the role.<br /><br />attenborough gave this the sort of direction you'd expect, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get across.<br /><br />the remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job, in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past.
