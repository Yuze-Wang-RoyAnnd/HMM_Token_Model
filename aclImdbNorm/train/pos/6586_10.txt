jeremy brett is simply the best holmes ever, narrowly edging out the great basil rathbone of course, and this is probably the best adaptation of a conon-doyle short story.<br /><br />a length adaptation includes some new plot strands that fit in well to the surrounding drama and heightens the hatred one feels for milverton.<br /><br />excellent performances all round, especially from robert hardy, and both brett and hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their roles makes this a superb piece of drama.
