i remember seeing this movie a long time ago, back then even though it didn't have any special effects, the acting was really good. and it still has the same message for today, even though the technology has changed, maybe they should make a remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. i also enjoyed the music from the movie as well, larry norman was a really good songwriter during that time period, although now most christian music is now worship and praise music. i was always curious to know what ever happened to patty after the series ended? did she go on to make more movies, did she get eventually get married and raise a family? i would like to have an update.
