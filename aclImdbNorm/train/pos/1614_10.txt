there is nothing not to like about moonstruck. i'm from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it. the actors & actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor.. they were all fantastic. it starts a little slow, but a lot happens in that two days! i fell in love with laboheme because of this movie. on my list of favorite movies, moonstruck is number 3. it's a "feel good" movie where you leave the theatre humming "that's amore" or repeating some of your favorite lines: "old man, if you give those dogs another piece of my food, i'll kick you till you're dead"; "chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who's dead", "do you love him loretta....., good because when you do, they drive you crazy because they know they can". i always put moonstruck on when there's nothing good to watch because it makes me happy.
