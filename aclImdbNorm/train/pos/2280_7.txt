hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller? mother night is a very good vonnegut novel, and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. the "indie" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it. these days, i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses. and normally that is too bad, but not in this case. mother night has tight direction and a solid cast. nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older, still has that "everyman" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always. i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. i guess making your debut as a dead girl (twin peaks)with little air time isn't the choicest of roles, even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon. anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. in fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the novel's premise may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding (i am talking to you, fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography, history, and lord knows what other subjects!).
