this was a great movie! even though there was only about 15 people including myself there it was great! my friend and i laughed a lot. my mom even enjoyed it. there was two middle aged women there and a mid 20 year old there and they seemed to enjoy it. i love the part where corky and ned are like both liking nancy and stuff its cute lol. and when she gets her roadster and ned is there. yeah this was a great movie even thought people underestimated it lol. go see it i bet you'll enjoy it!! i really enjoyed it and so did my friend. <br /><br />people were so tough on this movie and they hadn't even seen it. i bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance. they all did a great job in my opinion. but if you have young kids its still appropriate. i will probably take my 7 year old niece to watch it too.
