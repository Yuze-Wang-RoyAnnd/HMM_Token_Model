this movie took me by complete surprise. i watched it 2 or 3 times. i really liked this film. there were many truths this movie brought up. i love all the characters in this film as well. this movie makes a lot of sense because as society "becomes more advance" what does the culture loose? not to sound preachy. i can really relate to this movie from my child hood and loosing apart of my life that will never come back or ever been the same. this film is on my top 5 movies i have ever watched. there is just such a raw truth that i feel when i watch the movie and its not the kind of truth that you have to dig for its right in front of your face. the creators of this film did a great job and i enjoyed this movie very much. this movie may not be for every one but if you have an open mind i think you will love it.
