go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy goldsworthy's sculptures, and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye-opening and relaxing experience. the music perfectly complements the footage, but never draws attention towards itself. some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot, but consider this: why would you expand on this in a movie, if you can read andy's musings at length in his books, or attend one of his excellent lectures? this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works, and is used expertly in this respect.
