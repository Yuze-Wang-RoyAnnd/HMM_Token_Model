at your video store, you might find this gem.<br /><br />the human condition in modern times la. no exaggerated drama, just a collapsing of events that might happen to any group of individuals over time.<br /><br />helps you understand the joys and desperation of urban life.<br /><br />the direction and cutting are top class. cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation. and the cast!!! <br /><br />excellent casting and excellent acting. no one out of place or out of character.<br /><br />and it's not really as much a downer as you would expect. i gave it 7 of 10.<br /><br />if you havent seen it, do!
