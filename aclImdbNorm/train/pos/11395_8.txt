i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites. it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli. it won two academy awards for best picture of 1951 and best screenplay. the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big. nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him, but soon finds she loves the guy. meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel, leslie caron. his main dancing partner, and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. famous french singer georges guietary sings, too. so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levant's nimble piano fingers, the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem. 8/10
