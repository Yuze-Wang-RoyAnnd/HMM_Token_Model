also known as "water lilies" this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex. this story is told at a slow pace and that works very well. it gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them.<br /><br />using a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people playing in this film handle that well. everyone is completely believable. visual setting is great, especially the underwater shots in the swimming pool add a nice effect.<br /><br />many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them. it pulls some "standard" pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them. it isn't bad, not at all, but it surely isn't great either and i do feel it could have done better if it had taken some what less explored angles.<br /><br />7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
