this is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a ny production of macbeth. although it has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the themes of macbeth) in our modern world, the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously. recognizable actors such as john glover, gloria reubens and david lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the "murder" of banquo (john elsen) is rehearsed. probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre, but anyone who enjoys shakespeare should enjoy this film.
