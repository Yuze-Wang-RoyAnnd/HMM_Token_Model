making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is never a good idea. when people read the book, they automatically start making their own "mental movie" of who the characters look like, the places they exist in, how the situations progress. and everybody's mind's-eye opus is different, which is why when the 'real' movie finally comes out, you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up.<br /><br />all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is, and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see.<br /><br />there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king. when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (carrie, 'salem's lot, the dead zone), or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess (kubrick's version of the shining; the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers). <br /><br />although it's not even close to being the perfect king adaptation, pet sematary has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book, that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. for that, we have music video-turned-film director mary lambert to thank, (she also directed siesta, not exactly a horror movie, but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list), working from a screenplay by the 'man-ster' himself, and probably one of his better ones.<br /><br />since the majority of you know the story, i won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. dr. louis creed (dale midkiff) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front, and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well, even if you haven't read the book, do the frickin' math. it is a king story, after all, so no mystery where this is headed. <br /><br />it's not so much the destination that counts here, but the spooky stops along the way. certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery, scream-inducing life here: rachel creed's (star trek's denise crosby) horrific memory of her terminally ill, crippled sister; louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow (brad greenquist), both before and after his death; the trip into the "other" cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. and that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse.<br /><br />good performances by all here, especially the late fred gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor, jud crandall, who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up: "sometimes, dead is better."<br /><br />about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louis's son, gage (miko hughes). knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this, lambert and crew still did the best they could, and unfortunately, hughes at the time was just too damn cute to "sell" his intended role as an evil, demon-possessed zombie. this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up, though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged, (especially gwynne's death scene.)<br /><br />other than that, everything else is still about as good as it gets. carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as i'm concerned; but sematary is right up there in the top five.<br /><br />still, will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story? not bloody likely...for now.
