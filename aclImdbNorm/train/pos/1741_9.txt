this is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word. it tells a tail that here in greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. sure it has some extremes.. but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art.it is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them. the film has a deeper understanding of greek ways of life, stereotypes, and social structure. unlike most greek films that have a certain fast-food-mainstream audience, this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings. i am not a big fan of traditional music either but i wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film.<br /><br />if someone told me to say something against this film i'd define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut. i guess the editing had to cut it up to fit the 2hours and a bit for the theatres..<br /><br />anyway i could write more and more to express my thought over this but i guess u have to see it and discuss it with a friend. a must see
