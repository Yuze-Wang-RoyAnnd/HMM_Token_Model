i don't know if this is a sitcom or not, but i agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever. it's great that this show still airs. and i love michelle. it's cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked, and she sometimes said something funny. aw.<br /><br />this show can relate to children and teens and.. well, families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family. i don't know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone. <br /><br />i love the episode when i think her name is dd.. the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt, and she learned a lesson about stealing. that was a great episode. an example that this tv show shows the family working things out as a family.<br /><br />i recommend this show for everyone.
