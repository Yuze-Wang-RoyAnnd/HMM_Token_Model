maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly, despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility. she will do everything to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. and thus beneath the vicey exterior, she reveals a rather sweet value system. the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate, with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with 'and then i woke up'. it is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence i've ever seen, but don't let any of that put you off.
