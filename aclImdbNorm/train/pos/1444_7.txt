***spoilers*** when undercover brooklyn north det. eddie santos, nestor serrano,was to meet his drug supplier tito zapatti, larry romano, in the williamsburg section of brooklyn in a buy and bust operation, with tito being the one who gets busted, that things went haywire with both det. santos and tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other. during the deadly shootout an innocent bystander six year-old james bone jr.,jaliyl lynn,was also killed in the cross-fire.<br /><br />with new york city slated to host the 1996 democratic presidential convention that summer that last thing that the city's flamboyant mayor pappas, al pacino, wanted was a possible riot over young james bones tragic death by a possible, in was later determined that it was a bullet from tito's gun that killed young james, member of the new york city police department.<br /><br />what was far more shocking then even bone's death is that his killer tito zapatti was given probation by the well respected ny state judge walter stern, martin landau. when he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the backseat of his car! it soon became evident that the person who got judge stern his job, for a $50,000.00 payoff, was non other the brooklyn political boss frank anselmo, danny aiello. it's anselmo who's involved with mayor pappas in a land deal, involving the new york subway system, that would bring him and his real estate friends tens of millions of dollars over the next two years! it would also indirectly connect mayor pappas in the bone killing by connecting him to judge stern, who made it possible for tito be be free, who's a mutual friend of both him and his gomba, or landsman, frank anselmo!<br /><br />to keep all this from blowing up the late det. santons is framed, by working undercover without the authority from his superiors, in the bone shooting. in fact those framing santos go as far and hiding some $40,000.00 in cash in his upstate summer home making it look like he was being paid off by tito's uncle mafia boss paul zapatti, anthony francoisa, for letting his nephew deal drugs with him getting a piece of the action. which may well explain him, as well as tito, getting shot by tito welshing on his paying santos off!<br /><br />as things turn out it's mayor pappas' deputy in city hall kevin calhoun, john cusack, who ends up messing everything up for his boss by being too honest in finding who was responsible in covering up tito's criminal record that allowed him to be out on the streets. the facts that kevin uncovered lead straight to frank anselmo, a major political supporter of mayor pappas, who as it turned out was connected by the hip to tito's mafia chieftain uncle paul!<br /><br />a bit over-plotted "city hall" does show how big city corruption can filter up, as well as down, to everyone in city government without them, like mayor pappas, even knowing about it. mayor pappas biggest sin was that he was friends with brooklyn boss anselmo who was putting people into jobs, like judge stern, who were subjected to being blackmailed from anselmo's real boss mafioso paul zapatti.<br /><br />***spoilers*** it only took a deadly shootout in williamsburg to set everything into motion not by only tito, besides det. santos and james bone, being killed but why he was allowed to be out on the street in order to bring the very popular new york city mayor down. mayor pappas was looking forward to much bigger things, like governor or even president, in his future political pursuits. as it turned out his top deputy kevin calhoun in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise. as well as that of the mayor's good friend frank anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench, as a state judge, judge stern. who's decision in letting tito zapatti off made this whole disaster, which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide, possible!
