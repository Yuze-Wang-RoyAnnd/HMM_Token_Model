so, what's the reason? is there some sort of vendetta against this awesome show or somebody involved therein? why would the best show i've seen in years be canceled? i'm addicted. i saw this show on randomly last fall, and immediately loved it, and watched it every week. then it went away, and i tried to tivo it, but it wasn't being aired. so i forgot about it for awhile, until i found the episodes on abc's website. now i want more. i agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on tv today, it was refreshing to see something as well-rounded and developed as this. i watch boston legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and house for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix. my wife loves grey's anatomy for its "realism", and i do love/hate the show, but it could not be farther from real for me. way too much drama. everything that can go wrong, does. but for once, there's a drama that's really real. real people, real problems. sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in nyc) are really out there, and i relate to each and every one of them. i can't seem to get enough. i just hope that abc will get their heads out of their bean-counting butts and continue this show. get some respect for having a quality drama out there. this could be one of the best shows of all time. if somebody will just let it.
