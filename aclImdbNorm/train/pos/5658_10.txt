this was one of the best shows ever made for tv. full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. compulsive viewing. i was lucky i saw this in the uk. they might have got the episode order wrong, i can't remember, but it at least was on at a regular time every week. my girlfriend and i got hooked from the trailer in, and neither of us is a big fan of american series normally.<br /><br />after the pilot, we knew this was something special. we missed a couple of episodes, and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol.<br /><br />great casting, superb acting. gary cole was absolutely brilliant, better even than his role as custer. lucas black turned in an amazing performance for a kid, and paige turco was at her best too since party of five. and nick searcy of course, as the sheriff's long suffering sidekick.<br /><br />yes, there were some confusing and perplexing bits, which i presume would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. that made the ending weak, and you could tell they'd killed it. made us go what? why did they do that with one of the best shows ever? shoot the exec.
