rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to planet earth... of *course* planet earth is better - it has much much more of the same. earth is like an extended trailer for the planet earth series, and as such, is inevitably inferior and simplified. but that is not comparing like with like.<br /><br />as a feature-length documentary (or actually as a feature-length anything), it surpasses pretty much anything you will see in your entire life (unless you choose to traverse the earth in helicopters with long-range cameras for years on end, and wait for months in the most extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth, which - lets face it - is unlikely).<br /><br />on the narration: yes everyone in the uk - very much including me - adores david attenborough, and there's little excuse for him not to be narrating here, but that hardly deserves knocking down a star or three. he wasn't a presenter on planet earth, just a narrator, and i'm sure he's modest and gracious enough to realise that anything that gets more viewers in is a good thing.<br /><br />anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its awe, majesty and glory. all reviewers agree on that. those who love it (ie. everyone) will/should go on to see an buy planet earth. so three cheers for its cinematic release, and a big boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on dvd rather than the planet earth box-set. but as works of art they're not in competition here people.<br /><br />the earth is big enough for both.
