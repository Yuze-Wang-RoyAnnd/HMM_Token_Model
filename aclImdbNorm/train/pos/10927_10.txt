this is one of my favourite kung-fu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late 70's. the plot is interesting and twisty, the characters are cool each with their own style - toad, snake, lizard etc. the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh / venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung-fu styles on display from the various characters. i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang cheh's films are the same, most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and shaolin vs manchu conflicts. this film is breath of fresh air in comparison.
