as far as parody films go, there are few that are worth time and energy. but with a recent resurgence of horrid parodies such as date movie and the comebacks, it is a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a truly funny farce like johnny dangerously.<br /><br />after his mother has no end of medical problems, little johnny goes to work for the mob. what fallows is a series of gags, most of which work, there are, however, the occasional flops. but a foreign gangster who can't master the american language (profanity wise, at least), a rival gangster with a penchant for shooting his mouth off (...once!), a younger brother with the d.a. who is out to get johhny dangerously, and a hot young starlet hot for his affections have johnny busy.<br /><br />and the viewer will be busy laughing, for the most part, as every gangster-movie clich'e is skewered by a talented cast and decent writing.<br /><br />not perfect by a long shot, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
