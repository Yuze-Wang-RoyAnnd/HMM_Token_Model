i found the fbi story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my new years day holiday viewing. its drama and action-packed episodes were thrilling. the hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. overall the photography, script and direction was perfectly creditable. rather than taking the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda, as some might, i enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. again, the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband's commitment to his (arguably) important work, i did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one.
