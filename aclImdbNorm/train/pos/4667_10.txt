i recently found this movie on vhs after looking for it for a number of years, i was not disappointed. it gets better every time i see it. peter ustinov stars and co-wrote the original screenplay (nominated for an academy award). other stars you've heard of include karl malden, bob newhart and cesar romero. ustinov plays an accountant/embezzler, just released from england's infamous wormwood scrubs prison (he had embezzled from the conservative party headquarters, selected because he is a liberal). he immediately begins a search for a new employer from whom he can embezzle, and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. he social-engineers his way into a london men's club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in town, he steals the identity of one caesar smith, who has just left town for south america to pursue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild. he talks his way into ta-can-co, an american conglomerate headed by carlton klemper (karl malden). klemper hires smith and shows him around the computer center, especially its security feature consisting of a flashing blue light. ustinov asks the computer how to defeat its security and the computer obligingly tells, him, "disconnect blue light." using hacking techniques from 30 years in the future, ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written to various bogus companies. the scheme starts to unravel when klemper's assistant willard g. gnatpole (bob newhart) notices the amount of business ta-can-co appears to be transacting with ustinov's scam companies. with the help of his secretary patty terwilliger (maggie smith), ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily ever after. to tell you how would spoil this very funny, romantic, intelligent, and ahead-of-its-time picture.
