heartland was in production about the same time as michael cimino's heaven's gate - heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film.<br /><br />heaven's gate was "the biggest and most expensive ($40 mil in 1980!) hollywood flops of all time, its failure resulted in the sale of the united artists studio to mgm" -imdb entry <br /><br />heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing, direction, photography and acting. it easily draws you into the beauty, joys, hardships and sorrow of pioneer life.<br /><br />it's sad that hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys (based on a director's single big hit) and neglect such a wonderful story.
