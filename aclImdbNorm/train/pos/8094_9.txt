first of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with master writer like tolkien. this adaptation wonderfully synthesizes tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little "rough" in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that's far superior to the acting in the new live action movies. and while the cell animation might not be the most "technically proficient" animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. the background paintings vary from traditional "fantasy" motif to outright abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. if you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then i can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and jrr tolkien then this film is a must see.
