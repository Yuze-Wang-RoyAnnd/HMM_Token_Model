this is an "odysessy through time" via computer animation, supposedly th work of over 300 artists. made in the late '80s and released in 1990, this was cutting edge stuff for the day. i thought it was good and quite interesting in spots.<br /><br />most of the short scenes made no sense, just forms evolving into other forms, but that was fun to watch. this is all about visuals, not really about any kind of a story. there were some strange sequences in which odd-looking men- creatures would dance around with birds overheard. all of it is computer animated which was new back then. even the term "computer animated" was not well-known.<br /><br />it's simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon-like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. no words, just pictures with electronic music. stoners must have really loved this.<br /><br />it's a nice, intriguing 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "head candy." by today's cg effects this may have lost impact, but i think you'd still be entertained by this.
