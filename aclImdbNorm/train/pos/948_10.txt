this is simply one of the finest renditions of dicken's classic tale. the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens, and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere. viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice.<br /><br />george c. scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge, and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts. i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser, something rarely done in other versions. the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen.
