i'm a 53 year-old college professor. i went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. we all enjoyed the movie. the film is original, witty, fast-paced and totally charming. the plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow, but twisty enough to keep an adult interested. i thought emma roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine. my only criticism is that the los angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. they were functional, but nothing stood out. on the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. altogether, i thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. i am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the film. apparently, they have something against films that portray strong, intelligent and independent young women. their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family film. i recommend it strongly to every child and every parent.
