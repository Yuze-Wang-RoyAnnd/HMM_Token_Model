i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie.when i finally saw it,i took a good surprise.the movie isn't great thing but it's very fun and the action scenes are very well done.this movie reminded me tv series like 24 or alias.it's very similar to that series and it reminded me too,to the wolfgang petersen's thriller in the line of fire.if you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies,you will be disappointed.but if you go with little expectations,you will enjoy the sentinel.<br /><br />rating:7
