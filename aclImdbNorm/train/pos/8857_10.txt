director sidney lumet has made some masterpieces,like network,dog day afternoon or serpico.but,he was not having too much luck on his most recent works.gloria (1999) was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting,but failed experiment.now,lumet brings his best film in decades and,by my point of view,a true masterpiece:before the devil knows you're dead.i think this film is like a rebirth for lumet.this movie has an excellent story which,deeply,has many layers.also,i think the ending of the movie is perfect.the performances are brilliant.philip seymour hoffman brings,as usual,a magnificent performance and he's,no doubt,one of the best actors of our days.ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he's underrated by my point of view.his performance in here is great.the rest of the cast is also excellent(specially,the great albert finney) but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars.the film has a good level of intensity,in part thanks to the performances and,in part,thanks to the brilliant screenplay.before the devil knows you're dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction,a great screenplay and excellent performances.we need more movies like this.
