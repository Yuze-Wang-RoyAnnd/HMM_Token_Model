cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise. it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. the majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. a class a film with fine acting and directing. this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists. it is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs. a good film worth watching several times annually.
