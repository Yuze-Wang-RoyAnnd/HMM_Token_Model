buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when "humanizing" animals, and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them.<br /><br />based on a true story, buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other, and that they will do anything for each other.<br /><br />while not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children.<br /><br />this film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets, but does show the difficulties.<br /><br />a recommended film which was the first for jim henson productions.
