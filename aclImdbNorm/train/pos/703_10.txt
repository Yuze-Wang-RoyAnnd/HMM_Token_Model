i rated this a ten just because i find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera. it's no epic but it's plenty engaging and i was never bored. if tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse, then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens. i know i'll be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release. damn good job, and well worth the money. what a script! it might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures i've seen lately. nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen. serious kudos to her, can't wait to see more.
