this documentary was nominated for an oscar and it's easy to see why. even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work. why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only disney can explain. good use of live footage and animation in tandem. this used to run as part of "vault disney" every few months or so, but i haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* most recommended.
