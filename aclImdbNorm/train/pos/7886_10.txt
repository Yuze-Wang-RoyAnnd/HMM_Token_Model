okay, i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst! but it's not!!! haven't's you seen freddy's revenge??? wtf! that was the worst of all!!! now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and it's cool that he had a daughter etc. etc.<br /><br />and then i found out it was in 3-d!!! i was so excited, i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly skipped to the 3-d sequences. quite a lot was in 3-d though like lisa zanes hand, dream demons, freddy's claw (more than once), lezlie dean holding a knife, lisa zane with a baseball bat, doc's hand, freddy's head exploding.<br /><br />i truly loved this movie because it was in 3-d, but i wish the whole movie was in 3-d not just the last 15 minutes.<br /><br />by the way it's 15 minutes not ten!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
