my son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a russian fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of the legend of the boy and the eagle. he has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him. i am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. since we have indian blood he connects to this movie. on january 27th he will turn 47 years old and i would like to be able to obtain this movie for him. he lives in thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. can you help me obtain this movie? thanking you in advance, dolly crout-soto, deerfield beach, fl
