okay, i didn't get the purgatory thing the first time i watched this episode. it seemed like something significant was going on that i couldn't put my finger on. this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my attention- and it helped that i was just writing an essay on inferno! but let me see what hasn't been discussed yet...<br /><br />a twop review mentioned that tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator. yeah, 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons, especially religious, but here's one more for ya. on a hunch i consulted wikipedia, and guess what dante divided into 7 levels? purgatorio. excluding ante-purgatory and paradise. (the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and... what tony can't get to.) <br /><br />on to the allegedly "random" monk-slap scene. as soon as the monks appeared, it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of purgatory. you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial (death, disease, and sin) came on, and he's getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him. by the time he meets the monks he's thinking "hey maybe these guys can help me?" which sounds like contemplating other religions (e.g. buddhism) and wondering if some other path could take him to "salvation". not that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a buddhist, but it appears finnerty tried that (and messed up). that slap in the face basically tells tony there's no quick fix- as in, no, you can't suddenly embrace buddhism and get out of here. <br /><br />tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven. but at the "conference entrance", he realizes that's not going to be so easy for him. at first i saw the name vs. driver's license problem as tony having led sort of a double life, what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people. he feels free to have an affair with quasi-melfi because "he's kevin finnerty". he figures out that he can fool some people with kf's cards, like hotel receptionists, but it won't get him out of purgatory. those helicopters- the helicopters of heaven?- are keeping track of him and everything he does.<br /><br />after reading all the theories on "infinnerty", though, it seems like kf's identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths tony could've taken in his life. possibly along with the car joke involving infiniti's that made no sense to me otherwise. aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out.
