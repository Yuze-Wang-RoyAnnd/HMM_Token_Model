i thought that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the lives of mary-kate's and ashley's characters sam and emma stanton! they are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but; unfortunately, it's just not that easy for them to actually do! i thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then i'm sure that you'll agree with me here! if you haven't seen this movie yet then i say you really missed-out; big time, and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now! this movie is a real winner! sincerely, rick morris
