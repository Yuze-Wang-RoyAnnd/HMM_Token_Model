after viewing several episodes of this series, i have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. here is an old science fiction standby, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and still they can only -almost - make it work.<br /><br />the dialog is good! the male actors are reasonably proficient at their professions. most of the characters are well drawn, with special kudos to the hero and his more than likeable side-kick. and most of the episode plots come across as palatable. so what could be wrong? how about the, the female characters and the cosmeticly perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them. <br /><br />the producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost good - series, in a manner that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader. why, i ask, why?<br /><br />the episodes all fall flat whenever the female guest star or recurring character comes on screen. these actresses are all totally unbelievable in their roles, and you don't actually have to see them to know they are incapable of their acting assignments. a blind person could tell. just listen to them talk. they deliver their dialog with all the drama and effect of a 16 year old at the high school prom. who would believe these women are phd scientist, senators, corporate executives and medical doctors?<br /><br />in a nut shell, if the producers have their choice of a stockard channing or a morgan fairchild, guess who they'll choose - every time? and of course, the series suffers for it. too bad!
