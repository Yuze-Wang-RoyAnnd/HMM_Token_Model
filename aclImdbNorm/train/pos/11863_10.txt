perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if it's not it's certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what brian de palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork. first there is the director's touch of brian de palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever, there is the superb performance from al pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen (tony montana), there are the many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (the one with the chainsaw, the one in where tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most people's living rooms), there are the many superb one-liners (count how many times the word "f*ck" is used), there are the superb little details (the pan american-globe that screams "the world is yours") or the great discomusic from giorgio moroder. nothing can be named that isn't sublime here and it easily is along with "the godfather", "good fellas" and "white heat" one of the best gangstermovies ever made!
