this movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world. john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "sam" hits close to home, is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with. ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with. i'm sure i've met arthur in my travels somewhere. all around, an excellent choice to pick up any evening.!:-)
