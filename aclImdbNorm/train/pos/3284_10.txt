my name is john mourby and this is my story about paperhouse: in may 2003 i saw alfred hitchcock's psycho, i was very scared and deeply disturbed. i began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way. but none where satisfactory. amongst those tried and failed were the birds, night of the living dead, the silence of the lambs, the blair witch project, ring, the evil dead, the sixth sense, 28 days later, the texas chainsaw massacre, halloween, near dark, alien, peeping tom, the cell, rosemary's baby, don't look now, witchfinder general, friday the 13th and the omen. that should confirm i was desperate! long after i had stopped searching i found out about paperhouse
