a small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store, and picking stuff just because i haven't seen it. a large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen.<br /><br />long before elia kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies (not good ones), he made this better than average drama. watching it you begin to notice how many decent, good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated. contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large... preferably large, and unsubtle, and scandalous. kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director. (um. no thanks) <br /><br />his future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot. the plague is coming! but here's an atypical richard widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; here's an almost watchable barabra bel geddes, with her bathos turned way down (well, for her); they're a couple and they share some nicely-written scenes about big crises and smaller ones. here's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships-crew; here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment. these are the small-scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something hollywood, in its greed, now studiously avoids. these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them. it's a personable, human-scaled film, not the grotesque, overscaled production that he and others (david lean) will later popularize, whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as pirates of the caribean and moulin rouge.<br /><br />i just watched it twice and i'll be damned if i could tell you what jack palance is seeking in the final scenes, but it doesn't seem that important to me as a viewer. this reminds me of both no way out a poitier noir with widmark as the villain, and naked city, which you should really get your hands on.
