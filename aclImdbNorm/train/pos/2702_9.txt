ok, so i know of this movie because of a friend of mine's in it and i actually visited the set when they were filming, so from a personal stand-point, i was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem. if you dig at all on info regarding this movie, you'll find it's mired in legal troubles (even over 7 years after being filmed) so, if you are at all like me -- then you'll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy. my source? ebay. about $15 but i felt ripped because when i got it today in the mail, it was a very rough, grainy copy of a "screener only" release, complete with annoying top mini time-code but alas, i could still enjoy it but not as much as if i had a proper copy, something i suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not have on you. from what i have gleaned, it's been released on dvd in germany & now spain. with that, good luck & happy searching/bidding...;). the score/sndtrk is worth it alone. very eclectic and varied (somethinbg rare these days imho in film) -- i think that will be my next sndtrk/score to locate, but i digress... <br /><br />now, onto the review. the film opens as billy zane's character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in. he steals her clothes (even shoes) and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bank/loan shop but after escaping with the loot, well, i guess this is where the "plot" begins -- he inadvertently looses it. after perpetrating several campy over-the-top crimes & dalliances to various a to c-list celebs to locate the money, he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral -- i think for the dead guy he shoots in the loan office/bank, and -- even with 1950's police cars and cops looking all over for him steadily throughout -- he never gets seen or nabbed. (he sees daily newspapers reporting his "crimes") this i liked, because it gave the thin plot an extension. after all, it's a movie (see: fiction) & director iris iliopulos does what i think is everything possible to 1) bring wood's vision to fruition and 2) give it an updated feel, yet have shots of authentic 50's police cars intertwined with, ahh, local l.a..99$ stores -- so well hence my 9 rating. if the period and props were authentic -- i would have given it a 10. now it wraps it self up kinda weird and i won't spoil it for anyone but let's just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it, to me, it had promise, action and comedy -- all up till the end, so...with all that said --locate a copy at your own discretion.<br /><br />just realize that, as there is no dialouge (except for some narration and singing) this may be up your alley -- maybe not-- but i definitely think it's worth a watch. the actors all do fine performances and it's only the inconsistency in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that correction -- then i would say by all means check this film out for it's not like anything these studios put out these days (or will in the future, too) i am sure.
