terry gilliam gives a stunning movie, which i thoroughly enjoyed. bruce willis, madeline stowe, brad pitt and even the small appearance of christover plummer makes the movie absolutely brilliant! this is the only terry gilliam film i've seen, and twelve monkeys is definitely in my top 10. i think this is one of the four best bruce willis movies; and brad pitt's best. brad pitt delivers a perfect performance. possibly one of the ten best actor's performance that i've ever seen. he played his role (geoffrey) very convincingly. bruce willis' role (james cole) was also quite convincing. both bruce willis and brad pitt acted extraordinarily well. with the brilliant story to back the great performances; and to back that up, terry gilliam's superb directing.
