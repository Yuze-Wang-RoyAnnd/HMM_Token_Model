"spin it!"<br /><br />the 90s opened up with a clever disney favorite, "talespin," the tv cartoon series that featured characters from "the jungle book." join baloo and kit cloudkicker as they fly the sea duck like you've never seen it before: out of cape suzette, to louie's, up mountains, through jungles, on water, in volcanoes, looking for adventure, looking for treasure, looking for fun, all in one action-packed cartoon adventure!!!!!<br /><br />this was a favorite of mine as well as my family's. this ran on the disney afternoon the entire first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the old disney channel in 1995, which i have seen on vacation once in 1996 before getting cable in march 1997.<br /><br />and good news: today the dvds are here!!!!! relive the fun and excitement of "dun, dun, dun, talespin!!!!!"<br /><br />10/10
