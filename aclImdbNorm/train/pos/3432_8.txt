this is one of those landmark films which needs to be situated in the context of time.darkness in tallinn was made in 1993.it was a period of chaos,confusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary denizens of estonia but also for countless citizens of other former nations which were a part of mighty soviet empire.it was in such a tense climate that a young country named estonia was born.as newly established governments are known to encounter teething problems,estonia too faced numerous troubles as some corrupt officials manipulated state machinery for filling their dirty pockets by making use of their selfish means.this is one of this film's core themes.darkness in tallinn appears as an estonian film but it was made by a finnish director ilka j"arvilaturi. he has tried his best to infuse as many possible doses of estonian humor.this is why one can call it a comedy film of political undertones.as ordinary people are involved in this film, we can say that this film signifies good versus evil.this is not a new concept as it is readily available in most of the religious books of different faiths.darkness in talinn shows us as to how ordinary governments can also be toppled by corrupt people.a nice film to watch on a sunny day.
