una giornata particolare is a film which has made brilliant use of closed spaces.it is in these dull,empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of ettore scola's two leading characters.marcello mastroianni and sophia loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives.it is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them.all men would really feel sorry for sophia loren's character.all women would surely cry their hearts out at marcello mastroianni's existential plight.disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber,poignant film.most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities.una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women.this is a film for which italian director ettore scola has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction.his idea is to show how the arrival of hitler changed destinies of ordinary italian folks.a word about the courageous personnage played magnificently by great marcello mastroianni.he acts as a real man who does not beg for pity.he happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life.a true masterpiece of cinema !!!
