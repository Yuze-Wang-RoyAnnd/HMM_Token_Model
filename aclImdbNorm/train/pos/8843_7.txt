the humor implicit in the complete title proverb derives from the sunday school dictum that one would be better advised to prepare before you're dead for the devil's scrutiny, i.e. so the devil doesn't care when you're dead. there's no percentage in trying to beat the devil. the characters apparently didn't pay attention at sunday school, and find themselves forced into crisis management, having eschewed crisis avoidance. but even a seasoned ceo would have difficulty managing these crises. throwing dice is far more unpredictable than flipping a coin; when people are involved, the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable sidney lumet films. until now, hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward earning billing among other lumet all stars like steiger and pacino.
