anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist, a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet. is jake (a mesmerizing anthony demarco) simply "transferring" the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image? or could the creature be real? writer/director shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing. her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia.<br /><br />brooke bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry, but loving parents. however it is the creepy minor characters, mrs. bender(barbara gruen), an unhinged babysitter and sam stone (ben bode), a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind. jake's closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.
