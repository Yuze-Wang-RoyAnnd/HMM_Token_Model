imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends 8 year's of his life, and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself! the murder technique is clear, but a government unwilling to admit the truth let's a monster destroy dozens of lives. when i think my job is stressful, i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick. the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea. the comic (and almost tragic at times) relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years. the catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat. while not nearly as well advertised and talked about as "silence of the lamb's", the plot was just as suspenseful. rent or buy this movie today!
