the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is "beauty". beauty is all around, in actors' play (andie is superb as always), in well designed shots, and in authors' red line idea - the love.<br /><br />i think the kenny's character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life. his interaction makes andie's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be. when he's gone, it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires.<br /><br />the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad, instead it shows that life prevails in any forms, even in this small british village, which is shown perfectly.<br /><br />another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways - all that houses and "fags" and accents :))). and andie again is doing superb job! it is a shame that this movie got such low marks. 10 out of ten!
