the case of the scorpion's tail is a highly stylish giallo directed by sergio martino, who appears to be a giallo master second only to dario argento.<br /><br />ernesto gastaldi wrote this fabulous who-dunnit, quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery. it also makes sense in the end, a big plus, 'cause that's not always the case for these giallo's, as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red-herrings and ultimate solutions. here, the less you know about the plot, the better.<br /><br />pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography, the catchy music score, the gorgeous females (anita strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few.<br /><br />in most parts it's decently acted, goerge hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well. martino directs with a sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces.<br /><br />if you're a giallo fan, this is a must see. if you like well written and suspenseful thrillers in general, this comes highly recommended.
