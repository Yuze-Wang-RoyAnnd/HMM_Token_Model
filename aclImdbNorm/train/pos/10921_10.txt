after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin (i bought it on dvd, hence the "spin" pun...i'm a dork). the beginning was everything i hoped for, a perfect set-up (along with some quotes that i've heard on various wu-tang albums) to what should have been a good movie. but the plot i heard was so great, was so predictable. every time i saw a character (except for the lizard) i guessed which venom he was. plus, the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie. ok, so the plot wasn't very good but at least there was some good kung-fu right? wrong. the fights were very short and few and far between. granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer. i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened. i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened. i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened. in short, not much happens. the fighting is all pretty routine. don't be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot, it does not mean it's a good one.
