i think lion king 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever as if not the best out of the three lion king movies! in the movie timon and pumbaa tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as timon having trouble digging tunnels with other meercats! timon and pumbaa journey off into finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also simba who they raise but soon they must choose between their dream place or helping simba face his evil uncle scar and proclaim his right as the lion king of pride rock! filled with wonderful new characters like timon's ma(julie kavner) and uncle max (jerry stiller). i think my favorite character was uncle max because he was very funney and was voiced by a funney comedian jerry stiller the father of ben stiller. disney was smart to cast stiller in that role! filled with wonderful characters, animation, and story and music lion king 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than simba's pride even though i will admit i really did like that one too! lion king 1 1/2 is a great disney sequel the whole family can enjoy! it's got a good story and is very funney! 10 out of 10!
