for everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise. it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. it focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow.<br /><br />that's because sasha, like each superhero, takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it. sasha becomes an outlaw. while on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him.<br /><br />as you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics. it reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by ram gopal varma. everything happens very slowly. however, when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on, it's all over. but the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action. what is more important here is the outcome of sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. the score is very scarce, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. so basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.<br /><br />is the film worth it? that is a question really difficult to answer. i don't think that this experience enriched me so very much, but somehow i keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. mostly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating because all the time sasha and katya have hope. after all they're young people, who have all their lives to live. so no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight joyous tune when they are together.
