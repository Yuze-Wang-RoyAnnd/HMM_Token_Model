as perhaps one of the few canadians who did not read the book in high school, i thought i would add my comments. seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film. the characters have so many complexities, everyone can relate to them in their own way. the brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters, rather than being spoon-fed an opinion. you can love them or dislike them, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. wonderful performances by ellen burstyn and christine horne really bring the characters to life. i'd highly recommend it.
