pialat films people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. in la gueule ouverte, he's dealing with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son as she dies of cancer. in a nos amours, the teenage girl's sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family. here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex-con. her motivation is a little cloudy, since loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than tv shows; on the other hand, he's got a fabulous body (i wonder why depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physique--he would have been great as a rugby player).<br /><br />the casting is impressive. isabelle huppert isn't allowed to give a bland, inexpressive performance (she has given many); depardieu plays loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want--see the scene in the bar, where he's stabbed in the gut, runs away and seeks treatment, then soon restarts with nelly. guy marchand, with those coal-black eyes and distressed look, plays nelly's husband beautifully; it's a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de foudre.
