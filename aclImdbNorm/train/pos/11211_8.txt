i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst. the gorilla looks just terrific, and the eyes were especially lifelike. it's even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top. rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine. usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw-man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla. it's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we do, and yet how we really can't treat them just like people because they aren't. not many films venture into this territory and it's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity.
