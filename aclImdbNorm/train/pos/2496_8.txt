no rubbish - no where even near rubbish. not an original? thats the last thing that could be said of "2.4 children".predictable? certainly not! although it was somewhat an unusual series for the bbc, it was hilarious, funny, and witty. i particularly liked belinda lang and john pickard - who i believe preformed wonderfully.gary olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members..i never quite new why it was can-celled till reading here today about gary olsen's death at a relatively young age. i do wish that they would make more of comedy of this type, much more of them (and show them here in israel).thumbs way up!
