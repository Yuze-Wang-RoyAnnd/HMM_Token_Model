as alan rudolph's "breakfast of champions" slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordon's "mother night" came out. now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being "unfilmable" it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments (the other being "slaughter-house five"). "mother night" is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why. it's brilliant! it stays almost entirely faithful to vonnegut's book (without being stilted or overly literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic. how many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that? vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that? not only is it a beautiful film, it is a beautifully acted, written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s. it's a mournful, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. i would sincerely encourage anyone to see "mother night" - it doesn't even take a familiarity with vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as "slaughter-house five" sometimes does). it is a powerful, affecting piece of cinema.
