the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way (note that this change need not be positive or beneficial) at the end.<br /><br />by that measure, enchanted april is a resounding success. as a film in general, it succeeds quite well-excellent ensemble cast, well-developed characters you come to care about, wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations. in short the film is, well, enchanting. although all the performances are first-rate, three must be mentioned-josie lawrence, jim broadbent and joan plowright. it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast. most highly recommended, particularly if you are a romantic at heart. further deponent saith not.
