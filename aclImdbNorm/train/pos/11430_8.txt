unfortunately, because of us viewers' tendency to shun subtitles, this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits. its subtle themes of belonging, identity, racial relations and especially how colonialism harms all parties, transcend the obvious dramatic tensions, the nostalgic memories of the protaganiste's childhood, and the exoticism of her relationship with her parents' "houseboy," perhaps the only "real" human she knows. we won't even look at her mother's relationship with this elegant man. there! i hope i've given you enough of a hook to take it in, whether you speak french or like subtitles or not. i challenge you to be as brave, strong and aware as la p'tite.
