saw this movie at the vancouver film festival and thought it was deadly smart, stylish, and funny.<br /><br />the cast was rock solid. great work by carrie anne moss, dylan baker, tim blake nelson, billy connelly and up and comer, alexia fast.<br /><br />weirdly, i found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it.<br /><br />writers, dennis heaton, robert chomiak and andrew currie layered in a lot of political subtext - but didn't whack you over the head with it.<br /><br />the world they created had depth, and made sense. there is a giddy carnivorous spirit to this movie.<br /><br />fido is guaranteed to cure grumpiness.<br /><br />loved it!!!
