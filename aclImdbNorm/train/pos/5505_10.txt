this is something new.<br /><br />there's a coup d'etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it.<br /><br />a democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc. without repercussion from the governments side (like, say, silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods). oh, and they still claim that they are being suppressed, of course.<br /><br />see how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d'etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals (how much more stupid can you get?? ).<br /><br />and see how the people of venezuela march to the palace, holding the constitution in their hands, and reinstall their elected government.<br /><br />this sounds like a hollywood fairytale, but it happened for real, against the explicit wishes of the usa. the documentary is a historical masterpiece, shot from the center of the action, acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup: the good, democratic, freedom loving, benevolent usa (who still channel large amounts of money to chavez' political opponents).<br /><br />also highly entertaining and exciting. 10 points.
