this is a quirky little movie, and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well.<br /><br />it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist, and is partly about following his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the travails of showbiz. i thought the movie was charming, and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile.<br /><br />alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was, and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationship.<br /><br />not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies about the journey, then i think you'll like this one.
