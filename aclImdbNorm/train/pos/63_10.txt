this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny. if you think of seeing this one for the shootings.. stay clear. this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure. even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do...why? fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with. yes the language is harsh at times, but it suits the characters well. there are some loose ends left or unanswered, but all movies have these. the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents. highly recommended for teens and adults.
