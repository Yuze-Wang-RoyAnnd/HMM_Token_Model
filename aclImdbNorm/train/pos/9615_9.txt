this is a great movie! most of us have seen jurassic park, where the chaos theory is summarized by telling about a butterfly's wings, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. well, bug is all about that (or at least something, don't worry this is no spoiler) i'm definitely not a religious type and don't believe in pre-destined stuff, fate, etc, but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists...<br /><br />further more, the acting and camera are excellent too, another prove that it's still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks
