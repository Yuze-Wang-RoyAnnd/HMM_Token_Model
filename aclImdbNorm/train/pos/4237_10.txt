charleton heston wore one, james franciscus wore one but mark wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth. i hope no one casts him as tarzan. linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but estrella warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way. tim burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at. even the chaste helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain. she's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end. as in artificial intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - planet of the apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints. lisa marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. this movie has three great actors tim roth, ms. carter & paul giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch. superlative make up (a certain oscar) costumes, sets, music make this the hit summer movie of 2001.
