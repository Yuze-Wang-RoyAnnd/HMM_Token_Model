i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year. i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub-titled dramas to help me with my japanese. my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird, but i found it delightful! koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and matsujun's spirit made my day every time i tuned in! i first saw him on "hana yori dango", but i liked him much better in this!<br /><br />although the characters are interesting and well-developed, i was disappointed to find that they didn't change very much throughout the show. their relationship grew, but they didn't really. still, a fun time had by all (even for fukushima!).
