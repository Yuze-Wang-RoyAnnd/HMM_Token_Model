shirley maclaine in another tailor-made role. as the aunt to a single mom in a 1962 working-class chicago neighborhood, the veteran character actress gets another work-out as a gutsy woman who won't let any set-backs defeat her spirit of success. the children, a pre-teen boy and girl, are drawn to their spirited aunt zoe, although the many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her, and applied at all the wrong opportunities eventually get them expelled from school.<br /><br />the plot is cleverly enveloped in the cuban missile crisis, with all of the social implications. men building bomb shelters, people watching news programs on what seemed to be the only tv set, at a diner, and a general mist of uneasiness and fear in the air. when a "harmless" miracle is blown out of proportions, the climactic conclusion nonetheless makes the viewer feel good. yes, virginia, the sun will come up tomorrow! clearly a small-budget production, this is still a sweet little film, filled with the magic that sunday matinees were made of. with a few choice "oldies" thrown into an effective sound track, the whole family is sure to enjoy this one.****
