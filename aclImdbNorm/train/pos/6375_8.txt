while i have a great respect for disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what i would call "must-see". atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, and thankfully lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />atlantis is a more "mature" disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent disney offering. the world of atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached. the presentation of simply atlantis' landscape and setting, without some expendable cheery song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. the inclusion of an atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this, and works fairly well.<br /><br />also, with the exception of some scenes involving mole's practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a "childish" element that i usually associate with disney films. instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to atlantis, and the constant discovery that occurred at atlantis, as milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about. part of this involves the atlantean "weaponry", which is used in a very action-packed climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting.<br /><br />granted, not all of the story makes full sense, and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the toy story movies, this is the most entertaining disney film i've seen in years.
