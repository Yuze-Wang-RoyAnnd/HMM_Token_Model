released two years before i was born, this oscar-winning movie has it all - lavish technicolor sets and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, superb wall-to-wall gershwin music, superior choreography, a lighter-than-air screenplay, and great performances by kelly, levant, foch, guetary, and caron. hollywood doesn't make 'em like this anymore. definitely, this is my favorite movie of all time, a standard by which i judge all other films. enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!
