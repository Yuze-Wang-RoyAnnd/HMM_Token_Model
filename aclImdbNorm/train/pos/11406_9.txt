this very peculiar setting of wagner's last opera definitely grew on me. when i first saw it, i was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images, and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story. however, if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherch'e "gimmicks," i think you will find that the film does manage to capture the very strange, other-worldly atmosphere of the opera, and that there are moments which are particularly fine.<br /><br />personally, i never really understood the role of kundry until i saw how edith clever portrayed her. her performance (a lip-synchronized mime of the singing voice of yvonne minton) is nothing short of dazzling, from end to end, and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film.<br /><br />another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of robert lloyd of the crucial role of gurnemanz, one which lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world. i have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of gurnemanz on the stage of the metropolitan opera several times, and the lusciousness of his voice, and the warm, fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved, as did his performance in the character's two major monologues, the karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in act 1.<br /><br />the version i have seen was a videotape made for america, and so there were subtitles which, alas, could not be done away with. this is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera. this seemed to me to be quite contrary both to wagner's clear avoidance of christianity, and his very deliberate attempt to "generalize" the christian elements of the story. (see footnote with spoiler at the end of this review.) i find it nearly impossible, when viewing a film with subtitles, to keep from absorbing them, and strongly recommend that, if in the dvd versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off, you do so, and instead, if the opera is unfamiliar to you, that you read the libretto carefully beforehand.<br /><br />the bottom line is that there is much in the film which i dislike, and would just as soon have seen done differently...but it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since i first saw it, and i find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again.<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________<br /><br />footnote containing a spoiler: a good example would be kundry's famous line, "i saw him...him...and laughed." this gets translated, in the subtitles, for reasons which escape me, as "i saw the savior's face." it is especially irritating to me, because throughout the libretto, wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character who need not be the biblical jesus as "der heiland," i.e., the german for "the healer"--a reference to the wound of amfortas, and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing.
