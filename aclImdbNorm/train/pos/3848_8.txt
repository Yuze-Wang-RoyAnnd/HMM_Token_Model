gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination. he is also homosexual and catholic prone to catholic guilt and something of a clairvoyant, or so it seems. on a trip to flushing he is 'seduced' by christine. when he discovers that christine's new boyfriend is the bit of rough trade he's been fancying from afar he decides to stick around. after all, enforced heterosexuality has its compensations. then he realizes that christine's previous three husbands have all died violent deaths. did christine murder them and is he or the boyfriend, herman, going to be 'the fourth man'? verhoeven's overheated, over-egged melodrama is a delicious blend of hitchcock and david lynch, full of ott eroticism and religious imagery and an awful lot of the colour red. a lot of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or a figment of gerard's imagination. the fun is in figuring it out. also the fact that christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the priggish gerard or the bullish herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her. in fact, it's fair to say gerard's comeuppance can't come soon enough. super performances, too, from jeroen krabbe and renee soutendijk and easily verhoeven's best film up to his wonderfully subversive piece of sci-fi "starship troopers".
