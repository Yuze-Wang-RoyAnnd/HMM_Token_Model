i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of 2007. i am absolutely crazy about the show. i think the entire cast is excellent. it's one of my favorite show ever. i just checked the abc program lineup for this fall and did not see it on the schedule. that is really sad. i hope they will bring it back ... maybe they are waiting until bridget moynahan has her baby? or is it only my wishful thinking? <br /><br />i read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks, similar to mine. i certainly hope that abc will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up.
