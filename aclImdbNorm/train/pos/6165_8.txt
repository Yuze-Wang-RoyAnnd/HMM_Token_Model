yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and the bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is actually an engrossing show, that i try not to miss. a vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is fairly good, though i do miss roberta taylor as inspector gina gold and todd carty as gabriel kent. i will admit, i prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as i found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. still, why i like the bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable. it is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but i really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 bethany cox
