i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable. the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn. in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (perhaps for sex as well, but not on indian tv, anyway.)<br /><br />not being a fan of the genre i couldn't place jeff wincott, and had no leads to search from. only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on her.<br /><br />this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90's couture or nod-and-wink schlock `a la paul verhoeven. can we add a genre tag for "so-bad-it's-good"?
