this is the epitome of fairytale! the villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure. danes, deniro,and pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of tristan. outstanding performances, delightful magic, funny and dramatic, and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous! i'm not so sure all content is appropriate for younger children but for an older audience, there are plenty of hilarious subtleties! the previews do not do this movie justice! my fianc'e and i were quite skeptical but were so thrilled we had taken a chance on this movie that i can only hope to assure anyone on the fence about this movie to give it a try!
