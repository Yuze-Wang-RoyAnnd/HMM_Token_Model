jean harlow and clark gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie together.<br /><br />yes, hold your man can be cheesy and predictable, but that's not what i love about the movie. i love seeing harlow and gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful. it is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful film.<br /><br />the witty dialogue, great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie. i loved this movie the first time i saw it and on each subsequent viewing i always notice at least one new detail. to me, that is a mark of a great film.<br /><br />the dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period (early 30's). i adore classic movies, but i admit that most of them are just average and at times don't hold my interest. hold your man is one of the exceptions.<br /><br />this has a lot to do with the fact that hold your man is a 'pre-code' movie. (the hays code was not enforced until a year after hold your man.) this movie could not have been made under the code. well, it could have been made, but it would have been an entirely different story. thank goodness the code was not enforced until 1934. otherwise, we would have missed out on this gem.
