i'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals. whatever the case, i'm sure i loved it. from the wonderfully twisted, lurid, intertwining stories, to the deliciously sinister performances from robert stack and dorothy malone, to the vivid, gaudy colour with which it's all captured, this is high-class trash and it's great fun. not to mention the amusingly sly and thinly veiled sexual subtexts which permeate the entire film, always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so. i'd be lying if i said that the film's sheer entertainment value didn't contribute to my love for it, but there's some sort of bizarre artistry behind the unintentional (or was it?) comedy and i really, really dug that. i could really get into this melodrama stuff.
