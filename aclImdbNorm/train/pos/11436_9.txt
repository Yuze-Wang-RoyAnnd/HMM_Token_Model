this is the kind of picture john lassiter would be making today, if it weren't for advances in cgi. and that's just to say that he'd be forgotten, too, if technology hadn't made things sexy and kewl since 1983. _twice..._ has got the same wit, imagination, and sense of real excitement that you'd find in a pixar flick, only executed under the restrictions of the medium c. 1983. innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels. it should be spoken of in the same breath with _spiritited away_ and _toy story_.
