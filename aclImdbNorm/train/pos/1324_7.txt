you sit there for a half an hour and watch a story, believing it all, then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling... and then put back together again. brilliant.<br /><br />one of the most exciting feature films at the san francisco international film festival is a documentary. i don't know if - other than andrew jarecki's "capturing the friedmans" - there has ever been anything like anna broinowski's "forbidden lie$." it features, exposes, defends, reveals, and questions everything about norma khouri, author of "honor lost," the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings in jordan.<br /><br />what is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this "exposure" of khouri is made with khouri's full participation.<br /><br />for the initial portion of the film, khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in amman, the story of the book. she sounds completely believable, convincing.<br /><br />then her story is taken apart, exposed, by eminently believable and convincing people, such as women's rights activists in jordan, investigative reporters there and in australia, where khouri lived for a while.<br /><br />khouri comes back and denies the accusations, taking a successful lie-detector test in the process. there comes another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value... and then khouri comes back and faces the accusations (not all, but the essential ones in the matter of the book).<br /><br />and the houdini act continues, with round after round in this heavy-weight, seesaw prize fight, surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of resolution. brilliant.
