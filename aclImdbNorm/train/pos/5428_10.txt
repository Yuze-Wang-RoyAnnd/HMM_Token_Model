my favorite "imperialism" movie and one of the best action-adventure flicks of all time. grant, mclaglen and fairbanks dominate the screen with daring-do and wise cracks to please all but the most "pc" of film goers. memorable scenes abound -- the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting off hundreds of thugs; macchesney & cutter giving bobby coote the spiked punch ("save some for the elephant"); cutter to macchesney -- "i'm an expedition"; din breaking cutter out of jail, with a fork ("what do you think i'm trying to break out of? a bleedin' pudding?!) and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing, bold as brass -- "all right, you're all under arrest!"<br /><br />i could go on, but suffice it to say i try to catch this film whenever it is on. for armchair adventurers and generals, it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours.
