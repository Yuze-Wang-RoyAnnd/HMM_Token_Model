this movie surprised me! not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much! the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style! normally i am very careful when this is claimed! there is only one john woo and til this day there hasn't been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action! the fact that "moon child" would feature a vampire convinced me even more! how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires! sounds promising and interesting! the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow! it takes it's time to set the mood! this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes! but "moon child" isn't an action movie! it is a drama about friendship and loyalty! the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other! the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends! the only problem i had was with the plot! a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip! example:when one member of the gang dies (very dramatic moment) alexander wang sees kei (hyde) drinking blood of one of the attackers! without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most of the friends aren't together anymore! also without a proper reason given son (alexander wang) and sho (gackt) have to kill each other! i know that this is done to add some serious drama! because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced! apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie! it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! but it just is! the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere!
