this is a good film for 99% of the duration. i feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim.<br /><br />it is shot in a rather naive fashion. this is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique.<br /><br />the gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the 'nutcase' called joe. however, the wholesome (normal) characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted, they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little ott.<br /><br />the film starts slowly (and the naive camera work smacks of 'b' movie to start with) and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur. this is one of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold-hearted violence.<br /><br />after the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending i was left feeling disappointed. i would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail-biting scenes earlier on in the film.<br /><br />give it a watch and excuse the ending!
