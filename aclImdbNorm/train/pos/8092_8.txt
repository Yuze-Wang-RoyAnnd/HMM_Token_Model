i happened upon this movie as an 8-10 year old on a cold, dark november afternoon. i was outside playing all day, freezing, and when i came in around 4pm, i had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the tv with a blanket. i was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasn't all happy and silly--and was in fact dark, and moralistic. it captured my imagination. i'm sure it misses the text, and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the tolkien purist. but it still captures the spirit of the story, the choice to carry a burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfish, rash decisions, etc. the quality of animation leaves room for complaint. but the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations. john hurt is great in this. if you don't like how the character is drawn, look away, and just listen to him. his voice is extraordinary. i've seen it again many, many times and it always brings me back to that time, as a kid, thirsty for some magical adventure. it's for this reason i say 'lucky', the film is nostalgic for me so i overlook its shortcomings. but between john hurt, and tolkien's fantasy, it still reached me, and still does.
