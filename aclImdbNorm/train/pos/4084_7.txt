i guess this is meant to be a sort of reworking or updating of "beauty and the beast", but i can't say i've ever watched a movie that began with several minutes of graphic horse sex. wow. anyway it seems that a young woman and her..aunt? have traveled to this castle in france where the woman is to be married to the son of the castle owner, who is the man who takes care of making sure the horses get their rocks off. it seems that there are legends in that area of a beast that was rather, uh, frisky, i guess you could say, with the ladies, or at least, one in particular. there are all kinds of references tucked away in that regard but every time the soon-to-be-blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one the groom's father removes it from her sight. anyway, the young bride-to-be goes upstairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a cardinal to show up to the wedding (a family member, i guess) and as she dreams she dreams of a beast in the woods that has its way with her. the effects in this leave a little to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (not that i know much about that) is kind of rendered laughable, especially when certain featured appendages appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat. this has a rather strange and abrupt, yet twist ending, with not really any clues or much build up to it, but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what i expected. i don't know, this is kind of a tough one to get through but it has its moments and is definitely weird. 7 out of 10.
