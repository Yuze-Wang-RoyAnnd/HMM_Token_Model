'stanley and iris' show the triumph of the human spirit. for stanley, it's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential. for iris, it's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together, starting and stopping, before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on. in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is, thus being credible. unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture. the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances. all in all an excellent movie. the best thing i take from it is hope.
