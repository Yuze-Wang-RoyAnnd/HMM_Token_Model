this movie is incredible. if you have the chance, watch it. although, a warning, you'll cry your eyes out. i do, every time i see it, and i own it and have watched it many times. the performances are outstanding. it deals with darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. this movie made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience, according to my english teacher. also, if you've seen it, note the interesting use of shadows and light. home room is a phenomenal movie, and i rate it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting, amazing plot, and heart-wrenching dialogue. very tense, very moving. doesn't give all the answers, but makes many good points about humankind
