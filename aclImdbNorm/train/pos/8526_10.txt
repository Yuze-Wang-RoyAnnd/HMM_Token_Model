i loved this movie! chris showerman did an amazing job! not only is he an incredible actor, but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique! he did a great job on the delivery of his lines, plus transformed into george better than fraser did. a great performance for his first major roll! this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. my kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the dvd the day it came out. in addition to the movie, the extras on the dvd are just as hilarious. two thumbs up on this one! i highly recommend it to everyone!
