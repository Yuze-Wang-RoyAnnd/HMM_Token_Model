i.q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. if you ask me, james (stephen fry) really was a dull guy. to me, ed (tim robbins) was more suited for catherine (meg ryan) than james was. anyway, everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job. now, in conclusion, i highly recommend this sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any tim robbins or meg ryan fan who hasn't seen it. you're in for lots of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
