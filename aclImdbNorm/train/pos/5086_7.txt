when i heard patrick swayze was finally returning to his acting career with king solomon's mines i was very excited. i was expecting a great indiana jones type action adventure. what i got was a 4 hour long (with commercials) epic that was very slow. the second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it. the ending was good (no spoilers here)but i was still left wanting more. well all a guy can do is prey that swayze does "roadhouse 2" so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous. until than if your a fan of king solomon's mines than read the book or watch the 1985 version with richard chamberlain and sharon stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of 4 hours.
