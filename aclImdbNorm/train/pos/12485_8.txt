i just watched this movie and have to say, i was very impressed. it's very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat! i had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! if i had to criticise, i'd say that perhaps if anything, there were too many jump moments. it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect, because you kind of new what was coming.<br /><br />although it contains virtually every clich'e in the ghost genre, they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy, fear-factor. it had elements of the shining, the 6th sense and the changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of the changeling).<br /><br />i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare!
