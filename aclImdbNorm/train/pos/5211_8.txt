since their nasty divorce from the disney company (with disney keeping the miramax brand) the weinstein company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few. the flock is a prime example.<br /><br />a story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of law and order - svu.<br /><br />richard gere gives his best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task. claire danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in) and she makes the most of playing the novice. the cinematography, pacing, editing, all of it is first rate --- and i saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around or excess camera cuts that others complained about. the subject is handled with restraint, but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick.<br /><br />fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded. then came the supreme court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the "rights" of sex perverts were opened up and america was turned into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversity, both willing and unwilling. each such step was met with praise by liberals, who celebrated the warren court's ill deeds with glossy covers on time and newsweek. everyday liberals also praised the court's action and mocked those who disagree. in 2007 how many americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to, and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the us post office. just one part of the problem -- a problem that can tare anyone's family to shreds.<br /><br />richard gere is a liberal, but he gives his best in his performance here. perhaps in his maturing age he's gained a measure of wisdom.
