i managed to tape this off my satellite, but i would love to get an original release in a format we can use here in the states. eddie truly is glorious in this performance from san francisco. i don't remember laughing so hard at a stand up routine. my wife and i both enjoyed this tape and his work on glorious i just wish i could buy a copy and help support eddie financially through my purchase. we need more of his shows available.
