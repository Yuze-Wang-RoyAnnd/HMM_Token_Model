i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long. it brings out the child in everyone. i mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment? louis sachar thats who. although the movie was different from the book it was still very good. for example caveman/stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there. weight wise and height wise but zigzag/ricky was taller and armpit/theodore was bigger. also x-ray/rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn't. the only thing that i didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long. i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion. i especially like the work of the boys though. like squid/alan who was played by jake m.smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid. jake m.smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes. so i would say if you havent seen holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you'll be missing out on a whole lotta fun.
