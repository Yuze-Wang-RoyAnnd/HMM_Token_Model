<br /><br /> what can i say? this is one of the most perfect films ever made. its a throwback to the glitxy,sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s..but with a modern touch.the screenplay bursts with wit,charm,humor and tenderness,the cinematograpy is breathtaking(nyc never looked so beautiful),and of course there is the cast! dudley moore turns in the performance of his career as loveable,drunken arthur bach. he is also wistful and real..one of the film's best lines is his poignant "not everyone who drinks is a poet...some of us drink because we're not poets." the great sir john gielgud won a much deserved oscar for his splendid performance as hobson,arthur's valet and caretaker.although he considered it a "take the money and run role",he brings to the character all the talent ,experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian. the supporting cast is also out of thisworld,from geraldine fitzgerald's sassy grandma bach to stephen elliott's bombastic mafioso.<br /><br /> the score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly.the only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned.
