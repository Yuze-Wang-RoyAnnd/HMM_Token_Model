let's keep it simple: my two kids were glued to this movie. it has its flaws from an adult perspective, but buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it. <br /><br />and the pepsi girl was excellent!<br /><br />and kimberly williams was pretty gosh-darned hot, although she's not in the film very much, so don't get too excited there.<br /><br />not that's it's really a bad thing, but it is the kind of movie you watch just once. don't buy the dvd.<br /><br />enjoy!<br /><br />did i mention kimberly williams? (that was for the dads.)
