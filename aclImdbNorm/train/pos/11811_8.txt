dick tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by chester gould. he is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a crew of villains, ranging from all types of visually original characters such as flattop to the blank to big boy caprice. (these villains became so popular in the 40's that warner bros. created their own take on the tracy-style villains in such cartoons as daffy duck) tracy's comics were known for their liberal use of gunplay and the up-to-date technology advances (notably the wristwatch communicator), which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent movie. the music was done wonderfully by danny elfman, and the original songs by madonna were interesting, but they were not the high point for her career. it's weird because as you watch the film and see the suspenseful moments, the film feels so much like batman because of elfman's memorable sound to his pieces.<br /><br />i love the tough-talking kid, pacino's acting as big boy caprice (and that chin!), madonna's take on villainy, and the cinematography and directing were impeccable. this film was very professionally made and features tons of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this film was made (warren beatty, al pacino, william forsythe, dustin hoffman, kathy bates, mandy patinkin, catherine o'hara, dick van dyke). the film was directed by beatty himself, which was interesting. it is almost like beatty saw himself as tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the part.<br /><br />i had to give this film an 8/10 for everything that it brought to cinema that got overlooked (for whatever reason). there have been tons of misunderstandings over the rating of this movie on imdb, and i still don't understand why. the characters were completely original and vibrant, as was the style of the sets, wardrobe, lighting, and everything in this film. go buy it today. you will not be sorry.
