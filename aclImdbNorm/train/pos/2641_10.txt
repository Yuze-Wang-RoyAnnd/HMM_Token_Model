green eyes is a great movie. in todays context of supporting our troops, it is interesting this movie showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty, during this period. from a historical view, the end of the vietnam war left all of us with something to remember and learn from. gene was very proud of this movie, and he deserved the credits he received from writing "green eyes". i agree, i do not understand why this movie is not shown more often, or at all. this movie is the kind of movie that should be shown on tv every year, much like the wizard of oz. the dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving. i was a friend of gene logans and i was proud to know him. rocky
