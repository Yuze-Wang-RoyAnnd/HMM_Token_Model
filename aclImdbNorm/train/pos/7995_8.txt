here's a gritty, get-the-bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough denzel washington. he's three personalities here: a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge.<br /><br />the story is about washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little american girl living in mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the movie.) he becomes attached to the kid, played winningly by the child actress of our day, dakota fanning. when fanning is kidnapped in front of him, washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one. beware: this film is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />this is stylish film-making, which is good and bad. i liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera-work is one that could give you a headache. i thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view, but it's (the shaky camera) not for all tastes.<br /><br />besides the two stars, there is the always-interesting christopher walken, in an uncharacteristically low-key role, and a number of other fine actors.<br /><br />the film panders to the base emotions in all of us, but it works.
