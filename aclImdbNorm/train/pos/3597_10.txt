(spoilers)<br /><br />i was blown away by this movie. i've been renting on movielink for a bit, and decided to check this movie out. alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood. in this movie, it shows it at the amature level. though i do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades. the movie points out the problems some families face with gender.<br /><br />i was a bit concerned with the ending. but the ending wasn't a disappointment either.<br /><br />i think it was pretty clear by the title that she'd win. what was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end.<br /><br />loved the score for some of the scenes. highly recommended.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />quality: 9/10<br /><br />entertainment: 10/10<br /><br />replayable: 10/10
