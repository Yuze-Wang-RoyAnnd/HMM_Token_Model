i found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one. altman's touch with zooms in and out were there, and i expected those devices to comment on characters and situations. unfortunately, as far as i could see, they sometimes were gratuitous, sometimes witty, often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection. in particular, two zoom-outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed. to be fair, though, a few zooms (outs and ins) to branagh heightened his character's increasing bewilderment, a la pudgy mccabe's or philip marlow's. on the whole, the zooms were, well, inconsistent, and sometimes even trite.<br /><br />other almanesque devices, such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject, succeeded in suggesting characters' sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge. car windshields, house windows, and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently, i felt, harking back to the player and even the long goodbye. a few catchy jump-cuts, especially to a suggestive tv commercial, reminded me of such usage in short cuts, to sardonic effect.<br /><br />but finally, the mismatch between altman's very personal style and the sheer weight of the grisham-genre momentum, failed to excite me. this director's 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres, including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways; this time around, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre. was he muzzled in by mammonist producers, perhaps? or am i missing something, due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here?<br /><br />nonetheless, the casting was excellent all around: tom berenger (for his terrifying ferality), branagh for his (deflated) hubris, robert downey jr's pheromonal haze, robert duvall's method of trash, and davidtz's lurking femme-fatality were near perfect choices all. and except for a few slips out of georgia into chicago on the part of (brunette?) daryl hannah, accents were convincingly southern.<br /><br />suspense and mood were engrossing, even if the story didn't quite rivet viewers. the moodiness of a coastal pre-hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely, painstakingly rendered--i felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto.<br /><br />torn, in the end i judged it a 7.<br /><br />
