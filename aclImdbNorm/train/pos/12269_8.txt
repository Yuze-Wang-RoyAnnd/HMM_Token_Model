four macho rough'n'tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote woodland area to hunt for a bear. the motley coed group runs afoul of crazed vietnam veteran jesse (an effectively creepy portrayal by alberto mejia baron), who not surprisingly doesn't take kindly to any strangers trespassing on his terrain. director/co-writer pedro galindo iii relates the gripping story at a steady pace, creates a good deal of nerve-rattling tension, and delivers a fair amount of graphic gore with the brutal murder set pieces (a nasty throat slicing and a hand being blown off with a shotgun rate as the definite gruesome splatter highlights). the capable cast all give solid performances, with especially praiseworthy work by pedro fernandez as the nice, humane nacho, edith gonzalez as the feisty alejandra, charly valentino as the amiable charly, and tono mauri as antagonistic jerk mauricio. better still, both yummy blonde marisol santacruz and lovely brunette adriana vega supply some tasty eye candy by wearing skimpy bathing suits. antonio de anda's slick, agile cinematography, the breathtaking sylvan scenery, pedro plascencia's robust, shuddery, stirring score, the well-developed characters, and the pleasingly tight'n'trim 76 minute running time further enhance the overall sound quality of this bang-up horror/action hybrid winner.
