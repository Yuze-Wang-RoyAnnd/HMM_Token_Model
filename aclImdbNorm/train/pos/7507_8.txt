greetings again from the darkness. mary heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. her previous "i shot andy warhol" and "american psycho" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. although "the notorious bettie page" is obviously about ms. page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.<br /><br />the film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. the grainy b&w film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in miami beach through the photos of bunny yeager is very well done.<br /><br />the supporting cast is strong with david strathairn (fresh off his edward r. murrow role), chris bauer (as irving klaw) and lili taylor. the star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked gretchen mol. ms. mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. she was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen, jason alexander directed "just looking" in 2000. here she is the notorious bettie page. her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. she really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from tennessee could become the underworld pin-up queen.<br /><br />as one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrific. patsy cline and peggy lee are just two of the featured performers. although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. but the magic of gretchen mol and bettie page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on hbo in the near future. now will someone please turn ms. mol into the star she should be?
