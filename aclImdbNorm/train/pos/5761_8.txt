i swear, that zombie was killed like twice, and kept coming back. i gave this movie an 8. let's face it folks, this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying, i.e., a "handy-cam", shot film. hey, hey, hey, welcome to total indy film making. the fact that todd sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents. yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies over and over again, but who really cares? take it for what it is, a fun and gory horror film, one to share with your buds, or to gross out the people you really care about lol. mellow out people, i suppose you all liked hunks of garbage like "titanic" or "twister" instead. peace, and support independent film making!!!
