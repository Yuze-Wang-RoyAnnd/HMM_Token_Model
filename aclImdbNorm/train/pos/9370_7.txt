i had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, i wondered if it was an independent film, and i was correct, but with a good cast i decided to chance it. basically drifter michael williams (nicolas cage) is in the town red rock, wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner wayne brown (pleasantville's j.t. walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle). he does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. when wayne knows his real identity, he chases michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with lyle from dallas (dennis hopper). but things get complicated when michael realises lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a quick retreat. he goes back to suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. before they leave however, suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe. of course things aren't going to go smoothly, and wayne and lyle catch up to them, and lyle forces them and now tied-up wayne to go and get the buried money. in the end, lyle and wayne both get what they deserve, michael and suzanne do get on a moving train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets what she deserves too. also starring craig reay as jim, vance johnson as mr. johnson, timothy carhart as deputy matt greytack, dwight yoakam as truck driver and robert apel as howard. the performances, apart from maybe a lame boyle, are all fine and dandy, and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. very good!
