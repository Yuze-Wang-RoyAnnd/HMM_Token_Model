the thing about my folks is a wonderful film about relationships - first and foremost an adult son and his father, but also that son with his wife, his sisters and his mother. paul reiser has written a semi-autobiographical movie about his relationship with his father. the movie is funny, poignant and thought-provoking. it led me to re-evaluate my own relationship with both my now-deceased father and my adult son. peter falk is excellent as paul's father - the role could not have been better cast. i hope that both mr. falk and mr. reiser are recognized in next year's movie awards for their efforts - falk for his performance and reiser for his script.
