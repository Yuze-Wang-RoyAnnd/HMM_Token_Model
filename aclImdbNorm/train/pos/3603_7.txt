"girlfight" is much more of a coming-of-age-story than it is a fight flick. and what a relief to have one in an urban school, with naturalistic, realistic latinos and believable use of brooklyn project settings. <br /><br />it made me realize that virtually all hollywood high school movies are set in luxurious suburbia or small towns. (even the somewhat comparable "love and basketball" which focused on teen african-americans was set in suburbia.) while these kids share some of the same peer problems, those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids, where high school graduation could be the major accomplishment of their lives.<br /><br />the feminist element here is riveting in its originality, as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship--and a victory-- on her terms. a lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a gender-bending-expectations situation.<br /><br />the movie does drag a bit here and there, but this is no cheap thrills "rocky" fight movie, as the practices and fights have complex outcomes, and all the relationships--especially with fathers and father-figures-- take more center stage than the center ring. <br /><br />there were lots of interesting music credits listed at the end, but i hadn't really noticed the songs.<br /><br />(originally written 10/7/2000)
