if the themes of the girl from missouri sound familiar it should. that's because anita loos who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic gentlemen prefer blondes. unlike marilyn monroe in that film, jean harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means.<br /><br />and it's men of means that jean harlow is after. she leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather because she's decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it. her talents as a chorus girl are limited, but she'll be able to trade in on that beauty.<br /><br />her odyssey starts with her and friend patsy kelly getting an invitation to perform at a party thrown by millionaire lewis stone. but unbeknownst to jean, stone's just having a wild last fling before doing himself because of the moneys he owes not owns. still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire lionel barrymore notices. <br /><br />lionel's amused by it until jean sets her sights on his playboy son, franchot tone. after that he is not amused and he looks to shake jean from climbing the family tree.<br /><br />the girl from missouri went into production mid adaption of the code so it went under peculiar censorship. i've a feeling we would have seen a much more risqu'e film. still jean harlow as a younger and sassier version of mae west is always appreciated. what a great comic talent that woman had, seeing the girl from missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later.<br /><br />ironically enough the casting of patsy kelly with harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde, thelma todd. harlow and kelly have the same easy chemistry between that patsy had with thelma. todd would also die a year later in a freak accident/suicide/homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given. <br /><br />don't miss the girl from missouri, it's bright and sassy, must be from all that sparkling jewelry.
