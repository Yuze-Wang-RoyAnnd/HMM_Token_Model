i saw only the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts via netflix (convenient service by the way). all in all, i liked this lighthearted, sometimes genre challenged, mini series. the story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine. yes, it does have some romance clich'es of running in the rain or a train station goodbye, but the characters have a chance to be explored so it doesn't seem cheesy, like it would be if this were some tom hanks vehicle or similar. robson greene, who at times reminds me of a separated-at-birth scott bakula does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series into watchable fare. personally, i think the series could have been done with two episodes, but that's up for debate i suppose. apparently, there's a sequel, and that should be arriving tomorrow via netflix.
