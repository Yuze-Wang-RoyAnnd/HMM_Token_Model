i thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter, the impossible planet, and was slightly worried that the second part wouldn't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past 2 who series. but thankfully my fears were unfounded as i found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one. anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the ood, whom have become the devil's pawn. there is also a bit of philosophizing on the doctor's part in the episode that i quite enjoyed. needless to say it was a good solid doctor who story. might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though.<br /><br />my grade: b+
