superb comic farce from paul mazursky, richard dreyfuss, plays jack noah a fairly successful actor- who is on location shooting a film in a fictitious latin american banana republic parador,ruled by the fascist, alfonse sims who unfortunately has succumbed of a heart attack after indulging in too many local cocktails! raul julia plays the oily chief of police who forces the reluctant noah to impersonate the just deceased dictator who noah bears a remarkable resemblance, sonia braga plays the dictator's glamorously lusty mistress, who gives noah a few lessons in how to 'act' like a dictator, jonathan winter's literally rounds off the cast as a cia man in parador posing as a hammock salesman. can noah win over the people of parador? and hold off the rebels? and give the performance of a lifetime without losing his in the process? sammy davis jnr,has a cameo as himself who amusingly croons the national anthem of parador as well as begin the beguine, frog number one(fernando rey pops up as a kindly servant, charo is also on hand as a busty maid, the score by maurice jarre,is excellent.
