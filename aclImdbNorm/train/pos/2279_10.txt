before this, the flawed "slaughterhouse five" was the best. but this screen adaptation of "mother night" is very true to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intent. thankfully it wasn't hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of "breakfast of champions." another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as i think you do for slaughterhouse five). that's probably true of breakfast of champions also but they did such a bad job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie! nick nolte did an excellent job in this film.
