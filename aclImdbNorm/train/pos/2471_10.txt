i had never read shakespeare's hamlet before watching it but i did have a shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it. my view on the movie may be partially biased since i had never read the play before, but i got pulled into this movie's grasp. shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the story of hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements.<br /><br />but now on to the movie...<br /><br />i found that all the actors in the movie had a firm grasp of what they were saying and thus, were able to articulate it quite well. leonardo in romeo and juliet is nothing compared to kenneth branagh and the king. the thing i liked about this was that it worked very well as a "movie" and not as a play you are studying. you don't need to be affluent with shakespeare to relate to all the misery hamlet has to go through. i would recommend this movie to a wide audience.<br /><br />that's my two cents.
