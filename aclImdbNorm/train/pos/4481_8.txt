the only reason i give this movie 8/10 stars, and not 10, is because 1) sinatra is awful and 2) the love interest of kelly's character leaves much to be desired, (imho). do love that dean stockwell, quantum leap - al, is the little boy. the dance sequence with jerry mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences i have ever seen. tom and jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter's. i'm 28 and she's 4, so while the character is less iconic than mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults today. kelly is as always captivating, his eyes full of fun and excitement. in every movie i have ever seen him in, he always steals the show. one of the best dancers of the 20th century. it is no wonder paula abdul "sampled" kelly's moves. i would also list gene kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. if you were to watch only one part, don't miss kelly's dance with jerry mouse. you will not be disappointed.
