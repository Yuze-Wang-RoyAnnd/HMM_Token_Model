this is why i still have nightmares.<br /><br />this terrifying film (a musical) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s.<br /><br />a boy leaves on a magical journey to an island. the mayor of the island, pufnstuf, allegedly a dragon, looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me, and a magic talking flute are targeted by a witch (billie halliday, who was considered 'a bit of alright' at the time).<br /><br />the flute is recovered at an 'interesting' witches convention, with the witches having a gay old time. the boy dresses in drag then as a 'fairy' to recover the flute.<br /><br />not suitable for children.
