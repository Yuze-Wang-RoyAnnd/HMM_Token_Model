some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most.<br /><br />i thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isn't it?<br /><br />i would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven. david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last house.<br /><br />other than that - worth a look.
