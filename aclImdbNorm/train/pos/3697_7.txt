i caught this movie on the sundance channel on cable one late afternoon. you might say "who loves the sun" is a perfect leisurely pastime of a story, why ever not. you get to hang out with the trio: lukas haas is will (returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago), molly parker is maggie (we learn she's very much part of the family bloom), and adam scott is daniel (is he friend or foe or fianc'e), by the scenic falcon lake, manitoba, canada, captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid summer colors against sunshine and shadows. and supporting the trio are two more family members in the revealing mix: wendy crewson is mom mary bloom, and r.h. thomson is dad arthur bloom. writer-director matt bissonnette has delivered an ingenious unfolding of story-line and its various tentacle links - worry not, haas may have a 'listless' face, but humor will come as parker and scott enter the circle of friends reunited, wry smiles will break and knowing delights stir. dialogs may be terse or even nil, yet we'd get the flavor of what's cooking, bemused or wondering.<br /><br />yes, "who loves the sun" can very well be categorized as a sleeper gem. the chemistry between all five principals sure gels and 'combusts', giving an energetic ensemble performance. after all, it's all in the family, and the film sure doesn't take itself too seriously.<br /><br />looks like the official site is still available at "wholovesthesun.com" and there are information on the soundtrack by mac mccaughan (portastatic with guitar tunes and strings) where score excerpts are being played, and behind the scenes production notes, interview with writer-director-producer bissonnette on how the movie and concept came about, the casting and more. have always appreciate molly parker since her spare yet mesmerizing performance in 1996 lynne stopkewich's 'kissed', and she's married to bissonnette, who "wrote the maggie part for molly."
