this movie is probably for you. it had an overall meditative quality from the music, to the beautiful photography, and listening to the often clich'e things about life that andy goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots. if you're familiar with buddhism- that is the sort of the sense i got out of this film. the impermanence of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnectedness of all things, etc. however, what i did not understand, confused, and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing (i saw over an hour of it) was the redundancy of the whole thing. you only find out bits and pieces of why he's commissioned, and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work. the art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends.
