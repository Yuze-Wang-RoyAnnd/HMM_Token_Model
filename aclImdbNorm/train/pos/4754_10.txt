one of my favorite twilight zone episodes. and the next day we were in the supermarket at hollywood blvd. and la brea, my father and i, and guess who was coming toward us in the aisle! barney phillips, but no hat on -- at least, i don't think he had a hat on.<br /><br />we asked him about his third eye, and he said something like he left it at home, and everybody he met that day had asked him about it.<br /><br />a friendly guy. we used to see all kinds of character actors in la in those days.<br /><br />btw, i was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the "three hands" on the other alien! <br /><br />robyn frisch o'neill <br /><br />hollywood native and resident 1947 to 1963.
