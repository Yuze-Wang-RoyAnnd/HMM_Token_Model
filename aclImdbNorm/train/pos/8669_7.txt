if, unlike some of the commenters here, you are not staging a class war and don't mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful, extroverted, bohemian (gasp) and not being terribly english at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film, closer to euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick american crap... i believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making, i'd defend this, the film isn't any worse as a result, and it puts the spotlight on the cast, some of whom are really good (kate hardie- think that's her name, as the sarcastic drunk is spot-on) the one exception being david baddiel, who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff!! it's light, and we don't go for this kind of anatomising-of-relationship crap in this country, but if you don't have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this.
