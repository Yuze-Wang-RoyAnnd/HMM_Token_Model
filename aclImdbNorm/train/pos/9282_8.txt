in iran, women are not admitted to soccer games. officially it's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. but of course it is about sexism. women are lower forms of human beings.<br /><br />some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks. they are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage, until the police will come and pick them up.<br /><br />despite the insane situation, this is a film with lots of humor. it's also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression. you'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs. good job by director jafar panahi. this is in many ways a heroic comedy.
