"may contain spoilers*<br /><br />"all dogs go to heaven" is a great movie. i saw it in 1989 when i was two years old. i didn't understand it that well but as i saw it more and more times i started to love it. i love the songs in this movie. my favorite songs are "let me be surprised" and "soon you'll come home". those are beautiful songs. the only thing that bothers me about the movie is charlie dieing. when i was little my sister couldn't even watch that part. other than that this movie is wonderful. <br /><br />my favorite part of the movie is when annabelle and charlie are flying around heaven. heaven is beautiful in the movie and the "clocks" are very clever. i also love itchy, in fact i have 3 dachshunds of my own. they are so cute. <br /><br />overall i love this movie and suggest everyone should see it. i give this movie 10/10 stars.
