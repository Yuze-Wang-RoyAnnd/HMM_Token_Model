an excellent family movie... gives a lot to think on... there's absolutely nothing wrong in this film. everything is just perfect. the script is great - it's so... real... such things could happen in everyone's life. and don't forget about acting - it's just awesome! just look at frankie and you'll know what i thought about... this picture is a real can't-miss!!!
