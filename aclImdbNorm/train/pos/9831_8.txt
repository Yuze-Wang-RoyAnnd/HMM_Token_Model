we have high expectations with this one . . . because its zombi 3 the official sequel to zombi 2 and directed by lucio fulci . . . however . . . its co-directed by bruno mattei (from night of the zombies) and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso (night of the zombies) and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies (hell of the living dead) a lot. as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi 2. fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi 2 and its editor tomassi (?) and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi 2 its magic . . . zombi 3 is not magical . . . its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut-butter. but over the years, i've grown to accept zombi 3. i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room . . . there was a senseless fulci-cut and the mattei/fulci-cut is the one on dvd.
