fantastic movie. one to excite all 5 senses. is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. true hollywood conventions used, like playing a list and very attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as naomi watts (julia cook - ned kelly's lover), heath ledger (ned) and orlando bloom (joe byrne - ned's right hand man), and unattractive (sorry geoffrey rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force. this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned (ledger) and julia cook (watts) to entice all the romantics, females being especially susceptible. even from the first scene, when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him "sunshine" and had a "glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder," it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly, the underdog. besides, don't all aussies love an underdog?
