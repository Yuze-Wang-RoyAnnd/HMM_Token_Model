had never heard of the man in the moon until seeing it last evening on this hdtv channel. look, my taste is like any others', eclectic. my favorites run from blue velvet to dr. strangelove to the ghost and mrs. muir thru the wizard of oz and the loved one, eraserhead, repo man, and the spy within.<br /><br />the man in the moon is superbly made, a gentle hearted, joyous and tragic film, beautifully filmed, one in which the actors truly live in the moment rather than act. this sweet tale shortly will be in our private library. this beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting.<br /><br />it's hard to remain stoic during the film's last moments, particularly when the young girl the extent of her older sister's heart searing private pain and forgives all.<br /><br />rather than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose, will end now with this suggestion from one who enjoys films which speak from the heart to ours.<br /><br />if you purchase no other film, please, purchase the man in the moon. this moving story is one you'll enjoy reliving time and again. it is a joy and a gem, a film all too scarce in this world of hardening hearts.<br /><br />the simple virtues evinced in man in the moon are a joy to behold.<br /><br />paul vincent zecchino<br /><br />manasota key, florida<br /><br />05 april, 2009
