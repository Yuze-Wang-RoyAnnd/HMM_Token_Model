we all create our own reality, or do we? that is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality. blending eastern and buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of m.c. escher, this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of `who are we and what is our place in the universe?', and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes. the film centers on bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, `the sea that thinks.' as he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer, writing the screenplay. before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality. director gert de graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. ultimately, de graaff's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be, or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses. note: after you've seen the movie, check out the film's entertaining web site.
