cinderella....<br /><br />i hadn't watched this film for about five years the last time i saw it. the magic remains. there is something that definitely contains that storybook feel, the songs entertain and the secondary character's all please. the villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile. then there is the most magical of all disney, the mice making the dress and well you know the rest. to sum up the four of the disney princess movies are all great but this is a charming magical experience, watch and enjoy. oh and of course, cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie.<br /><br />if you think about it disney movies can really lost their charm. with elene wood and others the movie has such a feel to it, you simply can't help but smile<br /><br />they say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. of course in the real world some are believers others are hoper's. in this film it's even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling. <br /><br />and of course the rest is...cinderella
