when i first went to watch the shining i was expecting a decent film from what i had heard about it and i liked a lot of stanley kubrick's other work but when i started to watch it it was so much better than i thought it would be.at times i seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and i couldn't take my eyes of the screen still there's something very disturbing about everything in the film. now some people don't like kubrick's version of the shining since it doesn't entirely follow stephen king's book but in my opinion both kubrick's version,the mini-series and the book are all great.jack nicholson gives an awesome performance.if you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch the shining.
