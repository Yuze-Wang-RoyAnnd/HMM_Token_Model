i saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. i absolutely loved it. the movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. cillian murphy is extremely creepy as the villain. for those of you who have seen batman begins, his character was much scarier in this film. he played his character very well. the scariest "bad guy," i have seen in awhile. rachel mcadams was great. everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and cheered at the same time, as if we were on cue. the suspense is held through out the movie. the amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. i was not disappointed in the end. i felt satisfied. the trailer does not do the movie justice. the movie is much better than the trailer indicated. do not wait for this movie to come out on video. go see it. although, i did not have to pay to see this movie, i would have gladly given 10.75 to see it. enjoy!
