when i remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it. it was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview, its stunning, and then when it comes out, you hear nothing and totally miss it, and your memory totally doesn't correct the mistake of missing it. man on fire was one of those movies. i was curious on a rental one time, and i decided to take it home with me, my precious blockbuster rental in my hands. i watched it, and witnessed such a beautiful movie. it is like none other...drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular. the cinematography done by tony scott is extremely well done and unique, unlike another movie. the subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices, and the music is very intriguing for the setting. i got into this movie, and ended up buying it as soon as i could scurry out of the household and head over to best buy. i've watched it several times now. denzel washington (creasy) does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded ex-special forces man with no reason to live. dakota fanning (pita) puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start. they bond and become good friends, until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood, la hermandad. creasy (denzel) tells the mother of dakota fanning that he will hunt down the killers, fearing that pita is dead. this is where creasy really shows the person he can become. he uses his contacts from pita's kidnapping and creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit. my favorite line of all, is in this movie, when christopher walken tells the afi agent that "a man is a work of art, in anything that he does....cooking, whatever. creasy's art is death...he's about to paint his masterpiece." he plays a very unique roll of creasy's old partner and friend. after finally pursuing the brother of "the voice," leader of la hermandad. creasy arranges a meeting to trade pita for himself and the voice's brother. in the end, creasy dies from being shot earlier, and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss. it is a very sincere and sad ending, but a great one. i love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick. the story is in depth, everything is explained from beginning to end, and nothing corny at all in any way or manner.
