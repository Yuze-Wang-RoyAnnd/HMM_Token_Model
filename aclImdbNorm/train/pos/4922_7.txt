i wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on walter jack palance (blackie). certainly he looks like no one else of the time, that skull-like face, flattened nose, and elongated body-- even now he remains an unsettling presence. and what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy new orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague blackie is loosing on the city. i'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes.<br /><br />the movie itself is very skillfully assembled
