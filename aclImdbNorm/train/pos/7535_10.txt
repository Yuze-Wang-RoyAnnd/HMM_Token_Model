the 700 club gives a great perspective on world events. some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy. i find the program to be informative and inspirational. it is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful. there are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and the 700 club is one of them. while mr. robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated, i find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism. i have certainly said some foolish things in my life. i would certainly be willing to forgive mr. robertson since he puts out a great show.
