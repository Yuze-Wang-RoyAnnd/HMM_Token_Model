one of the most appealing elements of a gilliam film is that the well-concocted visuals, the unsettling backdrops, and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator's involvement. instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is some director-for-hire that is paid to feature a star or two), you can feel terry gilliam's presence through the experience. "12 monkeys" is evidence of gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. "12 monkeys" is a variation on similar themes of gilliam's repertoire:oppressive/recessive societies, the solitude of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief, and parallel realms. in this film gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know. this tendency for gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art-house pretentiousness. the difference between gilliam and artsy posers is that gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. the two nearly identical bathing scenes of cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled. his bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease-ridden future world, yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. the title itself is a mark of gilliam's creativity, as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood. all in all, gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience. the film has immense re-watch value, since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing. definitely one of my favorites.
