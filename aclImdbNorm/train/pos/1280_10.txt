i was lucky enough to have seen this on a whim during a film festival and was smacked so hard with what i saw i returned the next night for its second of three screenings. a funny, savage and sharp-toothed attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment passively swallowed without tasting by the lowest-common-denominator target audience waged by a lone-avenger journalist who slowly takes in members for his guerilla-war on predictability is what the movie's all about, and is executed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you're left after the credits roll with hope renewed, and excited that original films can still be made. anyone frustrated with unfulfilled expectations for something to light up their imaginations would do well to hunt (and i do mean hunt) this scarcely-seen item down. for fans of fight club and any charlie kaufman film, and required viewing for anyone who avoids multiplexes like a rabid dog.
