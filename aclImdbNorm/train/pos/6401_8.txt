men of honor has many great aspects to it. good action sequences, plenty of "feel good" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting. mostly by robert deniro. the story of men of honor is focused about carl brashear played by cuba gooding jr. who wants to be the first african american deep sea diver in the navy. it chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further. it is a good story, but it seems like it has been done many times before. a person, against all of the odds, won't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago. it could happen, but a lot of the struggles the brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the c.o. of the diving school tampering with his final test. however, all of that is made up for the scene when robert deniro finally enters the movie. deniro plays mater chief sunday who is the teacher at the diving school brashear is attending. as soon as deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can't hate unless you have incredible wilpower. before the movie ends, deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out. in the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film, but admit it, if it was all the truth, it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes.
