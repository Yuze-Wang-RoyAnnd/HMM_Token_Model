deodato brings us some mildly shocking moments and a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. absolutely a classic in it's own particular kind of way. this movie provides a refreshingly different look at barbarians. if you get a chance to see this movie do so. you'll definitely have a smile on your face most of the time. not because it's funny or anything mundane like that but because it's so bad it goes out the other way and becomes good, though maybe not clean, fun.
