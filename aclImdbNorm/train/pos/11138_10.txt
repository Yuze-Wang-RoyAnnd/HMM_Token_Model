midnight cowboy is not for everybody. it's raw, painful, and realistic but very entertaining. the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances. voight as the texas hustler, joe buck, who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler. he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy. the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women. sadly, buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas. he was raised by his grandmother, sally buck, played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in 1969 from cancer. the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and buck's characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship. the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job. as the film evolves, buck's past comes to the surface and it's haunting but not clear. the film is not for children but compared to today's films and television programming, midnight cowboy might be more tame. i can't forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you can't forget. it's also a tearjerker of a film, so get your hankies out too.
