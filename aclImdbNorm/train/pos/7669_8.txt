doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. it really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. which is why i'd have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of full moon's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em' this could have been a harry potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great - i wasn't sure if ms. nipar hadn't wandered off an a-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. no, seriously! anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license dr. strange, because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom.
