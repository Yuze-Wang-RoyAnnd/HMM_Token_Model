i have to be 100% honest with you fellow imdb users. i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster. doesn't charlotte gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way? i'm in love with that woman! i got what i expected...but only half. this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations.<br /><br />while i don't agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated; i must admit that "pr'ete-moi ta main" has plenty of flaws.<br /><br />my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters. there isn't a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment "of romance" or even a clue to suggest that they're interested in each other.<br /><br />in fact, the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward (when both are in the couch) and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest. i didn't buy the dinner sequence.<br /><br />still, the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise. i mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days.<br /><br />i understand it's a movie and that's why i accept it as a funny situation. plus, the humor is versatile. there are moments involving s&m, funny lines with chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, funny situations involving the family women, and more.<br /><br />charlotte gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she's by far the reason to watch the movie. she's funny, sexy, looks very thin and fine, and demonstrates she's a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance.<br /><br />alain chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance. i think the supporting cast do what they can.<br /><br />the score, art direction, and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film.<br /><br />those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits. it's a good example of feel good cinema.
