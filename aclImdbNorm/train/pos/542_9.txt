when i first found out that brian krause was going to be in this movie, i wanted to watch. it took me weeks to realize that i've seen the original of this and loved it. so i had even more reason to watch. well, i watched. it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies. i hate what happens to brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and i didn't like most of the characters, brian's one included. but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make stanley caldwell (judd nelson) shine once more. at the end, i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending. if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood, i'd suggest you watch this.
