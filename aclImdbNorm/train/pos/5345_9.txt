yesterday my spanish / catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history. spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again. that is why this masterpiece should be shown in all spanish high schools. it is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism. the american pilot who gets involved in the spanish civil war chooses for the democratically elected republican government. the criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that uribe ever made. the colors are magnificent. the cruelty of a war (could anybody tell me the difference between any war and a civil war ?)is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. the cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again. a film like 'el viaje de carol'/ 'carol's journey' tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century. it is a better lesson in history than any book could contain. again great work from the peninsula iberica !
