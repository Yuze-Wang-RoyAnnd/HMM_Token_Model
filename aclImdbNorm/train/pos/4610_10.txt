a winters day, 28th december 1986, two bored 14 year olds hire a movie. "hmmmm, police story, looks interesting", "who is this jackie chan?", "never heard of him". two hours later after watching the film, in a daze, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and severely out of pocket from collecting jc movies!) the film still grabs me like no other. ok, maybe i have a soft spot for it as it was my "first" (cannonball run doesn't count!!) jc movie, but it is an excellent movie. it has all the classic jc elements, action, humour, action, heart and action! some comments say it's dated, it was made in 1985, of course it's dated! but then so must jaws, casablanca, singin' in the rain and the godfather!!!!!! without movies like police story where would hollywood action be today? ps set standards, many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies. to really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen, you miss so much of the movie otherwise (yes, he really does fall off the bus going round the corner!). if you haven't already, see this movie now!!!!<br /><br />
