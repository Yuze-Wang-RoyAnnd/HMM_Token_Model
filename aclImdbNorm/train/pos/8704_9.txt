there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately.<br /><br />a friend, sends me movies now and again, as a surprise, it's awesome.<br /><br />i turned it on and couldn't stop watching, it is a drama, but with a odd twist. imagine if romeo, as in shakepeare, had a super power. it is sad and poetic at the same time. hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema, they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story, without a spectacle. this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist. granted it's not perfect, but nothing ever is. you know what the power is but it is never explained, nor totally realized until the end. it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story. i don't want to see a remake, it is too cool as is, the hollywood system would, as usual, mess it up. acting is top notch all around. directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there. kudos to all involved,and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic. a+++++<br /><br />if you can find i, watch it.
