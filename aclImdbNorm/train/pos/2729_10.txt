i voted excellent for how well the acting was, not for the content. it still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. during the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation. after the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend. the blood-curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills. that the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family. robert blake was excellent in his portrayal of perry smith. the book was also excellently written by truman capote.
