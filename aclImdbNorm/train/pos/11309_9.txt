a masterful treatment of james caine's "the postman always rings twice" as luchino visconti's first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless war-torn italy. the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today. a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai (who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe" (1941), star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband. unusual ending in which, although crime does not pay, one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime. excellent direction, script, acting, and cinematography. reportedly not as good as the french "le dernier tournant' (1939) but probably better than the us version (1946) featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles. highly recommended.
