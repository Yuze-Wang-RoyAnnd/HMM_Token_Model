when i found this film in my local videostore i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of "the lost boys"(1987).to my surprise "to die for" is a really good movie.it's a little bit corny at times,but still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts.this is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times.highly recommended.
