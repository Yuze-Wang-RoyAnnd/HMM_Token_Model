'they all laughed' is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves, and why? their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the appealing star turns from ben gazzara, and the late john ritter who is superb. and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn. the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties, film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak(the films co-producer) and john ritter, basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate's wife(hepburn) and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production, 'they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans.
