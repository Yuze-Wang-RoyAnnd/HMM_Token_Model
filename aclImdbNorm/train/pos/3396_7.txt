very interesting. the big twist wasn't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working. it really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world i live in a lot more. charlton heston does a good job, as do all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic film which was surprising. it lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. the main fault that i could find was that i didn't want the film to end when it did, i would have liked to see what happened next.<br /><br />7/10
