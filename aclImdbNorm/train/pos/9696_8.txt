i'm no fan of newer movies, but this one was a real pleasure to watch. adults and children could watch it together - how unusual! my aunt liked it, too. it had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. it reminded me of a favourite, the wizard of oz. the hero, paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend, marie. highly recommended.
