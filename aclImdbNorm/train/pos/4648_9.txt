hilarious, evocative, confusing, brilliant film. reminds me of bunuel's l'age d'or or jodorowsky's holy mountain-- lots of strange characters mucking about and looking for..... what is it? i laughed almost the whole way through, all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theatre. entertaining through and through, from the beginning to the guts and poisoned entrails all the way to the end, if it was an end. i only wish i could remember every detail. it haunts me sometimes.<br /><br />honestly, though, i have only the most positive recollections of this film. as it doesn't seem to be available to take home and watch, i suppose i'll have to wait a few more years until crispin glover comes my way again with his big slide show (and subsequent "what is it?" screening)... i saw this film in atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash, so i was slightly dazed at the time, which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch the prophetic talking arthropods and the retards in the superhero costumes and godlike glover in his appropriate burly-q setting, scantily clad girlies rising out of the floor like a magnificent dadaist wet dream.<br /><br />is it a statement on life as we know it? of course everyone expects art to be just that. i rather think that the truth is more evident in the absences and in the negative space. what you don't tell us is what we must deduce, but is far more valid than the lies that other people feed us day in and day out. rather one "what is it?" than 5000 movies like "titanic" or "sleepless in seattle" (shudder, gag, groan).<br /><br />thank you, mr. glover (additionally a fun man to watch on screen or at his big slide show-- smart, funny, quirky, and outrageously hot). make more films, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
