it's one of the best movies i've seen in the last 2 years (i've seen the premier in tel-aviv, israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war has began...) this problem in communication between the people, that causes wars, is interesting me for a long time, and it doesn't matter who- boys and girls, straight and gays, jews and arabs... i've seen the bubble already 3 times, and it still surprising and exciting me- each character reminds me of one of the many people i know, and the difference between them, like between tel aviv and jerusalem... the last time i saw it- was with my friend, who is a christian arab, and it was on the independence day of israel ( the most symbolic i could ! how ironic) and... he cried in the end!!! - if he's been touched and wasn't embarrassed- everyone would be touched by the bubble!
