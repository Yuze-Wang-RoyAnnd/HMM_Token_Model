i am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is, i endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it. i had fun watching this movie, perhaps because cat is everything i wish i could be, i am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there's are things that i really found amazing, the way she manipulates people it's just so divine. this is a very underrated movie, i lack of arguments here, i usually go enjoy and then speak little about it, when you go to the movies is to have fun, and i really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room. a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away. let's try not be so critical about it. thank you for reading.
