i was born in 1982. most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late 80's and 90's. i watched the groove tube for the first time in 2001, when i was 19.<br /><br />and i found it hilarious.<br /><br />so for anybody who thinks that something "dated" can't be quite funny 30 years later....think again! it's funny even if you have no idea what the 70's were like, and the thought of bell-bottom pants make you cringe. who can argue with a bozo the clown type who reads adult literature? there is plenty to laugh at. the scrotal puppet show at the end is the best.
