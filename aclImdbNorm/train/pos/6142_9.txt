delightful disney film with angela lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in world war 11 england.<br /><br />lansbury was about age 51 at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part. she is jessica fletcher again but this time it's for the benefit or children and for mother england during a time of great peril.<br /><br />the film follows the adventures of miss price (lansbury) and david tomlinson as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on sorcery. those 3 little darlings sent to live with price to escape the london bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age.<br /><br />too bad that tessie o'shea, roddy mcdowall and sam jaffe are given so little to do in this endearing film.<br /><br />i really thought of the ben stiller film-"night at the museum," at the end of the film when the relics come to life to do battle with the nazi invasion in the small british coastal town.
