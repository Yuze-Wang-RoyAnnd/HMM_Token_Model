i watch cold case because of the real life experiences depicted. this one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully handled, thanks, merideth. all the characters are well developed 3d especially coop. the material is still difficult to approach, the us is far behind the developed nations of the world. only this kind of honest actual experiential portrayal and treatment makes an impact on the population. of course, not everyone sees things the same way but i am heartened that 3/4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 10. you're reaching the hard ones - i will forever reserve the "best episode" place for this episode. please continue taking chances and accept my heartfelt gratitude.
