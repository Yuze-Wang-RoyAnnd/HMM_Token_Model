this is the movie i've seen more times than any other (i believe i saw it on average once every year since it was released). and every time i see it, it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. the cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex yu cinematography. this movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover. in the same league: maratonci trce pocasni krug, balkanski spijun and otac na sluzbenom putu. this is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection.
