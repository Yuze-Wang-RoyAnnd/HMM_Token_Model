yeah, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work.<br /><br />i thought the movie was ok...nothing really outstanding...i just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life.<br /><br />ahh, but that can't happen to rich kids now can it? not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion.<br /><br />no...the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed. after all, who will drive the brand new suv and who will go to law school? <br /><br />ah, the poor little rich kids...in their quaint pretty house, with their ivy league schools, ultra clean homes and socialite parties...what will the world do without them? <br /><br />i hope they all get addicted to drugs, pass-away their life and end up in jail...so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world.
