i'm biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. unfortunately the movie was rather short, unusually so for a period piece, and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect. however, the excellent story makes up for it. the four ladies embark on a much-needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds. over the course of the movie, they realize their problems and begin fixing them. they believe san salvatore, the castle they stay in, has an enchanting effect on people. "it's a tub of love," says lottie wilkins. you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on them.<br /><br />all their problems and their solutions are plausible. the actresses were great. the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale. all in all, a 10/10 movie for me.
