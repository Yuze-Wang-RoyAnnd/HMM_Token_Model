i've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is. life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "a river runs through it" is the perfect name for this film (and norman maclean's novel). life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has it's rough spots, but it is a wonderful trip.<br /><br />robert redford brings a lot to the film. his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly. as a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. as for the acting, craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers. i don't know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyn's performances, except that they truly feel real. "a river runs through it" is a wonderful film.<br /><br />8.6 out of 10
