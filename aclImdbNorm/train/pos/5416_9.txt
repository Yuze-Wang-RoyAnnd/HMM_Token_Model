i only saw it once. this happened in 1952, i was seven, the movie 13.<br /><br />we were so young... but i kept in mind, forever, the strong moments of gunga's sacrifice.<br /><br />i realized that time how much a people can be hardly submitted and used by a foreign nation. under these historical circumstances, in the movie, the personal relation of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, the one raised between people who share daily life, who see each other faces, who knows each other names, but belong to different worlds, can only make appears. then, in the most critical moments a troubling question emerges: "whom are we, in first, supposed to be loyal?", which people, family, motherland, the person you know close to you?. you do not have time to give a perfect answer, urgency is there, and it is for life or death. gunga-din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself. somewhere, in a confuse manner, a problem remains unsolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies, just one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today, because this death, this unique vanishing life i lived it, i shared with my child unconditional friendship. it was lived by the spectator i was. that day i loose gunga-din for ever. as i left behind, later, my pretty childhood, as i left from then so many worlds i lived in. i left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit i didn't expect to do this morning when getting up.
