amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70's, and this, from leading horror scribe robert bloch, is one of their best efforts. there are four stories, all worthwhile, but two -- "sweets for the sweet" and "method for murder" -- distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear.<br /><br />in "sweets", christopher lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter (chloe franks) becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods. franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin stephens in "the innocents". this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage, occurring off-screen, is a moment of purest horror.<br /><br />"method of murder" is about a horror novelist (denholm elliott) who is menaced by one of his own creations, the creepy dominic. this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror. dominic may or may not be real, so director peter duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting.<br /><br />the original poster art, featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding peter cushing's severed head, was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear.
