it was in 1988, when i saw "the ronnie and nancy show" for the first time (on austrian television). at that time, i was already a very big fan of spitting image (since when it won the bronze rose of the montreux film festival in 1986). of course i recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again - especially "the ronnie and nancy show". i remember that scene when ronnie stood in front of a painting of abraham lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said to himself "i need a shave". or most amusing of all, when he played ball with his dog - but vice-versa!<br /><br />it's such a shame, that spitting image seems to fall into oblivion; it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made tv-shows ever. compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all. <br /><br />well, almost 20 years have passed since then, and i wish i could see the show again. is it possible to purchase it from someone... somewhere?
