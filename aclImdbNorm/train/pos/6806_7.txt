ernst marischka, one of the most respected austrian directors of that time, made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life. <br /><br />nowadays, if people should hear about him, they associate the name of marischka with sissi trilogy (1955,1956,1957). however, he made other excellent films like das dreimaderlhaus (1958), embezzled heaven (1958) and definitely this one, madchenjahre einer konigin showing the young years of queen victoria. although it deals with a slightly different theme than sissi films, i do not see many differences between this movie and sissi. they are strikingly similar.<br /><br />the movie is almost identical. the style, the music, the photography. in fact, the crew are almost the same. anton profes, bruno mondi!<br /><br />the cast... romy schneider's one of the first main roles. it was a lovely introduction to her role of sissi since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the austrian empress. it is also a film where romy plays with her mother, magda schneider. but ernst marischka was not the first director who cast romy to play with her mum. romy's debut, wenn der weisse flieder wieder bluhn (1953) was her performance with her mother, too. therefore, there were some voices that romy began her austrian career on the bases of her mother's fame. indeed, there is some truth in it.<br /><br />again, like in sissi, this film shows love very gently. victoria meets prince albert in a little inn in dover. their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles. and now...? what would it be showed like? only sex... but is it the only thing love is based on?<br /><br />i am grateful to ernst marischka for these movies. they had a soul and a message. some people may call them kitschy, but i will never give up admiring these films. they are impressive!!! unfortunately, highly underrated!
