if you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore, tons of jump-scare moments and unrelenting, escalating scenes of excruciating death, then look elsewhere. if you like quiet, moody, thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread, then wendigo is for you.<br /><br />thoughtful, stressed out george, his psychoanalyst wife kim and their young son miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city. on the way up, george hits a stag with his car. the hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that george has ended their chase. in particular, deranged hunter otis takes it personally. he follows the family to their vacation home, making sure they see him. he spies on george and kim as they have sex. he fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren't home, letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return. when kim takes miles to the drugstore in town, miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case, carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag. a native american man tells miles that this is the wendigo, a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry. miles takes the figure home with him, already haunted by the death of the deer the day before. that afternoon, when he and his father go sledding, george is shot and miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed...or is he just in shock, and imagining the whole thing? hours later, george is rushed to the hospital and miles, still clutching his statue, either faints, dreams or goes on a vision quest, in which the wendigo returns. this time the angry, flesh eating god - part tree, part stag and part man - is hunting for otis, who has finally gone over the edge.<br /><br />wendigo is a beautifully made film, almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees. okay, so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking, but it's a small flaw, more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film, and the eerie backdrop of the silent, snowy countryside. the performances are great, particularly by jake weber as the moody and thoughtful george and patricia clarkson as his sweet but no-nonsense wife. they are a happy couple with their share of common problems, and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful. watching this film is often like watching someone's home videos, so realistic are the performances. <br /><br />this movie is not for everyone. a lot of people may find themselves totally bored, waiting for the hideous lovecraftian beast and bloody revenge that never come. we can never really be sure if the wendigo even exists, seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also, later, through the eyes of a madman. this is more a psychological drama than a horror film, but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror.
