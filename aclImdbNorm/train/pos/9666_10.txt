bette midler is again divine! raunchily humorous. in love with burlesque. capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever. all in all singing new ballads, power-singing the good old/perennial ones such as "the rose"; "stay with me" and yes, even "wind beneath my wings". the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it, i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries!
