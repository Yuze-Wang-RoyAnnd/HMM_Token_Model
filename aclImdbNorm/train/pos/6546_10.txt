i'm probably one of the biggest nancy drew fans out there. i've read every book three times over and i've played a lot of the nancy drew games. i loved this movie. it kept you entertained the whole time you watched it. i went with about 10 of my friends and everyone loved it. there were three woman sitting behind us who appeared to be in their late 30's to early 40's and i asked them how they liked it, they said they loved it! so you see it will be an entertainment to all ages. you just have to give it a chance. and it teaches a lesson too, just be yourself even if everyone around you is exactly alike. so overall, this move was great. i'm going to see it a second time now! so stop bashing it please. its a really good movie!
