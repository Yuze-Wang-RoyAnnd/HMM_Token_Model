"telefilms" tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule, which is why this film always tends to buck the trend.<br /><br />george c. scott embodies ebenezer scrooge perfectly, fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies, and still makes him a simpathetic character. the production value for this film was exceptional, never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set-ups, yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops. a movie that certainly stands alone.
