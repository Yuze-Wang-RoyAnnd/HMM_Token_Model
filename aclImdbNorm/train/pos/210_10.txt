two great comedians in a great neil simon movie based on his hit play.<br /><br />great combination, especially when the comedians in question are matthau and burns. small wonder why burns won an oscar for this; he's as sharp and as funny as ever. and matthau is every bit his match, if a tad more crotchety.<br /><br />this is familiar simon territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a tv special but still can't stand one another after all these years.<br /><br />it's a delight to watch these two pick at each other, their scenes together make this film an absolute delight. myself, i especially enjoyed the "knock, knock, knock / enter!" scene. and if you're a fan of either burns or matthau, you'll enjoy it, too.<br /><br />in fact, you'll enjoy the whole movie. <br /><br />ten stars. put a little "sunshine" in your life.
