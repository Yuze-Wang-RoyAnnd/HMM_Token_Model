john thaw, of inspector morse fame, plays old tom oakley in this movie. tom lives in a tiny english village during 1939 and the start of the second world war. a bit of a recluse, tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son while he was serving during the first world war. if you can imagine inspector morse old and retired, twice as crochety as when he was a policeman, then you've got tom oakley's character.<br /><br />yet this heart of flint is about to melt. london children are evacuated in advance of the blitz. young william (willie) beech is billeted with the protesting tom. willie is played to good effect by nick robinson.<br /><br />this boy is in need of care with a capital c. behind in school, still wetting the bed, and unable to read are the smallest of his problems. he comes from a horrific background in london, with a mother who cannot cope, to put it mildly.<br /><br />slowly, yet steadily, man and boy warm to each other. tom discovers again his ability to love and care. and the boy learns to accept this love and caring. see tom and willie building a bomb shelter at the end of their garden. see willie's joy at what is probably his first ever birthday party thrown by tom.<br /><br />not to give away the ending, but willie is adopted by tom after much struggle, and the pair begin a new life much richer for their mutual love.<br /><br />in this movie, thaw and robinson are following in a long line of movies where man meets boy and develop a mutual love. see the late dirk bogarde and jon whiteley in "spanish gardener". or clark gable and carlo angeletti in "it started in naples". or robert ulrich and kenny vadas in "captains courageous". or mel gibson and nick stahl in "man without a face".<br /><br />two points of interest. this is the only appearance of thaw that i know of where he sings. only a verse of a hymn, new jerusalem, but he does sing.<br /><br />second, young robinson also starred in a second movie featuring "tom" in the title, "tom's midnight garden", which is based on a classic children's novel.
