sidney stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories. stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or wears out. when stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), so stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in england. the film is ideal and only ealing could have made it so. guiness' performance (and a great supporting cast such as greenwood, thesiger, and parker) and mackendrick's direction make the film a delight, but the real hero is the story itself, a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance, and suspense. rating, 8.
