this movie was the best movie i have ever seen. being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith. although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart. this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with. after i saw this movie,there was not a single dry eye in the entire room. everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it. i highly recommend this movie for everyone.
