i am a big fan of stephen king's work, and this film has made me an even greater fan of king. pet sematary is about the creed family. they have just moved into a new house, and they seem happy. but there is a pet cemetery behind their house. the creed's new neighbor jud (played by fred gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. that burial ground is pure evil. jud tells louis creed that when you bury a human being (or any kind of pet) up in the burial ground, they would come back to life. the only problem, is that when they come back, they are not the same person, they're evil. soon after jud explains everything about the pet sematary, everything starts to go to hell. i wont explain anymore because i don't want to give away some of the main parts in the film. the acting that pet sematary had was pretty good, but needed a little bit of work. the story was one of the main parts of this movie, mainly because it was so original and gripping. this film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie, and frightening. one of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back, was in fact the make-up effects. there is one character in this film that is truly freaky. that character is "zelda." this particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise. zelda is rachel creed's sister who passed away years before, but rachel is still haunted by her. the first time zelda appears in the movie isn't generally scary because she isn't talking or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares the living **** out of me. there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect. pet sematary delivers great scares, some pretty good acting, first rate plot, and mesmerizing make-up. this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time. 10 out of 10.
