an end of an era was released here in the states in spring 2002 with "the rookie," a disney live action film that seemed to be the "best for last!!!!!" it took place right here in texas! actually, the story began in west texas, as evidenced by an area code found on a sign over there. it was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional!!!!!<br /><br />what i liked about this movie: it was sooo nice!!!!! it was a very good sports movie, ala "the mighty ducks" trilogy. it had also taken moviegoers across texas, from somewhere between the panhandle and el paso all the way to the metroplex (where i live). i can tell because i recognize that ballpark (was "the ballpark in arlington;" now it's "ameriquest field")! it was nice to see disney's "golden age" end here in my area!!!!!<br /><br />r.i.p.<br /><br />golden age of disney<br /><br />1920s-spring 2002<br /><br />"it all started with a mouse...and it ended with baseball."
