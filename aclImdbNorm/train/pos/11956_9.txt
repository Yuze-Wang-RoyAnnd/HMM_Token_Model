i'd even say some shades of hitchcock...this is clearly better than mmm, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most woody fans. by the way, did you know that annie hall was first conceived as a murder mystery? anyhow, woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one. the plot turns are nice and tight. i will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some of the actors are a little too hasty at delivering their lines, but stick around. scarlett johansson proves well-cast in the diane keaton-type role, and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older woody. no one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of peter lyman than jackman.
