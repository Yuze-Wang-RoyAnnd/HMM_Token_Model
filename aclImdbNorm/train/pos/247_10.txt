i loves this movie,because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved! heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe. it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that. the language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there. this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers! i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one. there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at! also that that is how people remember them,from their armor. i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have.
