yesterday i attended the world premiere of "descent" at the tribeca film festival in nyc. i had a great time. it was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow my-spacer marcus patrick.<br /><br />i give the movie 7.5 starts out of a possible 10 stars.<br /><br />the movie begins with maya (rosario dawson) at college. you can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on. the photography in this film was excellent. she meets jared (chad faust) and they become sweethearts. it appears like any other relationship in the beginning. the man is in quest of the woman's attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get. both played this well. very innocent flirtation between the two. he invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart.<br /><br />the apartment is very dreary and dark. they eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles. this actually reminded me of a dungeon. here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her. this is a very dark and gritty rape scene. this scene is not for the young or weak at heart. the rape scene is a little long and hard to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows.<br /><br />maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex. she falls into her own abyss. she starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there. she is told to go see adrian (marcus patrick). the first thing i remember about this character is that they say "he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving". he is actually the one who introduces maya to drugs. they begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie. the club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise. i thought they were well done and i noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience.<br /><br />maya is then back in college as a ta and who is in her class -- jared her rapist!! you could see the confusion and emotion on maya's face. what should i do?? what do i do next?? the shots of her face and the emotions are priceless.<br /><br />what unfolds next is not actually whats happening. she acts interested in jared. she appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again. i was sitting there saying could this really be happening. it wasn't. nothing could be farther from the truth.<br /><br />she invites him to her apartment and of course, he shows up. now her apartment is dark and gritty. she has him strip down completely. he thinks he's going to get "lucky". she then teases him like any woman can. she's caressing him everywhere and he's getting excited. note:: for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity - may not be right for the younger viewer.<br /><br />she then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him. once again, the scene is dark, gritty, and very rough.<br /><br />if you are going to see the movie and don't want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph.<br /><br />this is where adrian reenters the picture. maya has adrian save(?) her by performing extremely rough male sex with jared. she thinks this is the final revenge. adrian continues to take all of jared's manhood and strips his dignity to nothing. marcus, as adrian, plays this scene as believable as anyone can. he is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen. after the movie, during a q&a session, marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and chad. maya believes that this revenge will save her but i don't think it does. one of the final scenes has a closeup of mays's face and you see a tear roll down her cheek. this was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie. did she get the revenge she wanted?? was it as satisfying as she expected?? in my opinion, it does not. it only makes matters worse.<br /><br />this is an excellent movie, will well acted roles, and i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it. i would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age. rosario, chad, and marcus should be commended for jobs well done. the directing and photography must also be commended. it was a night that i enjoyed.
