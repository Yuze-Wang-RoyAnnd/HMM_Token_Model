offbeat and rather entertaining sleeper concerning two very different brothers who are both not only so-called "fire starters" (think stephen king's snore-fest of a book with the same name), but also forever at odds with each other over a woman who has a rather nasty habit of being a pyromaniac! good special effects (especially towards the end), quirky performances from a pretty talented trio of actors and topped by a really interesting and oddly appropriate soundtrack ultimately make "wilder napalm" a unique treat of a film to watch...if you can find it that is! on a personal note, i was fortunate enough to snatch it up (so to speak) from the two-dollar bin at my local video-rental store. (*** out of *****)
