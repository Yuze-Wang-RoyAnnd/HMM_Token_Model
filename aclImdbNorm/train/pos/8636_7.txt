so-so thriller starring brad pitt and juliette lewis, who join david duchovny and michelle forbes on a road trip out west. the latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; pitt's a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to dave) and juliette is his poor, not-all-there companion. this is a good cast and the story moves along, but pitt isn't belivably scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his better earlier roles. the best thing is here is michelle forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles on `homicide: life on the street' or in the brief series `wonderland.'<br /><br />vote: 6
