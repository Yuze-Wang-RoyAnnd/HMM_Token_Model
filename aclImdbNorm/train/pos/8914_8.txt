i grew up in royersford, pa. the town where jerry's market was. i remember my whole family going out to watch the filming. i remember a guy showing the "blob" to me and my brothers in a bucket. i also would like to share that my mother was in the movie. her hair style was the same as aneta corsaut's and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with steve mcqueen for some shots from behind. they payed her $25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past august. my mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister.
