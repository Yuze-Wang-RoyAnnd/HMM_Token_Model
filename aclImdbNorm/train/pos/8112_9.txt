geniuses william cameron menzies and herbert george wells craft this extraordinary anticipation film, with ambition and scope hard to find today. they predict world war ii and the way great britain was attacked, and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. they change the timing; in the film the war and the space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it's amazing. we even see an helicopter (the film is older than them).<br /><br />unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists that seem romans with bubble-helmets: if you can see through those funny costumes you may appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters from the 30s, well's vision of a rationalistic society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and john cabal as archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being, the one that chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it.<br /><br />9 1/2 out of 10. inspiring like that final monologue by john cabal.
