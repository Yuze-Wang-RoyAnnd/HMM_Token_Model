part of what was so great about the classic looney tunes cartoons was their irreverence and how they weren't afraid to do anything that they wanted. in this case, marvin the martian has an assignment to bring back an earthling. sure enough, he comes across bugs bunny, who warns of a mutiny on the part of marvin's dog. after marvin finally traps bugs - by means of an acme strait jacket-ejecting bazooka! - bugs has more stuff planned for the voyage back to mars. what i mean is, if you thought that it was a major change in the solar system when they stripped pluto of its planet status, then you ain't seen nothing yet! yes, "the hasty hare" goes all out. how they buy acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people, but the point here - i mean "hare" - is to have fun. and believe me, you definitely will. after all, a little space-out never hurt anyone.
