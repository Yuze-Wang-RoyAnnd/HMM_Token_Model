interesting how much more realistic brosnan's performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films. he's neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot. this is perfect break for him, even so much as to make fun of the bond icon. "i'm a mess, a parody of myself" he says. it doesn't get any better than that. i just finished reading dr.no and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond. personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely. there was nothing for him to personalize the character with, as compared to roger moore or sean connery. its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall. a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with. it's an impressive portrayal, and having greg kinear to ground him, is just poetic. this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in "my blue heaven", but more genuine in their coping mechanisms.
