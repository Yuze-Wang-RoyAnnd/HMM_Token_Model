i loved this episode. it is so great that all 5 of them team up and stop luthercorp and save the world. i also love this episode because kyle gallner (bart allen/impulse) and justin hartley (oliver queen/green arrow) are guest starring in it!!! i just hope that clark will join the justice league and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!! =)it was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next. i think chloe should also join the team as watchtower, that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the daily planet because she doesn't have super powers. also, i want to find out what types of subjects lex is going to use for 33.1, i wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have!!!
