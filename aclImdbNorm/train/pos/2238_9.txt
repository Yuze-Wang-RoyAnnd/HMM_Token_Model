as this movie is completely in swiss dialect, it's probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie. i'm not from switzerland, but i worked there for some years, so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings. i've seen a lot of movies of this kind (eg. scary movie, loads of scifi spoofs etc.) but this one is the best one of that kind, i've seen so far. i give a 9 of 10. the only reason i can't give a 10 is, because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd, so there's almost no chance for non-swiss to understand.
