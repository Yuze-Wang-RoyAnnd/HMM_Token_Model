went to wal-mart and found this film on dvd and had no idea whether i made a bad purchase or a good one. it is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end. michelle rodriquez,(diana guzman),"bloodrayne",'05, gave a great performance and her looks are beautiful, sexy, and at the same time a real study in the art of how acting is really performed. diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother. she decides to get boxing training in a local brooklyn gym and is not really well accepted by the male boxers. in her high school there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys. there is lots of action in the ladies bathroom and references as to private parts of guys. if you like boxing, and seeing a hot sexy gal do wonders in the ring and knock the boys on their you know what, this is the film for you.
