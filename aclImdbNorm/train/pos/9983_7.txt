this movie is about basically human relations, and the interaction between them. the main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past, doing an analysis of how she lived her life. this journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home. it is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy, real love, marriage or destiny. although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new, this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. there is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable, but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed. i really recommend this movie for a quiet saturday afternoon.
