this was actually my favorite series of scooby doo when i was younger. i thought each episode had more of an edge to it and the villains had a lot of creative thought put into them (and even very scary and believable as well). some of the best episodes were "i left my neck in san francisco", "twenty thousand screams under the sea", "the ghoul, the bat and the ugly" and "when you wish upon a star creature". if you have never seen these episodes please do. this series was a bit of a mixed bag though as there were other episodes which didn't seem to have the same kind of edge to them such as "rocky mountain yiiii!" and "the ransom of scooby chief". as like the series before it, it was very well put together, interesting storyline and brilliantly drawn. as everyone says though, it would have been so much better without scrappy doo. the character was tiresome and distracting to the story that was being told.
