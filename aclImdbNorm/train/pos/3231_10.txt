soldier isn't a great movie, and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons. but i liked soldier alot, partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me.<br /><br />first, the art direction is tight and well executed. as far as science fiction backdrops go, soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre. the sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; i didn't love all of their future military style, but i was impressed with the effort. for me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.<br /><br />second, i'm a kurt russell fan. i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films. soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero. it's not an award winning role, but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialog.<br /><br />third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. this isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.<br /><br />if you haven't seen it, and you like sci-fi action films, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice. just don't expect the next bladerunner.
