i could never remember the name of this show. i use to watch it when i was 8. i remember staying up late when i wasn't suppose to just so i could watch this show. it was the best show to me. from what i remember of it, it is still great. this showed starred lucas black making him the first boy i ever had a crush on. i am from the country, therefore boys with an accent have no appeal to me, but for him i would definitely make an exception. which after seeing crazy in alabama, friday night lights, and tokyo drift you should see why. he is a great actor and has been since he was a kid. i miss this show and wish it would come back out. if anyone ever sees where they are selling the season please email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
