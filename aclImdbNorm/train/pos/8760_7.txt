it's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other american movie, and then be surprised when that doesn't happen. i like a happy ending as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic manner, and i thought brokedown palace did this very well.<br /><br />the ending, with one friend basically sacrificing herself for the other, thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place, was very moving. i almost rather would have done without the last line, which proved that she didn't actually do the deed she confessed to, because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls, and less about the crime. whether she did it or not wasn't that important.<br /><br />the story itself bordered on the clich'e, but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances. very realistic, very captivating.<br /><br />7 out of 10.
