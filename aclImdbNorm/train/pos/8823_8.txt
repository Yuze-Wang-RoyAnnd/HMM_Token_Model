good film. tells a boyish fantasy story, telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently. or at least the feeling: that you have to break every rule if you are to break one. if you wanted to express love for someone you don't know, how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation? also it's about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life, of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats. what gives disney or fox or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice. are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self. do we have to listen to the nrj shouting, see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee?
