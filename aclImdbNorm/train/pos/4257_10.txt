this movie about two italian brothers who came to germany with their family is just great!<br /><br />it isn't an idealistic movie, i would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place. the characters are very nice but have also some "dark" sides, what makes you believe that these are real persons. great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time, but that you can find happiness with "fire and passion" as the main character gigi would say.
