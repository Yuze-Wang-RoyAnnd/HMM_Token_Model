i probably doubled my knowledge of iran when i saw secret ballot (2001). now i know about four times as much (i doubt i learned a whole heck of a lot from not without my daughter (1991)).<br /><br />offside is a splendid budget iranian comedy about a group a girls (working individually) to attend a decisive soccer match for their country's place in the world cup. women are not allowed to attend soccer matches, so the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to enter from themselves. some (teen?) girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys, but are caught. the movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are detained by soldiers, awaiting some unspecified punishment (although, the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executed!)<br /><br />the movie explores the absurdity of the situation. the thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sex
