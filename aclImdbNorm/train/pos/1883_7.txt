excellent comedy starred by dudley moore supported by liza minnelli and good-speaking john gielgud. moore is arthur, a man belonging to a multimillionaire family, who was near to get 750 million dollars provided that he marries to a lady (susan) from another multimillionaire family. in principle, arthur accepted the conditions, but he finally refused when he met nice and poor linda marolla (liza minneli). arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes. after several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, arthur decided not to marry susan only few minutes before their wedding. the end was happy for linda and arthur although the latter knew that his life will change in the coming future. this comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone. rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life.
