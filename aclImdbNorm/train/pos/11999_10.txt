i have seen this wonderful production, and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife-i am not sure of her character's name. i went to byu with her and lost touch with her-her maiden name was kim luke-and i wonder if anyone has any info on her. she is not listed in the credits. this production was outstanding, a tear-jerker on all accounts, superb acting by all. i guess i don't even want to put it in the general category of 'acting', more like 'portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final dispensation'.....something like that. if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know!!! she was fantastic in her role, by the way....thanks, melissa thorne
