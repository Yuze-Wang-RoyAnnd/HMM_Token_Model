for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the soviet view of modern russian history this monumental film is a treasure. the story starts at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times (i.e. the 1960s).<br /><br />the story focuses on a boy in a remote siberian village, who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. he later joins the bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village. his son, by the local beauty, fights the germans during the second world war. when he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some soviet economic idealism.<br /><br />this film is long and slow, but utterly logic and very well made. it can be seen in three parts.
