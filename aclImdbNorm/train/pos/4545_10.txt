i saw this movie recently. 2 hours later, my head still hurt from laughing. the plot was soo awful, the jokes were soo bad, but what i didn't count on were:<br /><br />1. the 2 scenes before and after the movie that had pat and jay posing (that caused more than enough laughter)<br /><br />2. the kick through the windshield that decapitated the evil-doer.<br /><br />this movie is about 20 times better than the rush hour series, and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you didn't like the movie, send certificate to hbo. while i considered it, the date you had to send it in was january 1991 (which also caused wackiness to ensue).
