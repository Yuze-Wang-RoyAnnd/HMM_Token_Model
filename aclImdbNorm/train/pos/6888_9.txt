i watch movies for a living, picking out which ones are good enough to distribute... tossing aside those that don't make the cut. i'm not saying that i know more than anyone else based on this, i'm just leading you to how i came to watch "the gospel of lou"... anyways... so many bad movies land on my desk and i actually sit through all of them. i don't actually "watch" everything, usually i just look over at the tv occasionally while i'm working the scan for production value, performance, and how well the story is being presented. if something catches my eye i'll take the time to watch it. "lou" drew me in during the first few minutes where i closed my laptop and wheeled my chair over to the tv so i could completely tune in. needless to say i was enthralled throughout the whole movie. the story is told well, the characters are either endearing or repulsive (depending of course on the actor and directors intention for the character) and all very well played. at times i caught occasional amateur mistakes in the camera work and editing, but the emotional nature of the story make these faults easy to dismiss. i've heard other people's comments say that at times the film brought tears to their eyes, other time extreme elation... i was laughing one minute and crying the next and was incredibly touched by this movie. sadly i was unable to acquire it because i was - as the saying goes - a week late and a dollar short. that's the way it goes sometimes... but at least i had the pleasure of seeing this one and i can't wait to see what kind of response it gets. good luck and great fortune to you bret carr (if you read this), you are without a doubt a talent to watch for.
