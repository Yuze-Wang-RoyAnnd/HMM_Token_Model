okay. yes, this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity errors (like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together), and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt-out part, and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles). but come on. richard grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). steven ford was very likable. mancuso had some great lines, while nancy allen, ironically, was completely bland and uninteresting. classic? no. bad parts? yes. entertaining? big yes. i would have loved to have been on-set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have. "are you fast?" ... "y'ain't that fast."
