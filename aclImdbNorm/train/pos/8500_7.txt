surprised to see the rather low score for this movie. just saw this film for the first time in 10 years, and was reminded why i like it.<br /><br />come back with me, children, to a time when michael keaton was a straight-up comedy guy, and you might find some joy in this film. it's a gentle comedy -- the kind ron howard specializes in -- but if that's your thing, you should check this out. keaton's low-key charm is just right for this project.<br /><br />"gung ho" is a bit dated, because it takes places in the last stage of the pre-global economy world, when it still mattered what country a business was based in. that said, it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other, to great benefit.<br /><br />you could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked, but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs. it's like an i.v. drip. and i mean that in a good way.
