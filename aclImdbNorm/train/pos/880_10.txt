probably the best film of the year for me. this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla (emmanuelle devos) who spends her days doing other men's jobs, uncredited, and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as, being partially deaf, she reads lips. a change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con paul (vincent cassel) as her assistant. the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film. mutual dependency, for vastly different reasons, bonds them. carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for,what seems like,the first time. paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help. he owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve carlas' skill of reading lips. i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense/drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. throughout the whole film, no matter what other characters are on screen, you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul. i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. emmanuell devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the french cesar for best actress). you never feel like you are watching a piece of acting, this really is carla. the chameleon like vincent cassel is also wonderful. he makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive. i loved this film because of these two people, and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again.
