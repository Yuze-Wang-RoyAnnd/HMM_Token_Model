perhaps the best isabel allende's book, house of the spirits describes an alternative chilean history, this one full of magic, a mystic veil, plus some kind of omnipresent sadness. this movie gathers a great cast, plus a great art direction, with a script that cannot contain all this book's quality. it's unusual for a nearly unknown country like chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie, whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high, and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset, mostly because they understood very little.
