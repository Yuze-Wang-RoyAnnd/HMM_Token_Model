with harry callahan getting up in years, the inevitable `old man with a chip on his shoulder' story had to come into play eventually. callahan, looking fragile sometimes and out of place, his demeanor still was unwavering. thankfully, this film took some time off to develop a different type of story, one that might reinvent the dirty harry and the whole genre. while the film fell short in doing so, it was still an excellent addition to the series, even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and new wave music.
