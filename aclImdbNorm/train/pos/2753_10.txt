my all-time favorite movie! i have seen many movies, but this one beats them all! excelent acting, wonderful story. you will, as a "normal" caring person start to love george. altough he is an actor, he is also himself and a very lovable person. and maby most important thing: you will learn to respect & look different to people with down syndrome.
