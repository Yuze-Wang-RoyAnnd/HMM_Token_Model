i hadn't heard about brashear before i watched this. this is the story of him and the man who trained him, helping him to become the first african-american us navy diver. a tale of will-power. the plot is well-written, and develops nicely throughout. this is what it seems, the typical underdog thing, and it doesn't hold too many surprises. it's also quite hollywood, but hey, i don't know the actual man, maybe it's close to how it actually happened. nevertheless, it gets the job done, with dramatic scenes and adversity along the way, and this is inspirational for anyone who's ever heard the words "no, you can't" be spoken about their life-long dream. the acting performances are all excellent. deniro and gooding jr. both shine whenever they're on-screen. rapaport is marvelous, as well. the characters are well-written, credible and consistent. this is well-edited, and features good cinematography. the production values are high, and this does a fairly convincing job of transporting us back to the 50's. this is the only film i've seen by this director and the writer, though i may now consider looking into more they're responsible for. there is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise no offensive material. i recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting, and/or fans of those who made it. 7/10
