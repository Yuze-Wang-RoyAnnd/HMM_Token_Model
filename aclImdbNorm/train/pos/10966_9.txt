grey gardens is a world unto itself. edith and little edie live in near total isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their (apparently) shared bedroom. cats loll about while mother edith insults her daughter's elocution. this is a tennessee williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights, as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real.<br /><br />the situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50-ish daughter lived for a decade (other than that they were poor and clean). they would bicker all day, grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men, work, and self-expression.<br /><br />this film is a must-see for anyone writing a mother/daughter relationship of this kind. it is sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly. it is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context--remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion.
