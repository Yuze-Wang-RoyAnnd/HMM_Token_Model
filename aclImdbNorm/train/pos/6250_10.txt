there is something special about the austrian movies not only by seidl, but by spielmann and other directors as well. this is the piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie. hundstage is no exception. this effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing. in hundstage i have never had the feeling that these are actors playing, but real people instead. so real is the visceral feeling of the viewer...almost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block.<br /><br />any person living in vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their meckern/sudern (complaining), their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys. this is further reinforced by the viennese dialect which is, according to many, especially made for complaining as a way of life. a special parochialism and arrogance typical for vienna are also very well portrayed.<br /><br />the viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the movie with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens. moreover, they have been turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores. inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasure-giving activities, trying to stay in touch with their human selves, yet in vain. the examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which bordered on rape, the prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers.<br /><br />the film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the normality/abnormality of its images only. another typical feature of seidl (and other austrian directors) is his showing of disturbingly sexual images. these include the stripping of the old woman for her husband, the sexual scenes in the bath, the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment, etc.<br /><br />in hundstage seild has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much viennese as they could be citizens of paris, new york or madrid. the viewers should not despise or feel pity for the viennese in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation, albeit in different circumstances. in the end, i believe seidl's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in hundstage. and if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation, seidl has achieved his goal.
