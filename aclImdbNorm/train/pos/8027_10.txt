when i saw it for the first time i was really impressed.the director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. through all the story spectators can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it first.but..the main point was not conflict but..friendship!older and mature one prayed himself to save the younger who has the whole life to life.it is amazing. every time i watch it i enjoy!of course it is pretty violent like every action movie but i think it is acceptable. thanks a lot louis liosa and tom berenger! amazing film!i advice everyone to see it.i am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time.
