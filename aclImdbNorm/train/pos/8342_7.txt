fairly good romantic comedy in which i don't think i've ever seen meg looking any cuter. all the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp. of course, in the real world no genius mathematician would even glance at some grease monkey, but that is why i love romantic comedies....one can just totally forget reality and have a good time. nice film. damn, meg is a babe, eh?
