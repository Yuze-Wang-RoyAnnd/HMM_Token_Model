slow but beautifully-mounted story of the american revolution. griffith's story-telling seems a lot less heavy-handed than in his earlier historical epics and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action. lionel barrymore is an utter swine, neil hamilton is poor but dashing and carol dempster is.... well, carol dempster is most of what is wrong with griffith in this period, but she doesn't show up often enough to slow the pace and drama.<br /><br />note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than 2 hours when first released, but that no cut exists that runs longer than 90 minutes. however, the dvd release has been presented at a slower fps rate that increases the tension and brings it back to a bit over two hours.<br /><br />far better in terms of story-telling than sound versions, such as the patriot. while not quite in the league of griffith's best, such as way down east and broken blossoms, an excellent way to spend a couple of hours.
