"father of the pride " was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life . and that is pretty sad ,specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air ( think in "the simple life ") i admit that are many similarities with this show and "the simpsons" ,but despite the similarities ,the show have it own merits . the animation is just adequate ,not incredible ,but is good .the best are the characters . all the animals are very likable and funny , and even sigfried and roy had their moments . the music was good ,i liked many of the songs .<br /><br />even if the show isn't very original ,i think that this had lots of potential .like "mission hill " a show that isn't very famous but i liked a lot , this didn't have the appreciation that it deserved . what a shame .
