moe and larry are newly henpecked husbands, having married shemp's demanding sisters. at his music studio, shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! <br /><br />"husbands beware" is a remake of 1947's "brideless groom," widely considered by many to be one of the best stooge films with shemp. the remake contains most of the footage from that film. the new scenes, shot may 17, 1955, include the storyline of moe and larry marrying shemp's sisters, along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine! a few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well(a double for dee green was used; if you blink, you will miss the double's appearance.) <br /><br />"husbands beware" would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters. budget considerations, coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies, influenced the decision to use older footage.<br /><br />although completely new films were still being made by the stooges, most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in. "husbands beware," while one of these hybrids, is watchable and entertaining; we get to see most of "brideless groom" again, and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film. this film is one of the last stooge comedies to feature new footage of shemp, and it was released six weeks after his death.<br /><br />7 out of 10.
