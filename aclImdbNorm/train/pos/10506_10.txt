rated e <br /><br />i never actually owned a nintendo 64 but i have played one many times.in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day, super mario 64 is one of the best video games for the nintendo 64 system.i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time.if you have an n64 and don't have this game you should try to find it.the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario 64 has a 3d mario in a nice 3d environment.the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game.you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the 120 power stars from bowzer.now you can do it in a 3d environment.super mario 64 is a very fun and good n64 game and i recommend it.<br /><br />10/10
