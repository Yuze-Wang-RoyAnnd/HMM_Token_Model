this zippy and fun short from 1916 - the time when charlie chaplin and fatty arbuckle were the big names in comedy - features the young oliver hardy as a ne'er-do-well who has to quickly impress his wealthy uncle by producing a wife and baby for his visit.<br /><br />of course this does not go smoothly and soon there are rather more wives and babies than he can cope with; plus the mandatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of early movie slapstick.<br /><br />restored well it can be viewed as part of 'the early films of oliver hardy' and is now available on dvd, a fine addition to the available corpus of the big screen favourite comedy duo.
