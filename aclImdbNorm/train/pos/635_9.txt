i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.<br /><br />the plot line really is nothing like i have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters. in spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. the flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. the soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv. and even though i might have known what was coming at points, i still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.<br /><br />my one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is i can't figure out why.
