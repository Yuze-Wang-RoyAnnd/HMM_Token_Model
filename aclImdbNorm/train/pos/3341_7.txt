i saw this movie on thursdays night after having a really boring day. i had no expectations, those i had were rather negative. being that the only movie i've ever watched jimmy in is the american version of taxi with queen latifah(?)...don't ask why! but seriously..this movie is so cute! drew barrymore is always sweet, but i almost fell in love with fallon's character. why can't i meet a cute nerd like that. :) movies like that are excellent. simple, sweet and necessary. sunday on a thursdays. i'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about american movies with baseball that fascinates me. probably the fact that we don't have that sport here in norway.<br /><br />(my first comment ever.) haha
