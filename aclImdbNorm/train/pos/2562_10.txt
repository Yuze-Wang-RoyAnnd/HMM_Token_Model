this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen. yes, i can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract from the film. one should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time. clearly by the "sex in the city" standards, charlie chaplin was horribly boring. however, when judged from the prospective of 1925 america, he was fantastic. likewise sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed-race love affair, american "manifest destiny" arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures. it is a natural next step to such films as gentleman's agreement. its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, rather, it is entertaining and enjoyable, with innumerable lines that one just doesn't forget.<br /><br />however, even when taken only as a love story, it is terrific. although, some attack brando's accent, he is at his near best in nuance and characterization. buttons and umeki (who both won oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film.<br /><br />taka, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema. the dialog between taka and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the film's end is equally good. of course, it doesn't have the mouth-sucking, spit-swapping and worse, that exemplifies love in today's movies, but that makes it all the better. it portrays true love and passion, and not just "heat." if this movie doesn't touch you, then you are just too young, too cynical or dead.
