i thought this movie was pretty good. some parts were corny but that's understandable since it was made more than 55 years ago. i thought the best performance in the movie was given by michele morgan who played millie convincingly. jack haley is also really good as mike o'brien. even though i'm not a big frank sinatra fan, i think he was very good in this movie. if your have a craving for a silly, over the top musical comedy, higher and higher is the movie for you.<br /><br />
