... this isn't the first time stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. in dr. strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing ("five months of peace is just what i want... ") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.<br /><br />i disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on jack torrance in the filmed version. the cues nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. the environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. in much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. he may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.<br /><br />kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is jack nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. when he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. if you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that well and truly shines...
