this is the only david zucker movie that does not spoof anything the first of its kind. the funniest movie of 98 with night at the roxbury right behind but i did not think theres something about mary was funny so that doesnt count except for the frank and beans thing he he. dont listen to the critics especially roger ebert he does not know solid entertainment just look at his reviews.anyway see it you wont be dissapionted
