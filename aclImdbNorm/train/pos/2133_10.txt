i have lost count of just how many times i have seen this movie - i probably know the entire dialog backwards - yet i am drawn to it time and again.<br /><br />set in hungary, a young jimmy stewart plays the eligible bachelor "kralik" who becomes the secret admirer of margaret sullavan's innocent "klara". kralik secretly becomes klara's pen-friend, and at work together klara confides in kralik about the content of his (kralik's) letters. clearly kralik is besotted with klara - but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the "pen-friend". confused? well you wont be - this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending - but we all know it is the ending we all want.<br /><br />other characters worth mentioning are frank morgan playing his usual role, this time as the shop's owner "hugo matuschek", felix bressart as "pirovitch", kralik's confidant. joseph schildkraut as the womanising arrogant "vadas" - so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning.<br /><br />finally william tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over-confident upstart of a shop junior "pepi katona".<br /><br />recently re-made as "you've got mail" starring tom hanks & meg ryan for me is not as good as the original - although i suspect younger audiences would disagree.<br /><br />if this film is on in your area over christmas, i suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of kleenex handy.
