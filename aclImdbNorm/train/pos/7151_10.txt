i read holes in 5th grade so when i heard they were doing a movie i was ecstatic! of course, being my busy self, i didn't get chance to see the movie in theaters. holes was at the drive-in just out of town but, alas, we were just too busy. i was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me! they all said it was good but i've read great books that have made crappy movies so i was definately worried.<br /><br />suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came. it was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and i was left to babysit. my sister, who is 9, and i watched it and absolutely loved it! i then took it to the other people i was babysitting's house and their kids, 9 and 4, liked it too. even my parents loved it and they're deffinately movie critics. overall, i recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morale and and loves a hilarious cast! this movie should be on your top 5 "to see" list!!!!
