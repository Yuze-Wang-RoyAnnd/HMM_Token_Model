i wasn't alive in the 60's, so i can't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period, but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience. there are some excellent performances, most notably by josh hamilton (of with honors), jerry o'connell (sliders), who play brothers divided by the war. bill smitrovich, a character actor who has been long ignored by many, gives a heart-filled performance as their strict father, who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to vietnam but returns empty inside, while the other is exactly the opposite. all in all, this is a powerful and heartwarming film that i hope everyone gets a chance to experience.
