despite the patronage of george lucas, this captivating and totally original fantasy in "lumage" (a combination of animation through live action cut-outs) is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by ralph bakshi in his heyday. brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape-shifting dog ralph (one of a duo of bumbling, rejected heroes), synonamess botch (the hilariously foul-mouthed villain) and rod rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) breathe life into a uniquely clever concept: frivoli vs. murkwood or, the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares. in this context, the mor-infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do. it's a real pity, therefore, that i have had to watch this via a truly crappy-looking boot (culled from a tv screening) of the uncensored version
