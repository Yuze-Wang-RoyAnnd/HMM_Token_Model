i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king's books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable.<br /><br />i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary.<br /><br />the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out. and the "no fair" uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance.<br /><br />
