usually, when we use the word "escapist", we mean it negatively; warren beatty's big screen version of "dick tracy" proves that "escapist" can be good. this is truly one entertaining movie. as the eponymous, yellow-clad, fearless title character, beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses.<br /><br />from there, the rest of characters are almost a world unto themselves. tess truehart (glenne headly) is as glamorous as one would expect the hubby of any crime fighter to be; breathless mahoney (madonna) is possibly the most perplexing person imaginable; big boy caprice (al pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but cool. other characters include the speech-challenged mumbles (dustin hoffman), the over-musical 88 keys (mandy patinkin), and the kid (charlie korsmo). charles durning, james caan, dick van dyke, estelle parsons, catherine o'hara, seymour cassel, paul sorvino and kathy bates also star.<br /><br />oh, wait a minute. i haven't even explained the plot! the plot involves tracy trying - and failing so far - to find some way to nab big boy. simultaneously, some very bizarre events have been going on in town, the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks.<br /><br />of course, the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. if warren beatty was having trouble acting his age, then he made good use of that here. "dick tracy" is one cool movie.
