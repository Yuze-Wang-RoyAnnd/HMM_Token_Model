i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while. sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die, stanley's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant. it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died. my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird. judd nelson is cute, at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell. brilliant movie.
