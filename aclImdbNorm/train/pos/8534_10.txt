eric stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as joel garcia, a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident. while learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition joel befriends slick, fast-talking, charming womanizer raymond (an amazing wesley snipes) and boorish, surly, racist biker bloss (a terrific william forsythe), who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he's forced to share a room with. joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving, but married girlfriend anna (radiantly played by helen hunt). but he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own.<br /><br />this remarkable movie's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through. directors neil jimenez (who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script) and micheal steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste, wit and warmth, specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one's lifestyle, including and especially your sex life (this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when joel and anna try and fail to make love in a motel room). besides the expected poignancy, the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw, earthy humor that's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with joel and bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club. the uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus: stoltz, snipes, forsythe and hunt are all outstanding, with stand-out supporting turns by grace zabriskie as bloss' doting, amiable mother and elisabeth pena and william allen young as compassionate hospital nurses. despite the grim subject matter, the film ultimately proves to be a very moving, positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit. a simply wonderful little gem of a drama.
