made me wish my own happy birds could talk. tisk tisk on the reviewer who dissed the movie. a sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. paulie is a lovable little treasure. he has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh. i especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz stint. you can forgive the obvious clich'es as you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with marie. a charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner. would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey. i liked her artistic and poetic inspirations, a shame she could not share paulie's reunion. bless paulie in his new home, at last with marie, perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.
