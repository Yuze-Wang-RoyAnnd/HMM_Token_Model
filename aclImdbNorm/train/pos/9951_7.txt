if you've ever wondered why they don't make porn with a plot, watch dream quest. on the one hand, you have to give the armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it. on the other hand, it also quickly becomes apparent why most porns never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialog connecting sex scenes together. these people simply cannot act (and the story is, unfortunately, lame to a ridiculous degree).<br /><br />still, i gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there didn't seem to be much of an effort to cut corners. also, i'd like to see more attempts like this one. maybe someday i will see the perfect combination of porn and plot.
