i've seen this film on sky cinema not too long ago.. i must admit, it was a really good western which features 2 of the big names.. on one side, there's charlton heston, playing the infamous and retired lawman samuel burgade. on the other.. the late james coburn playing the villainous zach provo.. seeking revenge on burgade no matter what the cost..!<br /><br />the good thing about this film was there was some really good characters.. most of the actors played it out really well.. especially james coburn, who i find that he was really mean in this film.. but that how it was..<br /><br />christopher mitchum, who i've seen everywhere in other films.. playing hal brickman.. i felt his character was left out in the cold, but he manage to get himself back in by teaming up with burgade, to bring down provo's posse's!<br /><br />all in all, it was a great film.. very good to watch.. great score from the late jerry goldsmith..<br /><br />wonderful piece of western persona..! 8 out of 10.
