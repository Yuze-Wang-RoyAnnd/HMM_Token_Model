everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good to great), the personalities (larger than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture through time). what is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance: chucking mainstream american culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding.<br /><br />i was a surfer in the 1970s. we used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in socal. i remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat, putting on a hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night. often, the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading a script off sheets of paper. sometimes, a surf band or proto-punk band would add music. i was never happier. except for the hooting and hollering, seeing 'riding giants' took me back in time.<br /><br />it also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge, not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder, not keeping up with the joneses, pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question, "what is the purpose of life?" at least for those like greg noll, laird hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue: to live life solely on our own terms. maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams.<br /><br />it was this message that really impressed me.
