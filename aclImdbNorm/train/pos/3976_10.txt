i just saw the drugs years on vh1 and i love it. i think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly it has a strong message to the all generations. there is woodstock, there are joplin's, hendrix's and jim morrison's deaths, there are many many examples of drug use and drug abuse. it completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in america in both good and bad ways. in my opinion this documentary is well done and i would like to congratulate to its creators because this is exactly what is needed to be playing in the tv in these days. i am waiting for the dvd release. you should definitely see it!!! this movie is stunning-- big time!
