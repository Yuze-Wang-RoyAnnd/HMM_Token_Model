the plot doesn't begin to describe the film: a man is writing a film, or rather, *this* film. it's totally self referential to the point that you think it's going to fold in on itself like a black hole. the writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and he writes about it.<br /><br />it's very philosophical, like "waking life" but more zen oriented and for that matter, much better, in my opinion. at one point there are person-on-the-street interviews and then you see shots of these people being filmed, and then you discover that their responses are scripted when one keeps flubbing her lines. there is beautiful scenery and optical illusions.<br /><br />i hope it comes out on dvd so i can watch it again more carefully. seen at cinequest (the san jose, ca film festival) on 2/25/2002.
