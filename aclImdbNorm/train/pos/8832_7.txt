"hey babu riba" is a film about a young woman, mariana (nicknamed "esther" after a famous american movie star), and four young men, glenn, sacha, kicha, and pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 belgrade, yugoslavia. the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything american it seems.<br /><br />the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. in the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).<br /><br />i enjoyed the film with some reservations. the subtitles for one thing were difficult. especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. perhaps the conversational pace required it, but i couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. i watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.<br /><br />this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. there is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.<br /><br />i would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, jovan acin (1941-1991).
