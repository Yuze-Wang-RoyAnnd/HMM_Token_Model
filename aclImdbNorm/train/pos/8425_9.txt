i finally watched these episodes in 2008 and i had to continually go back and verify when they were actually produced. they are absolutely scary in that they made spot on fun of what would be the future. either parker and stone lived in texas and witnessed the idiocy of gov bush or they are those weird, eerie people that pay attention to things. boo, scary! bush's frat bros invading the white house dressed as arabs wielding rifles? bush 'accidentally' executing someone? (no, wait. he did sort of do that as gov.) this may have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time, but must now be considered as brilliant, if spooky, prescience.
