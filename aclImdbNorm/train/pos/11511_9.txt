weak scripts at times? yep! cheesy special effects at times? yep! deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time? yep! more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin? yep! i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid, but found so much of the dracula/frankenstein/mummy/horror stuff as just so much crap. it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters, and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the "dark side" of entertainment. the duke had rooster cogburn, eastwood had dirty harry, garner had maverick and rockford, selleck had magnum, and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak. mixed in with all those weak scripts, cheesy special effects, that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars, there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak. he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger, was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth, and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials. additionally, unlike 98% of us, kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done, even if it meant his demise, the end of his journalistic career, or jail time. for all his faults, including no taste in clothes, carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang (which was an old used car at the time) on his way to save the day for humanity. as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin. now that he's passed on and his show is on dvd, i hope he's having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again!
