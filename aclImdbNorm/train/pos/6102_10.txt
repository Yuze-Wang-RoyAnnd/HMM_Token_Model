i had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have failed miserably to do. this film was void of all the video whore clich'es, and it also skipped the gangsters, rappers, and foul language. it examined several relationships among physicians, african americans, and african american male/female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level. i was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues. the film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time. i saw it at the boston film festival as well. it premiered at amc loews boston and i truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences. black people (and everyone else) would love a movie like this- if only the industry was smart enough to put them out there!<br /><br />as an extra- if your a doctor, a resident, a medical student, a premedical student, married to a doctor, have a doctor sibling, have a doctor in the family, or know a great doctor period- they would love this film as well. it portrayed residency and the practice in a true-to-life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors, residents, and medical students who viewed the film. dennis cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- so he definitely applied his knowledge/experience to the film and that is greatly apparent.
