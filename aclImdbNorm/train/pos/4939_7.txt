this movie is not great, but it is a good and enjoyable one. it feels like an indie film made out of a play script. morgan freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears the script was not written for him. and there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasn't committed to yet. i mean, he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it :)<br /><br />i found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste, but refreshing nonetheless. this is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go. a bit too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me.<br /><br />bottom line: a nice little film, made in two weeks, with basically two actors and a few extras, dialogue driven, makes morgan freeman look good :)
