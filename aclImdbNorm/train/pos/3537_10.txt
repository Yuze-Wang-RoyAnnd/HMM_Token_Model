this james bond game is the best bond game i have played in my life it is my favorite james bond game so far because: <br /><br />the missions in this game are really fun they can be really hard that makes it more fun to play the missions have lots of actions the weapons you use are really good. the cars in this game are awesome the car missions have lots of action and are really fun to play. the voice over actors are really good and it is cool that sean connery does the voice for james bond also the way bond looks is really cool because it looks just like sean connery when he played james bond in the movies and the other character look pretty much the same as the look in the movie. the graphics a pretty good in this james bond game. also the game follows the movie pretty much but not all the but most of the time it does which is cool.<br /><br />overall score ********** out of **********
