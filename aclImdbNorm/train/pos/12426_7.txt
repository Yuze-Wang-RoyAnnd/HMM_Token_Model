david duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in californication - the troubled talent. and it is a role he plays well.<br /><br />this thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end. timothy hutton plays a fine villain and angelina jolie pouts. the story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted. drug addiction and a desire for the sultry jolie mix a heady cocktail. unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the fbi is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene. but, that aside, a movie worth seeing.
