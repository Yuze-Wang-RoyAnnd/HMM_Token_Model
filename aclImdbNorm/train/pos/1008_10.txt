i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons. sadly now the sci-fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more. atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons. and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead. this tv show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it !!!!! 10/10
