no doubt intended as a totally campy joke, "full moon high" portrays 1950s teenager tony walker (adam arkin) accompanying his father (ed mcmahon) on a trip to romania. sure enough, tony gets bitten, and grows fur and fangs whenever there's a full moon. a particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse, and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years.<br /><br />but otherwise, the movie's just plain funny once it gets going. ed mcmahon's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks that everyone should have listened to joe mccarthy), kenneth mars's coach/principal is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. one of the most eye-opening cast members is demond wilson - best remembered as lamont on "sanford and son" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. but probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents; then gag with gerald ford really summed him up! anyway, it's a real treat. considering that alan arkin - who plays a zany psychiatrist - just won an oscar on sunday night and thanked his sons, i wonder whether or not he remembers co-starring with two of them in this movie (aside from adam, his son anthony also has a small role). quite funny. also starring elizabeth hartman.<br /><br />ps: director larry cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick "it's alive".
