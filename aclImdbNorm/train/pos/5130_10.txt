...may seem like an overstatement, but it is not.<br /><br />what is so hard to comprehend is - why didn't they make more musical shorts like this? wasn't the beauty of it totally apparent to everybody involved? i guess not. so many shorts were made for commercial reasons only, and with some luck there may be some artistic value in there. this is one exception - the only one? - where it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art. why didn't anybody ever think to shoot lester or charlie parker on a live date? crazy, man.<br /><br />a pity there were no sequels. if you've seen anything of similar quality please share it!
