there is no such a thing as perfect murder.lieutenant columbo knows that.ken franklin, who is the other half of the writing team of detective stories doesn't know that.he kills his partner jim ferris who had plans on going solo.now columbo steps into the picture and asks all sorts of questions from mr. franklin.and returns for one more question.columbo: murder by the book (1971) is directed by the young steven spielberg before his days of fame.steven bochco wrote it.columbo is a fantastic character with his shabby look.it's hard to believe this man could solve any crime.but he could.each and every one of them! peter falk is the one and only person in the world that could portray this character.so no remakes, please.this part is a very good example of how columbo worked.jack cassidy plays the murderer and martin milner plays the victim.rosemary forsyth plays the victim's wife joanna ferris.there's something endearing in the scenes between columbo and her.how he makes the omelet and everything.barbara colby plays lilly la sanka.she actually met a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here.i've been a fan of columbo since childhood and i still enjoy watching them.there was a break for many years that they weren't showing columbo stories at all but now he's back.back for one more question.
