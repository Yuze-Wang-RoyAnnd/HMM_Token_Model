let's cut to the chase: if you're a baby-boomer, you inevitably spent some time wondering at the fact that, in 1976, mccartney had the gumption to drop in on john's city hermit life and spend the day with him. you also certainly wondered how things went. i heard the exact same reports that the writer of this film heard, from john's and paul's perspective, and i admit that i reconstructed the meeting in pretty much the same way this film does. but none of my imaginings could have bought tears to my eyes the way this incredible piece of work and acting does. i found it amazingly lifelike, perfectly plausible and 100 % saccharin-free. now, can anyone explain why i didn't hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the cbc last night? i mean it's already three years old, for goodness sake! and yes, if you're a beatles fan, this is a must-see performance! even the subtle paraphrasing of beatles' melodies in the background is inspired.
