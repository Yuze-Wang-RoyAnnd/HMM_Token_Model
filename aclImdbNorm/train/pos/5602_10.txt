roman polanski plays trelkovsky who rents an apartment in france.the previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt.he goes to see her there where he also meets stella (isabelle adjani), the friend of simone.he and stella become pretty close.later simone dies.trelkovsky begins to think the landlord and the neighbors are trying to change him into simone so that eventually he would also jump out of the window.le locataire (the tenant) from 1976 is the last film of polanski's apartment trilogy.the previous ones were repulsion and rosemary's baby.roman polanski does not do good job only as the director but his acting is also superb.isabelle adjani with her big glasses is wonderful.the landlord, monsieur zy is played by the great melvyn douglas.jo van fleet plays madame dioz.the fantastic shelley winters is the concierge.the tenant is something very scary from time to time.it gives a lot of that psychological scare.this film is not the easiest one to understand or explain but that makes it all so fascinating.
