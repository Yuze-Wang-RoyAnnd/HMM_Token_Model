it was on at 7:30am, too close to school to see very often. the animation & computer graphics were spectacular for the time. the idea of cowboys & ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles & robots was amazing. maybe it inspired treasure planet.<br /><br />unfortunately, it's really boring in the dvd format. the shows are all basically identical. when viewing non-sequential episodes on a dvd, you're stoned by disk #3. by today's standards, the animation is spotty. we don't notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are instead.<br /><br />the bright spots are the heroine characters. they were a lot more believable, took themselves more seriously than modern heroines, and weren't corny. they actually saved men.
