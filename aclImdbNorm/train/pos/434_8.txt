nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. being a male, i'm probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start. it isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. each has their own "thing" that they contend with. once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have. it didn't try to pound a lesson into us. the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen. good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people.
