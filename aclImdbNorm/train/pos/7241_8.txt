paul lukas played a russian intellectual making his living as a waiter in<br /><br />"grand slam," directed by william dieterle (1933). it is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celebrity. the waiter and the russian restaurant's hat-check girl played by loretta young become america's sweethearts as bridge partners who do no squabble. with the aid of publicist and ghost-writer 'speed' mccann (the wonderfully deadpan frank mchugh) they become walking advertisements<br /><br />for the "stanislavsky system," a "system" of bidding whatever one feels like<br /><br />(since bids are not rational, there is no basis for recriminations about their stupidity).<br /><br />a duel with displaced bridge guru cedric van dorn (sounds close to goren, no? and i suspect the choice of the character's name "stanislavsky" was also a slam at another kind of system), a puffed-up charlatan played very well by ferdinand gottschalk, is broadcast on radio stations across america like a prize-fight by roscoe karns (another great fast-talking deadpan comic actor of the 1930s).<br /><br />the bridge players are even in a roped-off square, though the audience is<br /><br />above them, unlike in boxing "rings."<br /><br />the wide variety of american types prefigures the comedies of preston sturges, though for manufacturing celebrity, "grand slam" most calls to mind two better movies from the same (pre-code) era with lee tracy playing fast-talking<br /><br />publicists: "the half-naked truth" and "bombshell," but "grand slam" has its<br /><br />moments, especially for anyone who has played bridge with serious point<br /><br />counters.<br /><br />loretta young was already a clothes horse. (to me, her face seems a bit long<br /><br />and horsey, too. another era's notion of beauty, i guess...) the movie<br /><br />unfortunately all but drops glenda farrell, who plays mchugh's forgetful<br /><br />girlfriend.
