having developed a critical eye for film, and a love for good cinema, i went to see antwone fisher with my breath symbolically held. while i am an unabashed fan of denzel washington - both of his skill as an actor and of his public persona; i am an honest enough fan to admit the (very few) times when he hasn't quite hit the mark in a film or two. and i could be wrong about those - after all, i am not an actor. but this was different - denzel would pour his career's experience into, and guide, a film handling one of the most sensitive topics known to man - the abuse of a child. as his directorial debut, no less. and develop the film to point that it would successfully present the triumph of a man. i didn't want to be disappointed.<br /><br />and i wasn't.<br /><br />what i did see is a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences, and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief, but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who triumphed despite it all. this film did it - and nary a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it. it takes someone to know the topics in this film to know when truth is presented. it takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you haven't experienced it. and if he can further draw an audience in, and cause an audience to emotionally respond, without pity, the filmmaker has done his job. in any film. black, white, purple or polka dotted. that is what makes good cinema. bravo, denzel washington, derek luke, joy bryant and most of all, antwone fisher - you have indeed won.
