yet another remake of "fistful of dollars", sergio leone's remake of kurosawa's "yojimbo" (suggested by the novel 'red harvest').<br /><br />this one is strictly a b-movie; taken as that, it is rather enjoyable. the direction is crisp, the acting full of verve, the limitations of its 'direct-to-video' photography well-handled.<br /><br />the weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the 'fistful'/'yojimbo' plot to a sub-plot from leone's 'once upon a time in the west'. although leone directed both 'fistful' and 'west', his motivations behind the two films couldn't be anymore different. the 'man with no name' (eastwood) is a borderline socio-path with a soft spot for broken families. harmonica (chaeles bronson) is obsessed with his own broken family, and obsessed with revenge. these two characters would not have had much to do with each other. in order to bring them together, 'gun crazy' has to twist it's plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we're actually following.<br /><br />but this is a b-movie after all, and filled with action and silliness; it's entertaining on that level, just don't expect anything more.
