i thought this move was very good. there were a few things that were less than perfect, but overall, i was quite surprised. the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic, but was real enough to be entertaining. i found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it. being a military pilot i could relate to many of these parts.
