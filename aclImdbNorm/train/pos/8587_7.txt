my take: makes use of its familiar plot with fine performances and a few genuine moments of excitement. <br /><br />the plot is familiar. an innocent man is framed for a plot to assassinate the president of the united states, the first traitor in the united states secret service. as his fellow secret-service agents pursue him, he tries to prove his innocence. of course we know his innocent, and the real culprit is just around the corner, but i was still entertained by the sentinel. in this time where thrillers are reduced to being too ludicrous and too abundant in action sequences, the sentinel is a good lick-back to all those good old-fashioned political crime thriller. the familiar plot is elevated by neat thrilling sequences and terrific performances.<br /><br />michael douglas, the perfect man for the job, is long-running secret service agent pete garrison, who is framed for being part of a plot to assassinate the president. former colleagues in the secret service (kiefer sutherland and eva longoria) pursue harrison while he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the traitor in the secret service. this leads to a lot of chase scenes that, surprisingly (and thankfully), are never unbelievable. the screenplay also offers a subplot involving garrison having an affair with the first lady (played by kim basinger). this thankfully wasn't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films.<br /><br />the films director is clark johnson (s.w.a.t.) who manages to make the film look good. although many have criticized it as "should have been a tv movie", i must disagree. agreed, this is not a perfect film, and much of it is inspired from other action thrillers and political intrigues like in the line of fire or an episode from the tv series 24 (which this film closely resembles when it comes to style and star sutherland), but even so, this film takes its plot into serious heights and doesn't abandon even its smaller details. the performances are terrific (with a top-notch cast, its bound to be, even with the by-the-numbers script.<br /><br />all-in-all, i award it ***1/2, not perfect, but not far from it.<br /><br />rating: ***1/2 out of 5.
