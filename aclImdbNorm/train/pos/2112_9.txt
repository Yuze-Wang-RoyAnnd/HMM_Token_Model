in budapest, margaret sullavan (as klara novak) gets a job as clerk in a gift shop; there, she bickers with co-worker james stewart (as alfred kralik). the two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal. watching ernst lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying. <br /><br />even better is a sub-plot involving shop owner frank morgan (as hugo matuschek), who suspects his wife is having an affair. hiring a private detective, mr. morgan confirms his wife of 22 years is having sex with one of his younger employees. morgan, painfully realizing, "she just didn't want to grow old with me," and the supporting characters are what keeps this film from getting old.<br /><br />********* the shop around the corner (1/12/40) ernst lubitsch ~ james stewart, margaret sullavan, frank morgan, joseph schildkraut
