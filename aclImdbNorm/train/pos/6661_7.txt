from very long, we are seeing movies on gandhi. and mostly, the light is always on portrayal of gandhi as freedom fighter or man with principles. but when i heard that a movie is being made which will highlight gandhi as father and stress on his relationship with his son, it instantly hit my attention as this is one territory which is least being explored as it has his own dark side and less people shown courage to dwell into it. fortunetly, anil kapoor (producer) and feroz abbad khan (director) did.<br /><br />the story start with gandhi working in south africa and his relationship with white people and his wife. latter akshay (harilal) joined his father for becoming a barrister but his dream took overturn when his father (gandhi) pushed (or motivate) him to become freedom fighter. it showcase that gandhi believes more on practical study rather then formal education. harilal too try to walk on his father footstep but soon failed as its infatuation towards his wife, children and his own dream of becoming big success altered his path and then start the repulsion between son and father. he finally defeated his father in terms of pursuing his dream and to left him on his own terms. he written back to india but then start his unsuccessful stories which become bigger and bigger with time. i am leaving reader to see movie to catch further story...<br /><br />performance. first akshay. he has given best performance of his tenure so far and is absolutely convincing in his portrayal as harilal gandhi. the scene in which he reach the room where his wife dead body is placed is one where you can see a fine actor which is hidden/developing in akshay. darshan jariwala is also good as mk gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character. he performed well and with quite an ease. shefali chaya (now shah) as kasturba is brilliant actress and already proved her metal in tv serials. bhumika chawla too performed well but actress of her candidature is waste in these kinds of role. other actor have also justifies their performances.<br /><br />technique and make up is also good and cinematography especially that duo tone color picturisation was too good. costume looks and match with context.<br /><br />overall, a worth seeing movie which is defiantly slow in progress and impatient people may find it boring but give you an insight of area which is not brought to silver screen till date. also, the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me, it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end.
