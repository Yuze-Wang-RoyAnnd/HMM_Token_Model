this movie is why i found this website. i couldn't find this movie anywhere else! i am so glad we found it here! we have seen it on tv before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it. one other poster commented that it is was boring, though i must say that it is not. especially if you are a horse person, you will love this movie. the horses are awesome, well trained and the movie is well done. it is certainly one we will be purchasing for our home dvd library. we will be recommending it to our friends. the bond made between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. this is certainly a movie that we will watch several times.
