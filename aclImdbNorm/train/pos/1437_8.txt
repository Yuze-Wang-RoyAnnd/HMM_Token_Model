we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics, but i still recommend "city hall". in a role he was born to play, al pacino stars as new york's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy. but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect. in this movie, the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal. no matter how much you trust any given politician, you may have your doubts after watching this movie.<br /><br />i understand that i can't name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays, but that's not the point. if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top, this movie tears such ideas down. certainly one that i encourage you to see. also starring john cusack, bridget fonda, danny aiello, anthony franciosa and david paymer.
