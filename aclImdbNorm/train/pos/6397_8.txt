i gave it an 8 star rating. the story may have fallen short about 3/4 of the way into the picture but the performances remained strong throughout."men of honor" was changed from "navy diver" understandably so. anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that "honor" is an appropriate word to use in the title.
