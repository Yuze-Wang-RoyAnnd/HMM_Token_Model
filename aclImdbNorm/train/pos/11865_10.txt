i heard a few friends one day saying that "scarface sucks... some idiot tried to make another godfather set in the early 80s." now, i usualy listen to idiots/watch cnn so i decided i'd stay away from it. then my mate handed me the dvd and said "this is #1 with the pelicangs", confused i tried it. this is the best film ever made. it's more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford (*cough2fast2furiouscough*) there is some humor though... i.e. the pelicangs and the light 80s music. still, whats better than al pacino wielding an m203? i give this a ***** out of ****, perfect for fans of al or gta:vice city.
