tsui hark's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie. unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung (i felt the urge to strangle her while watching this, it's that bad :) made it difficult to watch at times.<br /><br />this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department. when i first saw this, my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that i've never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kung-fu novels! without a doubt this is one of the best-looking chinese historical kung-fu epic ever made.<br /><br />but alas, tsui hark hasn't improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialog are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys didn't help either). to make it worse, this movie is very badly cast. they decided to use the "hot" popular hong kong idols as lead characters, but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody. adam cheng siu-chow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better.<br /><br />i wish that someday zhang yi-mou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and story-telling poetry of zhang...
