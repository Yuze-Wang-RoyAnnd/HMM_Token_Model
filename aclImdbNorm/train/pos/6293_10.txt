buster absolutely shines in this episode, which is the only vehicle i've seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical (and silent!) comedy that made him famous. it's still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing i don't care for, as far as buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled. he even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with roscoe arbuckle.<br /><br />my deepest gratitude to rod serling for presenting us with this episode, and for giving buster's genius full scope. he didn't have much time (one episode) to do it in, but this is a touching tribute to hollywood's greatest genius.
