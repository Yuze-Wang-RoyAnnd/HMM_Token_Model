a wonderful surprise of the spanish cinema. i never thought jordi molla could be such a great director, after all, i really don't care much for his choice in movies. however this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all... something i always enjoy! it hasn't enjoyed much good press and i really don't think it'll ever be released in the us market. we'll have to content ourselves with the dvd or vhs if even that... i don't want to say much about the story because i don't want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it (like sooooooooooo many), before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on.
