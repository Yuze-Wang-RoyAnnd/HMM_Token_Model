this chinese movie made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture i don't belong and are far from. in an almost buddhist approach, the film helps one to relate to each character, and to the happiness of doing the simple routine things.<br /><br /> all actors are brilliant, and xu hzu exudes kindness and wisdom, yet also vulnerable and mean. er min, the retarded brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes to and from the most disparate persons in this universe. a different china, this is far from the chinese realism, yet, it has lots of humanity and realism of a different kind.<br /><br />get it. you won't be disappointed.
