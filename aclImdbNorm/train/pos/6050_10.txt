at last! a decent british comedy that isn't centred around some mockney bank robbers or spun off from a tv series. john ivay's film is a psychoactive tale of discovery, dressed in biker gear. the three protagonists are gentle fools with a penchant for failure and each at a turning point in their lives, giving a sensitive, emotional trio of sub-plots to sew the riotous comedy together. the chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a touching companionship with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedic moments. it feels part withnail and i, part american werewolf in london, and part quadraphenia (but only because of the bike gangs, and phil daniels). in fact, phil daniels' lovable rogue reminds you of danny the dealer in withnail and i, with his scholarly approach and scientific commitment to drugs. this is a great film, particularly for those who've dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past, who will relate to many moments in the film. a personal favourite is the brilliant scene in the welsh corner shop, buying munchies while tripping on 'shrooms. this gentle comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and have you laughing out loud. and you don't have to ride bikes or even like them to enjoy it. but it'll add to it if you do. brilliant.
