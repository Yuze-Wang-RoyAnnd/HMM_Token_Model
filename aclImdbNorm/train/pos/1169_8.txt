stylish, moody, innovative revenge-driven bloodbath. also cheesy, of course, and sporadically very cheesy. it reminded me a lot of the big heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event, and the girl comes around to the good guy's side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy. it's sad there's no gloria grahame but so fantastic that it's alain delon and not glenn ford. could there be anyone as beautiful as alain going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? yet he's totally tough and icy cool. no one nowadays can touch him--though someone like jude law could try i guess. hard for any girl to look good with him. the music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases (and those aren't generally my cup of tea)--especially one willy nilly one in the woods. people also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion, for instance in a junkyard cruncher. but beyond the cheese, the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off. more creativity, excitement and freshness in that "forgotten" movie than most of what i've seen lately.
