this movie is wonderful.<br /><br />i was 'enchanted', i should say, and surprised because of how uniquely it was done. the cast, the sequencing, the effects...everything! magnificent! i mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining, wholesome manner.<br /><br />for me, it is the representation of modern fairy tale. it's like the modern peter pan...simply amazing<br /><br />i surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the market.<br /><br />this movie is really a double must see one...!!!! 10 stars for that!
