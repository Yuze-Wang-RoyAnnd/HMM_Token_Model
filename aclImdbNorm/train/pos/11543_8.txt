neil simon has quite a body of work, but it is the odd couple that carried him to fame. this film really works. jack lemmon & walter matthaw have a great chemistry. the supporting cast for this film is stellar as well.<br /><br />it is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets. the script bristles with humor from this situation. this had been done in some forms previously. this is the one that brings it all together in a very good package.<br /><br />simon has done some other decent work, but this one is really his best work which made the rest of his work possible. it is hard to imagine simon ever topping this.
