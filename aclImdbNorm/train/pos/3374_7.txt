"soylent green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards. although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. this film's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic. the new york of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company. charlton heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... the script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. the riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema. edward g. robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive role for joseph cotton ("baron blood", "the abominable dr. phibes"). this is science-fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! no fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
