if ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone, disabled or not, to persevere despite the odds and make it (even when "make it" as an expression, proper, can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth), my left foot is it. it's a hard film to watch at times: seeing the less placid aspects of christy brown's personality emerge in two key scenes -- one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction, and at a dinner table when the woman who's reached out to him, made him able to communicate effectively, now has announced at a key moment (the inauguration of brown's art) she is about to marry another man -- is tough. very, very tough. more so because this is a man who cannot react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how: via screams, shrieks, and profanities aimed at hurting himself. however, this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account, but that of a man overcoming his severe disability, becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world. daniel day lewis won an oscar for his powerful, unforgettable performance as the flawed but tenacious christy brown, and brenda fricker did so as well for her supporting role as brown's solid mother.
