saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it. i work in the jane finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community - grit, determination, exuberance, creativity, in your faceness with a dose of desperation. the writing, dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process. great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well. all the characters are multi dimensional - none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong. this is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth, hip hop and communities like jane finch.
