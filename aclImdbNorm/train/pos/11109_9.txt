the sopranos stands out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of american life, and how the american experience is shaped and defined by money. by setting the story in the milieu of the underworld, david chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt, low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post-modern era. <br /><br />every character represents a facet of american industry. tony soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff, torn between familial duty and a need to keep his "business" on an even keel. the convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward. the characters of christopher, paulie, and bobby reflect the loyal - but self-serving underlings present in every enterprise, who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit. with the character of ralph, joe pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who's flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power. and dominic chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old-guard, which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up- and-comers to deflect blame.<br /><br />though abrasive and occasionally disturbing, the sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate tv drama. <br /><br />ps a good companion piece to chase's series would be the shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting.
