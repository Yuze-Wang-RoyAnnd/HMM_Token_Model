what a great film it is. the notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky. the ending is not just a fitting one, it's more inspirational.<br /><br />but i am intrigued by the characters. it is a pity we never see the relationship of achilles and athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and athena's fear for achilles's safety. their romance is very enjoyable.<br /><br />
