i really like this show. that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist, and that he fired masiela lusha off the show, simply because he discovered that she wasn't a latino emigrant, but was an emigrant from albania. i learned this from people on the show. she was really one of the better parts of the show, and thus, to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism, that they can also hate someone, just because of the country where they were born, is really disappointing. i really like this show. that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist, and that he fired masiela lusha off the show, simply because he discovered that she wasn't a latino emigrant, but was an emigrant from albania. i learned this from people on the show. she was really one of the better parts of the show, and thus, to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism, that they can also hate someone, just because of the country where they were born, is really disappointing.
