i found 'time at the top' an entertaining and stimulating experience. the acting, while not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. as a film obviously aimed at the younger demographic, it is certainly one of the better works in the genre (children's sci-fi). normally, i would say that canada, the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children, and 'time at the top' does nothing to discount this theory! i don't think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people. a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them. both are in abundance in this film. the special effects are good, without detracting from the story, or closing the viewers off from their own imaginations. it would have been very easy to inject an over-load of sfx in this film, but it would have totally destroyed its entire 'raison d'etre'. <br /><br />the settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie, and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy. overall, this film is highly satisfactory, and i recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through children's eyes, or those that try to, like myself! now, i really must read the original book, as soon as possible.
