the feel of this movie was amazing. adam sandler's performance was very inspiring. as he played a very rattled and fragile character, he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role. his character was really interesting. i can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as sandler made me. for someone who plays primarily comedy roles, he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input. i especially loved the scene in which adam and don's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city. i familiarized with the moment, because it seemed like don was witnessing one thing adam does to get away from it all. with his video games, music, and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts. this movie is definitely worth the watch.
