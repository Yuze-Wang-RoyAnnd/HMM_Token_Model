the late, great robert bloch (author of psycho, for those of you who weren't paying attention) scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies i ever saw as a kid. (i had to walk miles just to see a movie, and it was usually dark when i emerged from the theater; seeing a horror movie was always unnerving, but particularly so when it was as well-executed as this one.) when i had the opportunity to see this one several years ago on videotape (which should always be a last resort), i was surprised at how well it held up. take the terror test: watch it at night, alone, and then tell me it's not scary...
