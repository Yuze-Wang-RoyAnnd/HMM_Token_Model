like most people, i've seen jason priestley on tv and i think he's great. but i didn't know he had a sister! justine priestley is simply "mah"velous as the scorned other woman. good music, intrigue, and a death scene involving amanda's revenge on an abusive dr. that will stay with you for weeks. i'll leave it at that. kudos.
