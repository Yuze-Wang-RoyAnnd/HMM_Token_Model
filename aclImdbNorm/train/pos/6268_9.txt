carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance! the pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going. the flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them. although the story isn't strong, the action is fun and draws you to the very end (which i felt could've had a sequel).<br /><br />campy and dark, this is great ol skool kung fu!!
