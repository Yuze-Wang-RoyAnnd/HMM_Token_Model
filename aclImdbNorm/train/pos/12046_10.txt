there is nothing remotely scary about modern "horror" which is an insult to the word "horror". freddie vs jason, the scream movies, cabin trash, and especially stephen king's infantile attempts - he's recycled every story from the monkey's paw to whatever, often in the same story - at horror in both writing and on film (except for kubrick's version of the shining which actually was scary, unlike king's books which are as frightening as my big toe - the left one, which still has the nail.<br /><br />but the woman in black is that rare modern film that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. this is the way it should be done; the director creates tension, and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other with that incredible look on her face. then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close. he's learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror - val lewton (original cat people) and robert wise (a val lewton disciple and director of the haunting and the body snatcher), jacques tournier (another val lewton disciple who directed a truly horrifying zombie film, not the gross rubbish raimi did (gross isn't scary, folks, it's just gross), and lewis allen (the uninvited), and of course jack clayton's turn on henry james the innocents, and the way the master of suspense, hitchcock, can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow-building and burning period piece like under capricorn.<br /><br />ten stars...
