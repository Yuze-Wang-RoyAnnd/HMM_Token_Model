good historical drama which is very educational and also very entertaining to people who like history.very good acting and script.not as sensual and sexy as it is sometimes marketed,be prepared to peek into the pioneer spirit and human ability to adjust.very touching as well for the spiritually mature. not for people who do not like to think......
