well, if you are one of those katana's film-nuts (just like me) you sure will appreciate this metaphysical katana swinging blood spitting samurai action flick.<br /><br />starring tadanobu asano (vital, barren illusion) & ryu daisuke (kagemusha). this samurai war between heiki's clan versus genji's clan touch the zenith in the final showdown at gojo bridge. the body-count is countless.<br /><br />demons, magic swords, shinto priests versus buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro sogo ishii will do the rest.<br /><br />a good japanese flick for a rainy summer night.
