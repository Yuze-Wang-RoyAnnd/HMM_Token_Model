punctuating the opening credits sequence is a swarthy man having a strange, all-too-real nightmare. closing in on its dystopic 2054 paris, the film begins to follow a woman into a grungy club, where she and a slavic bartender convene outside on the deck. they toss exclamations at each other to the effect that she owes him more money although she believes she's paid it all. another woman obstructs the budding violence, only to have a bitter fight with the woman herself. the initial woman storms out, and she is kidnapped. christian volckman's renaissance appears to be another one in an assembly line of recent motion-capture-animated sci-fi noir pictures, but in spite of whether or not that is essentially true, it tells a neatly arranged, classically unraveling detective story that keeps us in the dark in its opening minutes, even whilst introducing karas, the hard-boiled cop we recognize from the beginning as the man awakening from a terrible dream.<br /><br />the rudiments of classic film noir are all hit upon without any anachronistic changes, for all intents and purposes. it is in the harshness of its monochrome that volckman's french thriller has followed no example. for the film's animators, unfettered by the challenges of physical lighting that would normally be faced, have been able to begin with a totally black frame, and to affix utter pitch-white according to the action on screen. as they scrupulously imitate the effects of real light sources throughout the frame, the distinction of black and white here is full-blown without even any of the slightest shades of gray to tone with the characters' less starkly definite moral codes, and the outcome is a harsh and judgmental vision of the direction in which commercial civilization is going, sporadically caused to undergo the most blaring and ruthless of illumination. it is the artistic study of film noir taken to their visual boundary of its philosophy, and nothing before has ever shared quite the same execution of this visual concept.<br /><br />all the characters in this decent cyberpunk film seem as if to have been walk off with purely from a gothic comic book in black ink, but all together their physical responses, their motions and the nuances of their facial expressions look ashore within a clear humanity. normally, films that try out new developments in animation allow their technical advances upstage all other facets of production. sin city, for example, left substance and overall good screen adaptation from its source material to be desired.<br /><br />it may not be mind-blowing, it may have its narrative conventions and its voice-over cast may simply be adequate, but renaissance, made for $19 million over six years, not only feels like actual noir instead of a rashly penned appropriation, but also is not secondary to all the visual innovation, which is played as if to be incidental. one leaves thinking not so much about how cool it is when karas is evading bullets shot through a crowded glass parisian street, but more about its ponderance of life and death, how life's tragedies, such as death, make life meaningful.
