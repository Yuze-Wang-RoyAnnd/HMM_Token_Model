this is one of the all-time great "our gang" shorts. spanky is at his very cutest and funniest, and the babies that he get's left to babysit are also hilarious. tiny spanky is coerced by the gang into watching all their little siblings. the opening shot of them all in baby carriages, being entertained by various things hung by the gang from fishing poles is a beautiful gag.<br /><br />spanky's appearance wearing his huge toy knife when asked to babysit by the older fellows is priceless, as is his response --"hey, where do you get that stuff -- i don't take care of no babies!" the tiny fellow saying "remarkable" throughout the film, all the beautiful sight gags, and spanky telling the babies "all about tarzan" add up to make this one of the best "our gang"'s you'll ever see.
