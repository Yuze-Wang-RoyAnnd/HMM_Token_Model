the men can slaver over lollo, if they like (or her lollos--she gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in french), but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine gerard philipe, who is not only beautiful but can act. don't be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple, dashing story of love and war, in which all is fair, they are not needed. all you need know is that, at the beginning of the film, lollobrigida reads philipe's palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king. thereafter the story is quite plain from the gallic gestures and the running, jumping, and swordplay.<br /><br />on the minus side, the obviousness of the story and the heavy-handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying, and it is annoying that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts. and of course the non-french-speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh-la-la, such as: virtuous girl: i must tell you that my heart belongs to fanfan. seducer: my dear, what made you think i was interested in that bagatelle?
