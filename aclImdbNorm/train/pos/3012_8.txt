this is one of those movies that you wish you hadn't seen before - so you could see it again " for the first time " . van dine's books still bring pleasure - but are termed excessively flowery by many . this movie is by far the best film adaptation of his works . william powell is william powell - say no more . the plot is intricate . the story moves all too quickly , because you want it to last . enjoy.
