this movie was made in hungary i think. anyway,the countryside is gorgeous,the people who play the farming folks were totally fascinating. their horsemanship is awesome. i got more into the native people, the farm life, and how heroic they were trying to hide brady from the evil nazis who where looking for these parachutists. they even sacrificed their life in several instances. the young orphan lad that brady befriends was a sweet kid. you will marvel at the riding i think, and the action of trying to evade the nazis. it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others. ladies have hankies handy, as you will be devastated at the end. i own it, and have watched it several times. in other words, not just a one time around flick. its a keeper....
