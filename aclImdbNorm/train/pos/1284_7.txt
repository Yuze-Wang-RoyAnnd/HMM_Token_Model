i watched the babysitter as part of bci eclipse' drive-in cult classics (featuring crown international pictures releases) on dvd. i think it is a very good film.<br /><br />this movie packs a lot of story into a very short time. you have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail, and murder, all in one spot! <br /><br />the lead actors do a credible job. and, i found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interesting.<br /><br />however, the supporting cast, primarily the bikers, delivers a stilted performance, particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words. perhaps they used real bikers, instead of actors. a couple of the characters, in particular, were exceptionally believable.<br /><br />the musical score is absolutely spot-on, for the times, the tempo, and for moving the story forward. i found the music a real treat. i noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of "the food," i googled them; but, couldn't find anything...<br /><br />in any case, george e. carey who wrote, produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much (of a wayward married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulation; and, a little help - of course) that he wrote, produced and starred in "weekend with the babysitter."
