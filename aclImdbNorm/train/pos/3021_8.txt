but it's worth watching for boyer, lorre and paxinou. greene's entertainments that were filmed during the war either required transplanting to american shores, as in this gun for hire, or the use of american actors in roles where they did not fit. bacall fits that part here. i kept waiting for her to whistle and bring bogie to life; her tone of voice is simply all wrong for an upper class englishwoman. but listen to the dialogue! no, people don't talk that way except in books, but greene was sending a message about an england that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world. one other positive note: greene's range of characters were kept whole. while mr. mukerjee resembled more a brahamin, at least his nationality was kept, and his final conversation with paxinou is priceless.
