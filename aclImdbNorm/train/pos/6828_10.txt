broadway and film actor-turned-director john cassavetes (from rosemary's baby)creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film. it stars gena rowlands, john cassavetes himself, ben gazzara, joan blondell, paul stewart, zohra lampert, laura johnson and there is a cameo by peter falk. the premise of the film: an aging stage and film actress (gena rowlands)re-evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph. the movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality. it has a 60's cinematic look and it even reminded me of polanski's rosemary's baby without the supernatural horror. the fears here are the ones every successful actress has- she is getting old and she will become useless in her career. furthermore, she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity and merit. she has lived only for her career- she has no children, doesn't do charitable deeds, etc. the gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. she is falling apart. she's in a crisis. gena rowlands really gets into the character's tormented psyche and acts the part quite well. she is a terrific actress and this 70's film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers. it's a movie with lots of deep-seated emotion but has a cold, cynical feeling, as if cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70's generation. either that or this movie is a product of the 70's which was itself cynical in many aspects- nixon's deception, watergate, vietnam, etc. although the production values are not great, and this film is not well-known, it's a very haunting film with haunting moods. kudos to the underrated and late director cassavetes who died in the late 80's.
