the accountant shohei sugiyama (k^oji yakusho) is feeling bored with his routine life, limited to hard work and stay at home with his wife masako sugiyama (hideko hara) and his teenager's daughter. one night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of mai kishikawa (tamiyo kusakari) in the balcony of a dance school, and a couple of days later, he decides to visit the school and secretly take ballroom dance lessons every wednesdays night. however, he becomes ashamed to tell his family his secret. meanwhile, masako feels the changes in the behavior of her happier husband, and hires a private eye to investigate whether shohei is having an affair.<br /><br />i have just finished watching "shall we dansu?" and i really loved it. what a lovely and delightful movie! the story is amazingly good, with drama, comedy and romance. the cast is excellent, and i was particularly impressed with the cold beauty and graciousness of the wife of the director masayuki suo and professional ballet dancer tamiyo kusakari. on last september 06th, i saw the american remake of "shall we dansu?" for the first time, and i found it a delightful entertainment. but now i can say that it is another unnecessary remake, and i recommend this original film instead. my vote is ten.<br /><br />title (brazil): "danca comigo?" ("dance with me?")
