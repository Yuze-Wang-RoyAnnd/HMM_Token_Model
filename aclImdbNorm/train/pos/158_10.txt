i've seen this film more than once now, and there's always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the plot afterwards. but then - this is part of petzold's game: he plays along with the rules of genre.<br /><br />it's very nice, how the highly improbable story of how the two girls (timoteo/hummer) meet, is again mirrored in another, even more improbable story, that the girls make up for a casting. this film is a journey between fact and fiction, it's more about potentials, things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future, than it is about actual ongoings. it's a reverie, sorts of - so apt enough there are a lot of motives, freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis, like all the "doppelganger"-constellations. <br /><br />also, i think, "gespenster" might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny: petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive, strangely familiar way. this film is not about the obvious. to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphaned mother, who searches europe for her lost daughter, clearly doesn't say much about the nature of "gespenster" at all.
