i saw the movie recently and really liked it. i surprised myself and cried. this movie is in the same niche genre as "away from her" - or even "the bucket list" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. it's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar. the director does a masterful job with the challenge. hagar's hard to understand. her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />the first scene gets this across without any compromise. hagar (ellen burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. she figures it out en-route and freaks out. her edges are really hard. she is mean. she is belittling and selfish. she is a stone. i didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. we find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... i started to see the angel... and i started to like her. i especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. ellen burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. kudos. kudos. kudos. what a scene!<br /><br />this isn't a "feel good" movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. i understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...<br /><br />hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i've watched the stone angel.
