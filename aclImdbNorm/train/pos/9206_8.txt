we do not come across movies on brother-sister relationship in indian cinema, or any other language or medium. this relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels. typically, a sister is depicted as a pile-on who can be used for ransom in the climax. this movie treats the subject in an entirely different light.<br /><br />it is inspired by george eliot's novel "the mill on the floss". the brother is very prosaic, all-good, the blue-eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother. the sister is romantic, wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society. in spite of this, the love of the brother-sister is the winner.<br /><br />this movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later. it is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world.<br /><br />although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries, yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true.
