i thought that ice age was an excellent movie! as a woman of 30, with no children, i still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. sid is the best character i have seen in some time, better than bartok in anastasia (although he was really humorous, and i did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than melman in madagascar. i have seen the movie at least 15 times (i own it obviously) and i quote the movie at work (on many occasions...yes,still). my favourite scene is the part where sid says "oh, oh, oh, i love this game!" and sid and manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the "tigers"..."pack of wolves, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pack of noses, pack a derm?, pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish..." or however that part goes! that is the funniest part about the whole movie, although i also really enjoyed the humour behind "putting sloths on the map" and many other parts as well. the only animated movie that can remotely compare to ice age is "brother bear".
