i'm feeling a little protective of this film because it was my introduction to the u.n.c.l.e.-verse. the year was 1972, and i.t.v. ran all eight features in one bumper run ( followed by re-runs of 'the persuaders' starring tony curtis and roger moore ) on saturday evenings. 'the karate killers' was chosen to open the season. it commenced with a cool action sequence as solo and kuryakin's sports car got attacked by a squadron of thrush mini-copters. i was a fan for life from that moment on.<br /><br />after the main credits ( nice to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action footage ) we go to the laboratory of dr.simon true ( jim boles ), inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater. true's wife amanda ( joan crawford ) has been having an affair with thrush agent randolph ( herbert lom ). a ruthless fellow indeed, he kills both the doctor and his wife, before hunting for the formula. true has prepared for the event - he has divided it into five segments, each written on a photograph of himself, and sent it to his five daughters, all of whom are scattered throughout the world.<br /><br />solo and kuryakin set out to get the formula first, leading to a string of episodes in different locations, and cameos from the likes of telly savalas ( as a tight-fisted italian count ), terry-thomas, and curt jurgens. one of dr.true's daughters - sandy ( kim darby ) - accompanies the u.n.c.l.e. boys on their global quest.<br /><br />having assembled the formula, thrush turns up and makes them hand it over, before whisking them off to their secret base at the north pole...<br /><br />of all the u.n.c.l.e. feature films, this is the one i feel should have been produced specially for the cinema. it hurts by being a television product, albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual. no location filming was done, and the various segments come across as repetitive, usually culminating in a scrap between u.n.c.l.e. and thrush. of the cast, joan crawford is memorably hammy in her small role, and curt jurgens badly miscast as a sugar daddy. as a london bobby, terry-thomas is as delightful as ever, and herbert lom good as the chief villain. kim darby grates though as 'sandy'. she should have been told to stay at home.<br /><br />what is surprising about this is that it manages to be more amusing and entertaining than many official cinema releases of the time, including 'in like flint', 'casino royale' and 'the ambushers'. i'd love to know how solo and company escaped from thrush h.q. after randolph's death though.
