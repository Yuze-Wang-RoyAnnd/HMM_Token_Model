i adored this movie. not only because i am a big fan of moritz bleibtreu, although he is in practically all german movies that count. but also because he is not the main actor. the lead is taken over by barnaby metschurat, who was the only reason to watch 2001's julietta, and who really carries this movie on his shoulders.<br /><br />a family moves from italy to germany seeking "the german dream" (this is my own invention and ironic...) of cheap labor in steel and coal industries. however, they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. from this point onward, the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family, giancarlo (bleibtreu) and gigi (metschurat). gigi's dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to italy. what follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can become formed by the choices you make.<br /><br />in the end, this movie doesn't say which life (gigi's or giancarlo's) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. it merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved. and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country, which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration. the fact that director fatih akin's moved to germany from turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy. the icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast, especially metschurat and - this i really need to stress - the little boy who plays young gigi. that kid's performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone! great movie, go see it.
