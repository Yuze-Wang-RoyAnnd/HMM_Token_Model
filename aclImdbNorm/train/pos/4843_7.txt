as a matter of fact, this is one of those movies you would have to give 7.5 to. the fact is; as already stated, it's a great deal of fun. wonderfully atmospheric. askey does indeed come across as over the top, but it's a great vehicle for him, just as oh, mr porter is for will hay. if you like old dark house movies and trains, then this is definitely for you.<br /><br />strangely enough it's the kind of film that you'll want to see again and again. it's friendly and charming in an endearing sort of way with all of the nostalgic references that made great wartime fare. the 'odd' band of characters simply play off each other as they do in many another typical british wartime movie. it would have been wonderful to have seen this film if it had been recorded by ealing studios . a real pity that the 1931 original has not survived intact
