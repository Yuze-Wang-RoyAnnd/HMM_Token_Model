i loved so much about this movie...the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack...<br /><br />it has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick. if we lived in elizabethan days, i'd say this movie's a bit like a shakespearean tragedy. but since we don't, let's say it's more like a drama-suspense movie.<br /><br />the plot is simple, but the story is complex. the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. much of the story is shown rather than told, which i find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling.<br /><br />i don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case i do. (though i did enjoy the book too.) i've bought the dvd, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary.<br /><br />(i also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after i saw it for the first time, because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him. he loved it - and the discussion.)
