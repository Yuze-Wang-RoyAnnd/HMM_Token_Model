i think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie! or damn australian? i still don't know, but what i know is that i really liked this movie but that couldn't be my favorite movie!<br /><br />great story with great actors but with a terrible end... to make you cry and say 'oh, she's so good'... still, who made it? what really happened? who's that guy? no answer to these questions...<br /><br />mysterious movie with a good mark overall... i give it a 8/10, going on the 8.5!
