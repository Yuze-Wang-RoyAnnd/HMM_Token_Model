some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous, but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them, this is also a film a film of an acquired taste! <br /><br />my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'the thing' i.e the parasitical aliens from outta space, infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible!<br /><br />you can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror/gore genre, however cleverly maintains its own originality, well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival! only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host! to then pick another fight with another infected host! and this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away.<br /><br />great! but like i said of an acquired taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like the film. it is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty, with the creatures/aliens/things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons, i.e saws, drills, blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent. i found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next!<br /><br />so if you like gore, you like aliens, you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere, then i must recommend this film as a must see. i just wish i came across this earlier then i did!
