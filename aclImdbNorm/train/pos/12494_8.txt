finally, an indie film that actually delivers some great scares! i see most horror films that come out... theatrical, straight-to-dvd, cable, etc... and most of them suck... a few are watchable... even fewer are actually good... dark remains is one of the good ones. i caught a screening of this film at the south padre island film festival... the audience loved it... and my wife and i loved it! having no name actors, i assume the budget on this film was pretty low, but you wouldn't know it... the film looks fantastic... the acting totally works for the film... the story is good... and the scares are great! while most filmmakers focus solely on the scares, they often forget about story and character development, two things that help to deliver the scares more efficiently. brian avenet-bradley must know that character and story are important. he develops both to the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters, and are therefore more scared when they are in danger.<br /><br />watching horror films that cost anywhere from $80 million to $5000 to make, i find "dark remains" to be one of the gems out there. check this film out!
