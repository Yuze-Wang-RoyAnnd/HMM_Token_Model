a featherweight plot and dubious characterizations don't make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is. lively action and spectacular stunts - for their day - give this movie some real zip. and there's some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads. quinn makes a good villain also, although his role is completely overshadowed.<br /><br />but don't be fooled by maureen o'hara's tough broad role, this is as sexist as any hollywood movie of this era. you might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made, but it's still hard to get past. for all the heroism and gruesomely adult off-screen situations, this is still little more than an adolescent good time.
