i went to this movie only because i was dragged there and i would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and i felt out of place. however, the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people. the characters were all very real and believable and i found myself discussing the film, the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards. there are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better. all in all, this is a great and valuable film - slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film cannot be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream. it's a thrilling and interesting movie experience.
