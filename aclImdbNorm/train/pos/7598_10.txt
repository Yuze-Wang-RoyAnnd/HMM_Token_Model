"lost", "24", "carnivale", "desperate housewifes"...the list goes on and on. these, and a bunch of other high-quality, shows proves that we're in the middle of a golden age in television history. "lost" is pure genius. incredible layers of personal, and psychologically viable, stories, underscored by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word, when describing a tv-show), a killer score, great performances and editing. anyone who isn't hooked on this, are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever. it may have its problems, when watching only one episode a week, but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this. hope they keep it up (as i'm sure they do).
