had this movie been made a few years later, i would have given it a lower score. however, for 1909, this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today. just don't try to compare this silent film to later silents--the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century don't look at all like movies made in the 1910s and beyond.<br /><br />this movie is 11 minutes long (about average for most films back then) and is a variation of the edgar allen poe story, the cask of amontillado. while many are familiar with the story, i won't elaborate further as i don't want to ruin the film. just suffice to say that it's very creepy!!
