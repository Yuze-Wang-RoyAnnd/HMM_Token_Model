*****spoilers herein*****<br /><br />what really scares you? killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath?<br /><br />maybe. but those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one's own child. "pet sematary" taps this base, primal adult fear, and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore.<br /><br />i've read comments about this film that include poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc. i disagree. the acting is actually first rate for a film like this. maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. but the film's events are not only logical, they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. this is the true horror of "pet sematary": it isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does. despite warning, or even past history.<br /><br />the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect. and the results are horrifying. in fact, when the film dives into slasher territory near the end, it's almost a letdown, although i believe it's perfectly logical how it got there.<br /><br />i am a true horror fan, and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made. if you don't think so, see it again after you have children.
