i meant that in a good way, believe me. true to life, it ain't. the whole oirish thing gets kinda thick, but you do enjoy the cast here-flynn, smith, bond, watson, frawley, etc. all good. i also liked seeing mike mazurki-of course he played a boxer, what else? typical forties flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scenes, one after the other.<br /><br />flynn is fine as gentleman jim, you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here, i suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and meant to please, that's all. the boxing scenes were pretty good, ward bond's vaudeville logging act a riot, and you hadda like seeing all those billyclub wielding bobbies come racing into the scene a couple of times.<br /><br />really alotta fun, flynn was on a roll at that time and it's clear to see why audiences loved him.<br /><br />*** outta ****
