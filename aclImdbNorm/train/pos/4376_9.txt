liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century. he is a true actor. he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary. mary is such a beautiful woman. it's her love that makes rob roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love undying. they need each other. tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find cunningham disgusting. the scotland scenery is beautiful. the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. if you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy rob roy. there is violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. and you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a scottish accent. one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. it's their skill as actors that attracts you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. this is something special.
