citizen x tells the story of andrei chikatilo, the ripper of rostov, who killed 52 people in 8 years time, mainly women and children. it shows how the investigation was obstructed by soviet bureaucracy, how hard it was to investigate the crimes. it does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no-one untouched. in the beginning it's perhaps a little bit slow of pace, but it really grabs you as the story unfolds. i can only say that, next to "the silence of the lambs", this is by far the best movie about a serial killer i've ever seen. <br /><br />it is very hard to say which actor's performance stands out above the rest in this movie. stephen rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation. donald sutherland's performance as his cynical superior, and the only person in the russian government willing to help him, is as outstanding as rea's. and what to say about jeffrey dumann, playing the serial killer? dumann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred. yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad figure, oppressed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his co-workers... he is tortured, ashamed, as well as extremely vicious.<br /><br />i can only recommend this movie to everybody who's interested in a well-made docu-drama, where the actors are still more important than the special effects. it deserves at least a 9/10, perhaps even more if you ask me.
