an ultra-modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and deadly) behavior. or at least that is what lara flynn boyle's character, col kennedy, argues. after a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door, col knows something has got to give. mark-paul gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect.<br /><br />my opinion: the house next door works because of lara flynn boyle and the locations (beautiful house) and stylish sets. boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention absolutely stunning. she brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing. without her, it would have failed. "it's so alive" declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house. yes, it is alive. but the story itself is not so much.<br /><br />barring boyle's presence, not much is happening here, as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. the results are predictable. but i liked it anyway. the cinematography lends the film a polished look. 8/10 on account of boyle, the premise of an evil ultra-modern house, the locations and cinematography, and set decoration and wardrobe.
