without a doubt, 12 monkeys is one of the best films of the sci-fi genre and director terry gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality. an apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound, 12 monkeys never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout. excellent use of philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place.<br /><br />bruce willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen. he is actually sane, but the people of the future (or present if you will) distort this guy's head so bad through time travel, no wonder he unravels. he gets sent to world war i just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the army of the twelve monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it. they finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance, we get to see willis, madeleine stowe and an ominous brad pitt cross-referenced over the course of 6 years.<br /><br />stowe is sensual and solid as the risk-taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that willis may not be as cracked up as he seems. a captivating element of the relationship between her and willis is their sense of "seeing" each other before, in another place or time. 12 monkeys is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present, when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world.<br /><br />the brooding city of philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for willis' plight to complete his mission which is, against all usual hollywood stereotype, not to save the world. he is gathering information. the film plays tricks on the viewer as well, placing willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin. this must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but gilliam seems to be the master of hard-boiled movie making. he even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like time bandits, and brazil. the screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget films. if you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 monkeys.<br /><br />rating: 9 of 10
