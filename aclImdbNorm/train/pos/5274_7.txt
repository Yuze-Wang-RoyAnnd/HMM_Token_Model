yes, i loved this movie when i was a kid. when i was growing up i saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another vhs copy because the old copy had worn out.<br /><br />my family received a vhs copy of this movie when we purchased a new vhs system. at first, my mom wasn't sure that this was an appropriate movie for a 10 year old but because we had just bought a new vhs system she let me watch it.<br /><br />like i said, this movie is every little boys dream
