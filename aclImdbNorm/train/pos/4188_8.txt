samuel fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films. while "shock corridor" and "the naked kiss" represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of america and "the big red one" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, "merrill's marauders" painted war as necessary hell and "pickup on south street" is about the dangers of communist spies. all of his films make for very entertaining viewing, and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b-filmmaker, fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors. "pickup on south street" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the film-making style is remarkably ahead of its time. its also a very quickly-pace, tight, and occasionally brutal film noir.<br /><br />the acting across the board is fantastic. richard widmark makes for a great anti-hero and jean peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend. the show stealer is thlema ritter however, in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie. the angles fuller employs are great, making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal (this is very violent for its time). the camera continuously moves around just as tarantino and his school would do forty years later. "pickup on south street" is a great action-paced noir thriller. "shock corridor" remains my favorite fuller film, but this is a very close second. (8/10)
