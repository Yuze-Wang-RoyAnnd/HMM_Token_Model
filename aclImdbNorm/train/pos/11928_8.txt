this movie, while seemingly based off of a movie of the same title in 1951 released by mgm and starring janet leigh, is still a great film. danny glover in one of his best performances brings george knox, a down on his luck baseball manager with a short temper, to life. as for this movie being "stacked", how about adding christopher lloyd (his stage experience works and shows through in his performances on screen, a wonderful actor), joseph gordon-levitt (third rock from the sun), brenda fricker (a charming and well seasoned irish actress), tony danza (yes even he is good in this film), matthew mcconaughey (he stole the show in dazed and confused, and his role may not be as pivotal in this film, but he got exposure), adrien brody (what i said about matthew mcconaughey goes the same for adrien, except the dazed and confused part), some great character actors like taylor negron (david), tony longo (messmer), jay o. sanders (ranch wilder), neal mcdonough (whitt bass) and a seasoned veteran in one of his final performances, ben johnson (hank murphy, the owner of the california angels), and the rest of the cast does a great job, plus a great storyline that is uplifting to pretty much anyone, i don't care what recesses of depression you're in. i loved this film as a kid, and it brings back memories when i watch it today. i need this on dvd. i recommend it to any parent who's looking for something their kids have not seen, and everybody else, for that matter.
