joyce reynolds seems a might grown-up for the role of janie, a boy-crazy sixteen-year old in small town america who ditches her steady guy for a visiting soldier and winds up on the cover of life magazine (smooching at a blanket party) all in the same week! non-stop barrage of wisecracks, put-downs, bull talk, and unfunny bits of business such as janie's little sister bribing family members, hattie mcdaniel (as the maid) constantly scuttling after sassy kid sis, janie's mother involved with the red cross, and janie's father trying to write an editorial on the problems with today's teenagers (as the parents, stuffy, sexless edward arnold and pert, chatty ann harding make an unlikely couple, even for 1944; he looks incapable of helping to conceive a child much less raising two of them). nominated for an academy award (!) for owen marks' editing, warner bros. followed this in 1946 with "janie gets married". reynolds must have outgrown her co-horts by then--she was replaced by joan leslie. *1/2 from ****
