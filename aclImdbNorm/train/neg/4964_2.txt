this movie is a farce! names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast. and they have the gall to give beowulf a ridiculous cannon/crossbow weapon. beowulf doesn't need a weapon like that! in the poem, he rips off grendel's arm with his bare hands! and i can't believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing. the way grendel is portrayed is impressive however. that and the cast are the only positive points of the feature. my english teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination. unless you are a die-hard fan of the epic poem "beowulf," avoid this film at all costs. and even then, i wouldn't recommend it.
