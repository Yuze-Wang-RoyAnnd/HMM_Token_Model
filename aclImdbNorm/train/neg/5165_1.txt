i was looking forward to this ride, and was horribly disappointed.<br /><br />and i am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park rides.<br /><br />the roller coaster part was just okay - and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride. <br /><br />it was visually dull and poorly executed. <br /><br />it was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior indiana jones and space mountain rides and disneyland, and failed in every aspect.<br /><br />it was not thrilling or exciting in the least.
