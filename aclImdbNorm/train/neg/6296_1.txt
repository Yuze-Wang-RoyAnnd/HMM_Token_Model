this film looked interesting; i'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly.<br /><br />started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations. in fact, i didn't bother watching the whole thing... utter drivel - bad performances, bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters - that was the point of the film, i guess.<br /><br />watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend.<br /><br />do not bother with this feature.
