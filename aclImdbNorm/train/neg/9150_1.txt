i made the big mistake of actually watching this whole movie a few nights ago. god i'm still trying to recover. this movie does not even deserve a 1.4 average. imdb needs to have 0 vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one. a 1.4 is too high.<br /><br />i had heard how awful this movie was, but i really did not think a movie could actually be that bad, especially in this day and era. i figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s. my god was i wrong. trust me folks, this movie really is that bad. it is beyond horrible; it is beyond pathetic; it is beyond any type of word that i can think of for it. battlefield earth looks like best picture of the year compared to this movie. snake island (which up until now was the worst movie i'd ever seen) looks like it deserves a few oscars compared to this pathetic effort.<br /><br />i seriously can not believe that the makers of this movie thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a hollywood movie. this has no business being called a movie. in the first 25 seconds of the film, i seriously thought i was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie. or better yet, i thought it was some saturday night live ripoff skit of the real thing. i mean, it looks exactly like that. the acting is horrible; the whole movie almost looks like it was shot with a 20 year old vhs video camera. the special effects.......well good lord bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie. the scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy. i mean seriously, my intro to acting class from 4 years ago in college, all of us could have put together a better movie than this. and the worst part of the entire movie, where arthur is naked in the bathroom. oh my god i almost thew up right there. i have a strong stomach, but wow that was horrible. some people should never be naked, and he's one of them. the plot of this movie just seems to go absolutely nowhere. they talk about legal issues that we never hear about again; ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again; arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is he's running a porn shop. everything about the movie is just horrible.<br /><br />this really doesn't have much to do with my critique, but just so everyone knows, i am not a gay man. i do however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals. and i would support any gay person in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this movie, who by the way seems to cuss every other word. (where is the f*(#*ing white out?) hahaha but i didn't want anyone to think i hated this movie just because of it being about two gay guys. it has nothing to do with that: this would have been just as horrible of a movie if it was ben & jill instead of ben & arthur.<br /><br />i just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say. and yes it was even worse than i had read. let this be a warning to everyone: only watch this movie if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century can still be. if you watch this movie and are actually expecting a good movie or some entertainment, i have no sympathy for you whatsoever.<br /><br />on a final thought: how in the world are there 7 movies ranked below this on imdb? there is no way there are 7 movies out there that are worse than this!
