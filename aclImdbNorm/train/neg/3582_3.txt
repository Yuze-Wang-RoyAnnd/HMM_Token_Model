no, it's not the horror movie...this one is actually a love story.<br /><br />the ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them. she loves the boxer known as "one round" jack. she loves him until the champion comes along, that is. even though she marries one round, she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion. she comes back to one round's corner, just when things look their bleakest, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back.<br /><br />this film was very early in hitch's career, but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film. although there are special film tricks, and some comedy relief, this film just does not hold up to any of his later work. it must have been extremely risqu'e for the time period though, with the shameless adulterous wife. that may have been the draw back in 1927. while looking through all of these old films, it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on today's screen and really come off. maybe i should be the one....<br /><br />skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcock's films. you could fall asleep in the middle.
