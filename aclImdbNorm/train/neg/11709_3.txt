you've heard it said to live every moment as if it's your last? whether it's your last day or not, i beg you not to waste any part of it watching this! nichole hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy (that alas, stays wrapped) and david deluise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials. a shallow, unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no "art" in the "art of revenge".<br /><br />
