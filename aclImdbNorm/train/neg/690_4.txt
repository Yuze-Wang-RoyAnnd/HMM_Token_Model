if you've ever seen an eighties slasher, there isn't much reason to see this one. originality often isn't one of slasher cinema's strongpoints, and it's something that this film is seriously lacking in. there really isn't much that can said about pranks, so i'll make this quick. the film was one of the 74 films included on the dpp video nasty list, and that was my only reason for seeing it. the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at christmas time. as they're in a slasher, someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because, despite a few gory scenes, this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone, and gorier slashers than this (friday the 13th, for example) didn't end up banned. but then again, there's banned films that are much less gory than this one (the witch who came from the sea, for example). anyway, the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it, as although the audience really couldn't care less who the assailant is by this point; it is rather well done. on the whole, this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss.
