ivan reitman is something of a savior. the most tired plots (ghostbusters, evolution) come to life in his skilled hands. even his occasional flop (six days, seven nights) show signs of life and humor that make it worth viewing. so i was disappointed that reitman could not take a fairly original plot (man dumps superhero, superhero gets superpower-fueled revenge), and shape it into something enjoyable. "girlfriend" is an exercise in pointlessness. the one-trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. the film can't decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama. the result is a film the flip-flops between both, with neither aspect being very well done. uma thurman is tops, as usual, and luke wilson pulls off his role too, though his slacker antics quickly grow tired. what's even more maddening is that, in certain scenes (such as when a very turned on uma knocks a headboard through a wall), you sense a witty, raucous reitman opus practically screaming to get out. but seconds later, the magic is lost, gone as quick as the superheroine whose movies disappoints in almost every way.
