i went into this movie hoping for the best. i like wartime musicals in general. dick powell and lucille ball did good jobs with their roles; however, the writers gave them boring dialog. the love-interest between the two of them was not given any real growth; just suddenly it was there. i did not think much of the music; the best number was the snippet we heard of spike jones with "der fuhrer's face." the one complete number that spike jones did had little of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff,even with the monkey. bert lahr's comedy skits were interminable.<br /><br />there were parts to enjoy: lucille ball was quite a looker, and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen.
