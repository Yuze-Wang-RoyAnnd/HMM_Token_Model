...but i regret having seen it. since the ratings on imdb are relatively high (and they must also have been relatively high on netflix), i guess i put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the uk, a category that has produced many films i liked immensely. "saving grace," on the other hand, falls into the category of laugh-less comedies usually populated by hollywood movies produced and directed by the talentless. brenda blethyn is a capable actress, and i have liked her in other movies. the concept -- a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she finds herself confronting after her husband's death -- does not offend me. notwithstanding the strenuous efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor, the film falls flat on its face (falling flat on its arse might have been funnier) as far as i and my wife were concerned. be forewarned, oh gentle reader, not all offbeat british comedies succeed. this one is a dud.
