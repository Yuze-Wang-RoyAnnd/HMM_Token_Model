i think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest. the presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work. hydrogen filled flying bladders? they would need to be the size of a mack truck to be useful. and then there's the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. i have no problem with fantasy, just don't try to pass it off as fact. some folks will always misunderstand. all in all the film is entertaining, but i constantly found myself saying "oh brother, what a load of ....". if you want a fake documentary, watch this is spinal tap instead. or at the very least turn the sound off.
