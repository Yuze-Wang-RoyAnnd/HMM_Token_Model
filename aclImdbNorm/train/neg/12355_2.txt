after reading through many of the reviews, i don't know what movie some people were watching, but clearly it wasn't the same one i saw.<br /><br />this movie is horrible. the acting, primarily moore's, is just terrible. the woman cannot act. nice tits, but she just can't act. at no point did she come across as the actual character. instead, it was spoiled hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make-believe with the boys.<br /><br />and that's what this movie ultimately is -- hollywood make-believe. the training sequences are over the top. the politics -- over the top. the political correctness -- over the top. the combat scenes -- you guessed it, over the top. your mission is to get in and get out without being detected. so what do you do? why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible, of course. oh g.i. jane, you can be my wing man anytime.<br /><br />the premise is good, but as soon as hollywood gets a hold of it, we end up with top gun with tits.<br /><br />what more is to be expected from commercial us films anymore? not much i guess.
