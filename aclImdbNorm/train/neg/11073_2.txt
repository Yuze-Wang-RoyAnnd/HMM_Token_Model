this is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a canadian. we grow good wine. our writers and poets are among the world's best. the national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. but we make bloody awful movies! this one isn't especially bad. it's especially typical and typically bad, shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction, high school level acting and "gee whiz...lets see what this button on the camera does??" photography. if michael moriarity was so intent on doing a jack nicholson impersonation, couldn't he at least have done a good jack nicholson impersonation? and if the movie was shot in vancouver, truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building (part of the "plot") why in god's name do we let that endemic canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as seattle??? not only am i mad about this film, i'm embarassed and more than a little ashamed. the australians turn out some splendid stuff. we produce pretentious second rate piffle. gawd!!!!!
