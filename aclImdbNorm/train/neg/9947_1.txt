this movie was horrible. i swear they didn't even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie. ice-t was annoying as hell. *spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it* they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. he coulda been long gone. the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs. and when ice-t is on that hill and uses that spaz-15 assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle (and then cuts down a tree with eight shells?? it would take 1000's of shells to cut down a tree that size.) shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards. and they even saw the reflection. what reflected the light?? i didn't see a scope on that thing. also when he got shot in the gut and kept going, that was retarded he would of bled to death right there. plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel. it wouldn't blow up and kill him. the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel.
