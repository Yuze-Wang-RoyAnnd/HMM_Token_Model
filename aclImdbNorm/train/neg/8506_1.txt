this may actually be the worst movie that i have ever scene. incoherent would be a compliment. even the end made no sense but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over. i watched it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate and it did. by the end of this mess i was sorry any of the characters survived and i wasn't feeling too charitable about the actors either.if you want to watch a train wreck, i recommend hanging out at a train station. even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess. apparently i haven't vented enough to fill up my prescribed ten lines so, at the risk of redundancy, i will say it one more time. this movie is a zero and it would be less if i had a word for an even lower rating. how about minus zero?
