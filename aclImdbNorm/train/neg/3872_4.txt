the movie never becomes intolerable to watch. and to tell it straight, it has nothing to show either, except maybe part-sexy alicia silverstone in a nerdy non-sexy character in revealing quite-sexy dresses. the story is very easy to follow or there's nothing to follow -- you can see in either way. there is no suspense, little action, unimpressive dialogs, unsatisfactory sensuality, same boring locations and very bland acting. kevin dillon is totally worthless. silverstone... well, i didn't concentrate too much on her acting, i confess. yet as i said earlier, if one has nothing to do except watching a movie, this won't look so bad. 4/10
