a question for all you girls out there : if a man you`ve never met before accidentally phoned you up on purpose and continued to do so at the most indiscreet moments would you be intrigued by him or so freaked out you`d phone the police ? yeah that`s what i thought so i couldn`t swallow the idea of marti gerrard putting up with the unwarrented attention of connor hill<br /><br />***** mild spoilers *****<br /><br />this is a really dumb story . connor hill`s wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question is connor phoning marti so he can have an alibi ? but there`s a massive gap in logic here , couldn`t connor have employed a hit man ? something the prosecution seem to have ignored . and wasn`t there any forensics at the murder scene ? so why does the whole trial rest on connor phoning marti at the time of the murder ? dumb . dumb . dumb . and it`s as predictable as it is brainless .<br /><br />my abiding memory of this film is that for someone who made the winter olympics marti gerrard is a really crap downhill skier
