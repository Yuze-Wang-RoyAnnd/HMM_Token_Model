quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well. what is it? what is it about will smith that i just can't stand any longer? i guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an oscar. i understand how bias this is, but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons i can't ever see him winning one. he's a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor. he's just not. i give him credit for trying so hard, and being able to cry at the drop of a hat. that's about it.<br /><br />seven pounds was kind of an eyeroller for me, right from the start. the suicide 911 call didn't intrigue me in any way. i wasn't curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide. there were absolutely no surprises. the best i can say is that will smith and rosario dawson had some decent on screen chemistry. also, i don't know her name, but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife. woody harrelson had very limited screen time, but i'd say he stole the show whenever he was on.<br /><br />all in all, just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot. i couldn't help asking myself the whole way through why i cared about any of these people. never once felt sorry for 'tim/ben'. he killed himself with a jellyfish? was the only survivor in an 8 person accident? geewiz..didn't see any of that coming...<br /><br />5/10 is pretty generous.
