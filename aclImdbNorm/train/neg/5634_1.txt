the poster who called this "plotless and pointless" literally took the words i would have used in my subject line. the only thing i'd add is "passionless." for a film made by a real life married couple and featuring lots of graphic sex scenes this movie manages to make what should be a sultry situation into one beyond ice cold. dafoe and colagrande look bored during the sex scenes, and the viewer might as well take a valium and have done with it. also, please, the women in the audience have seen way too many used tampons in their time, and any guy who is turned on by seeing willem dafoe pull a bloody tampon out of his wife's vagina really needs to get therapy.<br /><br />i think the key to the film (if there is one) is the restaurant scene where a waiter explains to the perpetually sleepy-eyed dafoe what a "deconstructed jambalaya" is. (all the ingredients of the dish still separate rather than simmered together.) this movie is a "deconstructed thriller". all the elements are there: spooky, isolated house, dead spouse,creepy violins on the score, weirdo caretaker who comes and goes as he pleases, auto accident deaths and near deaths, characters with a secret past. basically every thriller clich'e you can think of, but nothing comes together. everything just sits there and never meshes into a coherent plot or even an artsy mood piece. at the restaurant, dafoe passes on the "deconstructed jambalaya". prospective renters of this mess would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the video store shelf.
