<br /><br />i saw this on the sci-fi channel. it came on right after the first one. for some reason this movie kept me interested. i don't know why, stop asking.<br /><br />---spoilers--- okay... it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie. in the first movie, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the killings/attempted killings were basicly for no reason. stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? no cast, no movie. he wanted it to "look real when they died"? if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie, use the special effects, man. of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and stanley ends up getting messed up, and dissapears. woooooow (sarcasm). this movie had potential. and the saddest thing of all... the really sad part... i would watch a "cabin by the lake 3". only because i like judd nelson, and he's the only good part about this sequal.
