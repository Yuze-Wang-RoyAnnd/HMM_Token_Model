this movie is a modest effort by spike lee. he is capable of much more than this movie.get on the bus while apparenly anti racist, does nothing but berate whites and degrade the black status quo. the plot of this movie is about a group of black men who travel on a bus to louis farrakhan's million man march. the bus has every type of person you could imagine:gay, muslim, gangbanger and the uncle tom(he is thrown off the bus though). there was one only white person on the bus. he was accused of being a racist the minute he got on the bus to drive. despite him being a jew and the fact that he explained is situation he ended up being a racist and leaving the bus.i hate to say it but films like this need to realize their own hipocracy and rienforcation of steryotypes. this should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment. you may think i am a racist for writing this but i mean well. better luck next time spike.
