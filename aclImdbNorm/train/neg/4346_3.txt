why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, i can say that there is little if anything from the original book. i went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these.<br /><br />this is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. this is not the story of carlito brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. they have just totally spat in the face of every carlito's way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting luis guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role.<br /><br />what's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book carlito's way - something i really would have liked to have seen. i felt the same way about chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a ho-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though eric bana's performance was spot-on). now we will never get to see carlito's real initial rise and fall.<br /><br />the three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (jay hernandez is no carlito but he could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. even puffy combs suits his role. but they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (i am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge edwin torres).<br /><br />the fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.
