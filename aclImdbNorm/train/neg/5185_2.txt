a complete waste of time<br /><br />halla bol is a complete waste of time. the script and dialogues are poorly written, the direction is lacklustre and the acting borders on hammy.this movie was clearly aiming for the rang de basanti crowd but it falls far short of the mark because it does not have even one of the elements that made rdb connect with its audience_great script, terrific acting, good direction and a powerful social message that was never preached but shown.<br /><br />compared to that near-masterpiece, halla bol takes a step backwards by resorting to scenes such as the hero taking a leak on the villain's persian rug and the hero's mentor staring down bullets in a truck no less! all of this might have been acceptable in the 80s when there was a downturn in movie quality and bad movies like divyashakti and phool aur kaante became big hits, but movie-making has become_should have become_more subtle and thoughtful of late.<br /><br />rajkumar santoshi is a capable director and i appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he makes but maybe he simply does not know how to do it! he resorts to sermonizing without a care as to the audience's intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say. maybe he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave the social messages to the rakeysh mehras and aamir khans.<br /><br />even if you don't agree with everything i say, you will agree that throughout the screening you will be thinking that rang de basanti was much much better and mr.santoshi should have left the industry-bashing to om shanti om. industry-bashing? that's right!!santoshi has depicted the industry as a place of back-biting, bitching and the casting couch which the hero happily indulges in with a starlet curiously named sania. there are some people who will think that these portions show the real face of the industry. don't believe everything you see!<br /><br />all in all, raise your voice against movies like this and don't spend your hard-earned money on this bomb.<br /><br />* out of ****.
