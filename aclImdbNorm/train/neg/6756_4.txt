devin hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary full moon entertainment. sadly, his arrival to this independent studio happened in a time when budget and production values are at its lowest in years. however, in his short career hamilton has established himself as a creative director that manages to make inventive and original stories. now, this doesn't mean that his movies are good, but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre.<br /><br />in his debut, "bleed", hamilton presents us a creative twist on the slasher sub genre. maddy (debbie rochon) is a young woman that finally gets the job of her dreams. not only that, but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in shaun (danny wolske), it seems that life finally smiles for maddy after many sad events. until on a party with shaun's friends, they tell her that they created a "club" where members have to kill somebody to enter.<br /><br />obviously they are joking, but maddy wants desperately to fit in, that she actually murders someone. after that event, someone starts to kill the rest of the members of the "club" one by one. it is up to maddy to figure out what is going on as anybody could be the killer, including her.<br /><br />maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful debbie rochon. it is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects. the concept is so original and rochon's performance is so good that it is a real shame that hamilton didn't develop the whole story a little bit better. the movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie.<br /><br />the rest of the cast is weird in the sense that all the female cast is very good, while the male cast is painfully bad. danny wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical. julie strain, brinke stevens & lloyd kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles. also, there is lots of nudity (both male & female) and the cast is very good looking, so it is really a plus.<br /><br />the low-budget hurts the film in the effects department, as there are very few gory scenes and are not really graphic (probably because they would look bad); nevertheless, considering the budget, the film at least looks good.<br /><br />hamilton's more recent effort, the sexploitational venture "delta delta die!", is a better crafted and overall funnier film. while this one is not as bad as other better known films, it still has a lot of flaws and may be interesting only for fans of debbie rochon or fans of independent no-budget films. 4/10
