well let me say that i have always been a steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just don't measure up to the rest. this in my opinion is very stupid i did not like it all. the biggest reason i don't like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense. the acting is very bad even steven seagal does not do good acting, the rest of the actors i can see because they just do direct to video movies. it does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesn't make much sense. ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it. the special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake. so all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a steven seagal movie don't rent this one just pretend it does not exist. so just avoid this movie.<br /><br />overall score: ** out of ********** <br /><br />* out of *****
