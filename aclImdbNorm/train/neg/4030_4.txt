i remember watching "lost missile" (actually throwing a fit until my brother and several cousins at whose home i was an overnight guest agreed to watch it with me - i was, from time to time, the eric cartman of the 1960s - sorry, guys) and being somewhat embarrassed when the sustained wave of million-degree heat emerged as a plot device - even as a second-grader i knew that a mere missile just couldn't carry the energy around for that much heat or devastation over more than the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation. <br /><br />my inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a self-punishing crime.<br /><br />the film's production values were very good. the acting isn't bad (apart from the shatnerism of the actor who played governor's aide that someone else here mentioned).<br /><br />but the idea of a missile easy-baking the surface of the earth by means of the heat of its exhaust... no.<br /><br />how'd the people at "mystery science theater 3000" miss "the lost missile," anyway? <br /><br />it's a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch it if you want something to drink beer to some weekend.
