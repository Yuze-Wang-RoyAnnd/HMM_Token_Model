definitely one of funny man eddie murphy's lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child, three hundred year old dragons and a "chosen one".<br /><br />murphy is the "chosen one" in question, and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world". a finder of lost and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious tibetan woman (charlotte lewis) who tells him he is "the chosen one", and that it is his destiny to find and rescue "the golden child". for if the child were to die, compassion would die with him, as he is the bearer of compassion.<br /><br />if all this hocus pocus rubbish hasn't ruined it for you now, it surely will once the movie begins. suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film. meant to be another vehicle for murphy's egotistical brand of humour (the comedy isn't so great mind you), the movie fails on many levels. even charles dance as the evil sardo numspa can't do much for proceedings. very silly and disappointing.<br /><br />sunday, december 12, 1993 - t.v.
