well, i hate hollywood, but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters. and, i was hoping vanilla sky would be good. i was hoping that they would either keep the original "open your eyes" exactly the same, or they would make it their own. well, it happened to be a little bit of both, and it sucked.<br /><br />it started out good. i love radiohead. i wish there was more of that. but by the end we are listening to good vibrations by the beach boys. talk about a wide range of suck between. they had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others, but why oh why did they have to blare gv during the climax. it was more annoying than confusing or blatant. especially when it has nothing to do with the plot. at least put some meaning behind the songs. kid a = primary. whatever.<br /><br />he also did a bang up job with the club scene. that was cool. otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance. as if audiences would get the movie. the ones that would get it read subtitles, and the rest won't. its as simple as that. the motivations got all screwed up. i didn't comprehend the diaz motivations (hadn't they done the chicken soup night before?) and some of the others. and i hate kurt russell. stay overboard. tom cruise can't act (especially in these types of movie [i.e. eyes wide shut]). and the elevator. i get it. anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe hadn't screwed it up.<br /><br />2/10 major disappointment.
