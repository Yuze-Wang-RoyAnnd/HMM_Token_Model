this esteemed production has it's fans. but to paraphrase the classic bad review of 'mary reilly,' moby dick is like a painting, only slower.<br /><br />this is because the philosophical grounds for a movie "production" are never to make a great film, rather it's to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case for a books transference to film) with a list of hopelessly atomized, undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they've seen greatness. as viewers & critics are apt to fall for this, oscars follow, feeding the whole dumb equation.<br /><br />i don't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found. moby dick is stunningly uninvolving. actors dutifully recite essays about jonah, moby dick, the ocean, moby dick, moby dick... all things that can't respond, and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest. it's dramatically inert. it doesn't build. in narrative terms moby dick (as a movie) is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story. after half an hour i was muttering "oh terrific... another oath ...another 4 minute soliloquy!"<br /><br />in the failed effort to involve you, it's a pretty campy overacting showcase. a lot of grey hair here. starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!)<br /><br />one knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else's paintings & palette, or reverently embalming a classic as huston does here. paintings and books are nice but they're a different mediums. a movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap (village of the damned) is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture. this is the eat your vegetables school of film-making.<br /><br />one appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie, but not the narrative. only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting; the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work & various sea efforts; and the technology of whaling. and that doesn't call for a two-plus hour movie.
