i can fondly remember bo derek's heyday and the uk press attention (the mucky sun & news of the world papers especially)- all following her small role in "10" with dudley moore. understandably, much fuss was made of her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts. <br /><br />unfortunately, acting is, and never was, her forte! i think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain dvd bins- orca, tarzan the ape-man and bolero. all these films could be nominated for the "so bad they are great".<br /><br />it would be a guilty "must buy" of mine! should you ever read your press, or this comment ms derek, please do not be offended- always had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability. much love.x
