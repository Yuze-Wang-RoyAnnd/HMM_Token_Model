i got lured by the title... i was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism, instead i got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a rowdy scot.<br /><br />the leading character isn't given much psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify cheesy teen-like poetry as psychology.<br /><br />it was a shame, because the core of the story could have been good, with a better effort to depict the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth.<br /><br />sadly, the general idea seems to be more like "i'm the way i am because that's the way i am". and the laughingly bad attempt at giving some sort of poetic edge to a lower-class man makes things even worse. resorting to the overused clich'e of the "po`ete maudit" reeks of a quick fix, a cheap way to make a dull movie seem smart, artsy and meaningful.<br /><br />but "16 years of alcohol" isn't much smart, artsy or meaningful... the leading character doesn't evolve at all, and the feeble attempt of changing fails without a good explanation. just like the initial attempt happened rather out of the blue.<br /><br />the movie borrows heavily from classics such as a clockwork orange and trainspotting, but it ultimately fails to recapture their greatness, not even for a few seconds.<br /><br />jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story, and neglected the rest, giving us a movie which is pleasant to the eye but insipid to the brain.
