this is a classic example of an increasing problem with films. why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue? what sense does that make? this film isn't alone. most films seem to do this now. for 2 years, i wondered if it was just something wrong with my tv, but then i got a new tv & there it is again. background noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors drowns out the dialogue.<br /><br />it was even more distracting in this film because, in the english version anyway, the woman mumbles constantly. i kept hoping jean reno would say "excuse me, would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth." if you watch it on dvd & you have even high-school french, i recommend the french version with subtitles.<br /><br />i give it 4 because reno was so good in leon. people rave about the scenery, but i saw it on a tv & i lived in the rockies for a few years, so "enh".
