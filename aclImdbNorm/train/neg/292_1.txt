i saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as i thought sandra was quite funny from what i remembered. the only facial movement i had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie i just suffered through.<br /><br />the person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line, just one scene, that is even worth a chuckle.<br /><br />she is a much better singer than i remember her to be, but i didn't want to watch a lounge act.<br /><br />i think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't view it objectively.
