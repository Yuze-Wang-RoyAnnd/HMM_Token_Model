writer/director peter greenaway cements his title as the high lord of art house pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self-indulgence, 8  1/2  women. the film follows a wealthy englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction, as they lure and blackmail women (guess how many) into joining their personal collection of concubines.<br /><br />think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive, and chances are greenaway's done it. the female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of. there's the kabuki-obsessed mio, the ever-pregnant giaconda and beryl, who's got a thing for farm animals. giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, she's the "half woman," get it? greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny, but if this isn't it, then what is?<br /><br />the film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with japan, a continuation of themes from his snore-worthy (but less sexist) 1996 film, the pillow book. but where the the pillow book was erotic and graceful, 8  1/2  women just gets horny and exploitative. greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism, and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself.
