istanbul is another one of those expatriate films that errol flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the irs. it's a remake of the fred macmurray- ava gardner film singapore from a decade ago.<br /><br />unlike that studio product, istanbul has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the golden horn. but errol flynn, who was aging exponentially before the camera in every film, was way too old to be playing these action/adventure types any longer. his scenes with cornell borchers really do lack conviction.<br /><br />as for cornell, she plays errol's former sweetheart who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia. she both doesn't remember errol and is now married to torin thatcher. <br /><br />but errol's got some nasty people led by martin benson and werner klemperer who are after some diamonds which have come into his possession. got to deal with them too.<br /><br />best reason to see istanbul is to hear nat king cole sing and play the piano. most people today don't realize that cole was an accomplished jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer. actually he was a pianist first, the singing was an afterthought.<br /><br />istanbul is a routine action/adventure film for those who are fans of that type of movie.
