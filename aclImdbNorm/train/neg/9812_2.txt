not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip-off of 'misery'. however, the main reason i gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted me.<br /><br />i'm not someone easily shocked by what film-makers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factor.<br /><br />i think most people, when watching just the first ten minutes of 'hide and seek', will find themselves reaching for the remote.
