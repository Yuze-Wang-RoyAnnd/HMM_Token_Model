having enjoyed mike myers previous work (waynes world and saturday night live) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. it became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as puerile and unfunny as possible. i swit ched off after ten minutes. i watched it the other day a second time to see whether i had been unfair the first time. i switched it off after ten minutes. i find it hard to believe how even a twelve year-old boy could find this funny. the dialogue is an e mbarrassment, myers is painful to watch (as is heather graham) and the succession of characters including fat bastard makes matters even worse. apart from the mildly amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. i personally recommend you avoid this like the plague, though several friends of mine enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).o
