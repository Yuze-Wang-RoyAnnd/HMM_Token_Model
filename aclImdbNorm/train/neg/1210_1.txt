where to start...oh yea, message to the bad guys: when you first find the person you have been tracking (in order to kill) that witnessed a crime you committed, don't spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away. message to the victim: when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing, take that opportunity to "run away", don't sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear. message to the director: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot, you can't have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away! time and motion doesn't work that way. it would also be nice to think that a woman doesn't have to brutally kill( 4) men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home.
