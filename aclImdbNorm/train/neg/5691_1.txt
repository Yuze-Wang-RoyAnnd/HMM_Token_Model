consider for a moment what it must be like to be uwe boll. somewhere, perhaps in those places that jack nicholson said 'you don't talk about at parties', boll knows that david lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him. gore whores, metal-heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the teutonic helmsman's output so bereft of originality, wit or imagination that he's become the internet's bogeyman
