i think if you are into the sixties kind of thing, as i am, you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck. the saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early (and embarrassing) footage. it's as if the producers of laugh-in sat down and decided to write a full length film, covering all the high points (and more) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment, then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $10,000 budget to complete it. hardly a classic, but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was, the silliness, the over-idealism, and the uptightness of the establishment. clearly not for everyone.
