typical troma-trash, this smutty 80's flick is considered one of the "highlights" of lloyd kaufman's notorious production studio, alongside "the toxic avenger" released one year earlier. "the toxic avenger" is far superior if you ask me, but this demented splatter-flick is nevertheless endurable as well; just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door. the events take place in tromaville, a little town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and they certainly aren't lying. the safety precautions in the local nuclear power plant are substandard, to say the least (even homer simpson never was this nonchalant) and toxic waste seeps through to the nearby high school. the first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd, who starts spurting green stuff out of all his body cavities, but his death is believed to be an accident because he had no less than two microwave ovens in his house! oh, the humanity! shortly after, however, the nuclear leaks also affect the school's weed plantation and thing really start to get messy. after smoking a joint at a party, the cutest couple in school produce a gigantic worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum. "class of nuke 'em high" is bottom-of-the-barrel horror film-making, with dialogs so dumb they hurt your ears and make-up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless. if you enjoy watching faces melting away, getting crushed or splitting in half, this is definitely a must-see! unlike the aforementioned "the toxic avenger", this film suffers from a couple of really dull and overlong moments where nothing really significant happens, like for example when chrissy and warren try to figure out what's wrong with their hormones. the crude humor isn't as effective as in "toxic avenger" and the acting performances are unforgivably amateurish. proceed only if you're an avid troma-fanatic.
