"the bat people" is a proud resident of the imdb bottom 100. every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list, depending on whether there are new movies with paris hilton in the lead or documentaries about american idol stars, but it always reliably returns sooner or later. and why? because, unlike the majority of crap in that list, "the bat people" is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz! this nearly isn't the worst film ever made, since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity, but it's still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing. the script is incredibly boring, with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity, and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film. other than a sensible screenplay, the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make-up effects
