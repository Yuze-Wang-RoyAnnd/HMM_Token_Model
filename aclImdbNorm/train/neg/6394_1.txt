this movie was bad. this movie was horrible. the acting was bad. the setting was unrealistic. the story was absurd: a comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. people's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. no bones, nothing. thats ridiculous. how can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?<br /><br />even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. the insane clown posse scare me more...and they're supposed to look stupid.<br /><br />then there were the survivors. people who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. how can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?<br /><br />equally insulting is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, or the 80's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television.<br /><br />the stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two valley girls and chakotay from star trek: voyager. these three characters were totally unrealistic. who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? there were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. in between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes south park seem intelligent. the silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. i could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of cheetos. don't see this movie, ever.
