i rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. i figured that you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of ex girlfriend with super powers. <br /><br />... but the movie was confused and pointless ...<br /><br />it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in. also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love.<br /><br />it seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of fatal attraction super hero .. but i guess not. <br /><br />this is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be. you could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date. <br /><br />if the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up - the movie might have a fighting chance. <br /><br />a serious waste of time.<br /><br />b
