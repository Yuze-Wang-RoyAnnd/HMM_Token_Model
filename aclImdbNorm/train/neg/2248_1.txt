this film is a huge steaming pile. <br /><br />i have no idea why anyone felt that the garland/mason version needed to be redone, nor why striesand would have been a first choice to star.<br /><br />for that matter, i have no idea why our people (gay americans) tend largely to regard striesand as some kind of treasure. at least in my opinion, she had peaked professionally with with funny girl, and bogdanovich's what's up doc. <br /><br />do yourself a favor and rent the judy classic, or even the original (a fine film in its own right), but please, please, please skip this stinkpot!
