i actually felt bad for the actors in this thing. no doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job. the actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film, it certainly was not. besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable. the one about the remote control didn't even make any sense. to bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch.<br /><br />i'm all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. i only watched it because of some good comments posted here. they must have been planted by people with ties to the film. you may fool people into watching this, but you can't fool them into liking what they saw.<br /><br />i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming. sure it failed miserably, but it tried. i reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and skip this dribble. i wish i had.
