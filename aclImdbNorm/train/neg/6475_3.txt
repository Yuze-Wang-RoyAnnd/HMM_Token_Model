though i've yet to review the movie in about two years, i remember exactly what made my opinion go as low as it did. having loved the original little mermaid, and having been obsessed with mermaids as a child could be, i decided i'd take the time to sit down and watch the sequel.<br /><br />disney, i've got a little message for you. if you don't have the original director and actors handy...you're just looking to get your butt whooped.<br /><br />in the sequel, our story begins with a slightly older ariel and her daughter, melody. my first big issue was that eric and the rest of the crew sang. yes, i understand that disney is big on sing-and-dance numbers, but really, that's what made eric my favorite prince. he was calm, collected, and a genuine gentleman that knew how to have fun. and he did. not. sing.<br /><br />and then there's the villain. oh, how could we forget the shivers that coursed down our spines whenever ursula slunk onto the screen, terrifying both ariel and audiences around the world? unfortunately, that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister, morgana. nothing was ever, ever said about morgana in the first movie; she just pops out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. oh, how cute. the younger sister is ticked off and instead of going after the trident, decides to kidnap a month-old baby. gag me.<br /><br />other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her, morgana was just very unorthodox. the same plan as her sister, the same minions (who, by the way, did not scare anyone. i had a three year old on my lap when i watched this movie, and she laughed hysterically.) she had no purpose being in there; i'd like to have seen mom be the villain. i'm sure she would have done a better job than little miss tish over there.<br /><br />king triton held none of the respect he'd earned from me in the first movie, and don't even get me started on scuttle, sebastian and flounder. triton was a stern but loving father in the first movie, and in the second, it's almost like he's lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects. scuttle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his 'dingle-hopper' (yes, i'll admit it; i did call my fork a dingle-hopper from time to time after that). in this film, scuttle's all but forgotten. a supporting character even in the first, he at least added something to the movie. he was rich with a flavor the others didn't have, and in the sequel, they all but stripped it from him entirely. sebastian was still the same, but twice as worrisome as before. disney, don't do that. don't even try to mess with our favorite crab. or our favorite little fat fish, who becomes a dad and has a multitude of very annoying children. he's fat, and he's bland, and he looks like he's going to flat line any second.<br /><br />the walrus and penguin were unneeded, and after a while, you just start to resent everyone. especially melody, who has no depth to her whatsoever.<br /><br />and one of these days, disney, i'm kicking out of my life.<br /><br />if i didn't love your originals so much.
