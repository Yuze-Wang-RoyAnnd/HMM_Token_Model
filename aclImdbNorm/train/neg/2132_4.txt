this film tried to be too many things all at once: stinging political satire, hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values promo... the list goes on and on. it failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end.<br /><br />although i appreciate the spirit behind war, inc., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique, rather than simply the poor writing, direction, and production of this particular film.<br /><br />there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war. but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. reminds me a bit of three kings, which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern.
