star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />long time inmate twitch (kurupt) gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re-opened alcatraz. he claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose. there he crosses paths with burke (bill goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same. but there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at burke. but the sh!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, cortez (robert madrid) takes twitch's girlfriend and burke's daughter hostage.<br /><br />steven seagal doesn't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of under siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie) so despite this being a dvd sequel, the lead role this time round goes to bill golberg (steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end.) but there's a reason he hasn't done much work since universal soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor, and not much of an action star either, managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one-liners. support wise, veterans from the first film, kurupt and tony plana, have merely jumped at the chance of extra work.<br /><br />this is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with the dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it. it does this quite well, unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along. **
