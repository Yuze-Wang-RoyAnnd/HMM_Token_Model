i couldn't believe my eyes when i watched nuremberg yesterday on dutch television. it starts very slowly, the backgrounds of the nuremberg trials become clear step by step, the germans have a funny english accent, but then, suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, the audience gets to see the most shocking, horrific footage i have ever seen.<br /><br />it is important that people get to see such footage (although i absolutely don't agree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this kind of material), but in this film it was completely ridiculous. it was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary tv series. it was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and unbelievably easy. in stead of trying to move us with well-done scenes, inspiring dialogue or interesting viewpoint's, the audience is being tortured with horrible images of skin-and-bones camp inmates. it doesn't show any respect for the victims of the holocaust.<br /><br />i'm very angry.
