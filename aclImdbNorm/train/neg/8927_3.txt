myron breckinridge (rex reed!!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (john carradine--dead drunk) and comes out as myra (raquel welch). she then decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and proceeds to teach film history at an acting college run by lecherous john huston (don't ask) and break up a young happy couple (young, handsome, hunky roger herren and farrah fawcett--yes the farrah fawcett). <br /><br />they took a great novel by gore vidal that was unfilmable and, naturally, tried to film it. they also hired an english guy with a decidedly anti-american attitude and hired a bunch of actors with questionable "talent" (welch, reed) and embarassed old professionals (huston, carradine, andy devine, jim backus, mae west), threw it all together and....surprise!!! an absolute disaster. <br /><br />the film got an x rating at its release (it's been lowered to an r), mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which welch sodomizes rusty (roger herren) and a scene in which welch attempts to have sex with fawcett.<br /><br />the movie is very scattershot...scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense. it's not good at all but i was never bored. <br /><br />acting varies wildly...reed is horrible...really sad. huston chews the scenery again and again and again to a nauseating extreme. welch is actually not bad as myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her. west is hardly in the movie (a blessing) and it's really kind of sick to hear a woman almost 80 years old cracking sex jokes. roger herren (whatever happened to...) was very young, handsome and not bad as rusty. fawcett is ok.<br /><br />it's hard to find things to say about this...you just watch it in disbelief. a must see movie--to believe!!!!
