this was so lame that i turned the dvd off...maybe halfway through. it was so weak, i couldn't even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in i made it.though i really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young carlito would be somewhat different, i just couldn't buy it. i don't really blame the actors, because i think it was the script that may have fallen flat. i did find myself laughing a few times, but i don't think those lines were intended to be funny.<br /><br />it's only saving grace is that i bought it in a 2 dvd set and i would have paid the price i did for the original alone. this is one of those cases when they should have let the classic stand alone.
