some wonder why there weren't anymore mrs. murphy movies after this one. will it's because this movie totally blew snot. disney was not the right studio to run this film. maybe touchstone (well, they're owned by disney, but it'd be more adult). the film is too kid-ish, as the book series is not. the casting is all wrong for the characters. the characters don't even act the way they do in the books. and why was tucker changed to a guy? he's a girl in the frigging books! was this done to make the film appeal to boys? sheesh. and where was pewter, the gray cat? one of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. rita mae brown is a good writer, but letting disney blow her work was wrong. an animated feature film, perhaps in the vane of don bluth's artwork would suit a better mrs. murphy film. overall, i give this a 2, because at least disney made a film from an under-appreciated book series. but, i wish they did better. either way, i still have my books to entertain me.
