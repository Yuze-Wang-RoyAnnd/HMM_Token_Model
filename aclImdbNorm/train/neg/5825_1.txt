this has got to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen! there were people leaving the theatre, others were falling asleep (ok, it was a late night show)... this is a no-sense movie, one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again. i would love to watch the making-off of this movie as i am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage. do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they're doing something interesting? i wonder... the soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous bjork album. even if you're a fan of bjork's music, stay home. it's the best thing to do. the little, tiny, pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture. god!...
