i'll say one thing for jeanette and nelson--even when stranded in a mirthless, witless, painfully inept musical like this, there's still that twinkle in their eyes. yes, the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin. even when the score is practically a throwaway, non-existent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes. and even when the circumstances are so unbelievable--yes, even for a fantasy.<br /><br />truth to tell, she has more chemistry with nelson than with her own real-life husband gene raymond in smilin' through, which, nonetheless, was a considerably better film.<br /><br />sorry, i love jeanette and nelson as much as the next fan, but this is the bottom of the heap. jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one "hep" number with binnie barnes--and nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situations.<br /><br />one can only wonder what this was like on broadway in 1938. surely, it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak mgm production. edward everett horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess. it's like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals sprinkled among the supporting cast.<br /><br />summing up: painfully clumsy rendering of a rodgers and hart musical. can't recommend it, even for fans of macdonald and eddy. and even if jeanette's close-ups still glow with her gossamer beauty, this film is jaw-droppingly bad.
