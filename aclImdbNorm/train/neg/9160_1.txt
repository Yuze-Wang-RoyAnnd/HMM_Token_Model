this movie was laughably bad. a friend rented it from netflix and made me watch it. there are so many gaffes and goofs that it's impossible to even bother getting to know the characters and the plot. how about these for example...<br /><br />the "vermont airport" surrounded by palm trees<br /><br />ben's miraculously appearing shirt during a phone conversation<br /><br />the priest's palatial office... complete with a folding card table desk<br /><br />there is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. but even if you look past the technical flaws, you'll find horrid acting and casting. i was most tickled by the casting of a flamboyantly gay actor to play the right-wing religious zealot brother. his opening scene, sitting in his immaculate apartment, stroking his kitty cat, was hilarious.<br /><br />i applaud the writer/director/producer/editor/star/caterer/cast dentist/composer (and whatever else he did on this move) for actually getting a movie like this distributed. if you have nothing better to do, it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game but don't rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.
