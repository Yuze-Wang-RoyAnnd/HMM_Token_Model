no matter how you look at this movie, it is just awful.<br /><br />if you view it as a horror, then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets.<br /><br />if you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame.<br /><br />if it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a b**ch!<br /><br />if you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero.<br /><br />as you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining. as mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a gremlins type movie. this however has the worst looking monsters of that genre. critters looked pretty good, so did the ghoulies, heck even the puppets from the munchies looked better than these. the characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable. the hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. at one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes...this movie is just utterly stupid. i like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum (which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21. give me a break, i am 25 and i look younger than any of them.
