really. does any week go by that oprah doesn't remind us that she was abused as child?<br /><br />she makes herself the focus of every interview.<br /><br />oprah cannot resist commenting on the answer to every question she asks. she often interrupts guests before an answer is finished to interject her own aside or anecdote. directors are obviously instructed to focus on her closeup reaction rather than guest's faces because that's what counts - what oprah feels, what oprah says.<br /><br />oprah, oprah, oprah. it's always all about oprah.<br /><br />oprah says - feel sorry for me, i was so poor. feel the pain of my battle with my weight. feel my hurt when i'm turned away from a fancy store after they've already closed. feel good for buying my magazines and books. feel good for my success. feel good when you give to my charity to make me look good. feel good for making me rich beyond belief.<br /><br />my interpretation of her point of view: you viewers are all deeply flawed and you need my daily advice. i have all the answers for your life though i have nothing in common with you plebes. i have never been married nor do i want to be. i have never had to raise a family - but i know all about it. i have little respect for men or marriage. i clearly prefer people like me over others - witness "legends ball 2006". gayle is my best friend but we are not gay.<br /><br />as of 7/31/2006, the heading on her website actually reads : "oprah.com is your leading source for information about love, life, self, relationships, food, home, spirit and health." how presumptive and obnoxious is that ? <br /><br />in june 2006, she crashed two private wedding receptions in oklahoma to gather footage for her september 2006 shows. she keeps promising to quit tv but her yapfest drags on with no end in sight.<br /><br />contrary to what she thinks, oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor on a personal mission from god. she's just one very lucky, overweight, black woman who copied phil donahue's style and called it her own. she happened to be in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck up to the right demographic. <br /><br />oprah is the p.t. barnum of this age and it amazes me that people cannot see through her facade. <br /><br />so ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you too oprah if you can fit that inflated ego through the door - this way now to the great egress ...
