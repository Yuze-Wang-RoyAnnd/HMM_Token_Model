i mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car? so what if their ten, it's way too immature for a little kid to sing about "being my women" i mean seriously! the name is pretty corny too, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants??? how creative.i don't get why they need a tv show i mean most artist don't really need a tv show about themselves, especially the naked brothers band. heck how many of them are in the freaking group. and seriously whats with the movie? jeez nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously the naked brother band? so many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the naked brother's band, its a stupid, uncreative show that should not be aired onto tv.
