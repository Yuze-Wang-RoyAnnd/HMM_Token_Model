ok, the movie is good but i give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale. this kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. first of all, strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus. an organic virus is much more complex, even though it's way tinier. though, it's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the rna, then change your own rna code. explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor? maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses? i could see that, but obviously, the writer didn't think of that.
