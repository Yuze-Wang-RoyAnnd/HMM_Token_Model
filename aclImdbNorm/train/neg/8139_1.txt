or maybe that's what it feels like. anyway, "the bat people" is about as flat as a rug, bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock...and as intelligent as all three combined.<br /><br />okay, plot in a nutshell (fitting vessel, that...): a doctor (moss) gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife (mcandrew) and subsequently turns into a bat - well, not exactly a bat but a bat-like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first-person camera viewpoint....<br /><br />but then there's the business of the sheriff (pataki), who is about the worst kind of sheriff: the hick kind. he hassles people, he leers at married women, he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries (the fiend!), he smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time, making him look and sound like buford t. justice in "smokey and the bandit" and (this is the worst part)... he's the most likeable character in the whole film!<br /><br />the whole film, though, is just tv movie-of-the-week-like crapola (guano, in this case). it's an aip, for crying out loud! what did you expect, oscar caliber stuff?<br /><br />and what else can you say about a film that not even mst3k can save?<br /><br />how about...no stars for "the bat people", full version or mst3k version!<br /><br />by the way, if there's ever a sequel for this movie, i'm burying my tv.
