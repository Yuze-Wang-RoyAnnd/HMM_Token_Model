no? didn't think so! well, in that case all you have to do is stay far, far away from "do you wanna know a secret", as it's just the umpteenth pointless post-"scream" slasher with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. the plot is extremely ridiculous; the characters are insufferably dumb, the gore-factor is negligible and the whole thing is just plain boring! as you can derive from the title already, this film is mainly inspired by "i still know what you did last summer", as the events take place in a similar setting and the killer's motivations are equally stupid. why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like "ikwydls" is a complete mystery to me, anyway. at least that film could depend on the precious rack of jennifer love hewitt, whereas the girls in this junk are, apart from brainless, also terribly unattractive. one year after the still unsolved murder of her boyfriend, beth morgan, her new adulterous lover and four other simple-minded college students go to florida to spend their spring break holiday in a fancy beach house. the killer hasn't made a move all year, but now he follows the posse to florida and starts butchering them whilst leaving behind the titular message as some sort of business card. you really don't need to be a horror-expert in order to quickly figure out which face hides behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask and the writers' attempts to put you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing. since the plot is so thin, most of the film is purely irrelevant padding, including the sub plots regarding the incompetent floridian police force and the 'mysterious' fbi inspector who seems to have a personal score to settle. the murder inexplicably happen off screen (don't you hate it when that happens?), there isn't even any gratuitous t&a to enjoy and you better don't get me started on the quality of the dialogs. suffering through crap like this only makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the 80's slashers is gone for good.
