very, very humdrum movie fare here with stella stevens taking directions from someone in disguise(it didn't take me long to guess who it was) in old nevada town outside vegas for a money heist in the circus circus hotel in las vegas. stevens leads her girl gang of three, and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated. despite some neat looks at las vegas in the 70's, very average yet credible acting from most involved, and a plot line with potential, las vegas lady lays one big boring egg. it seems forever for the film to kick into gear,and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up. i was somewhat disappointed with this film. sure, i wasn't expecting anything great, but i at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70's or something like it. not even close. no one dies. there is a lame gunfight between creaky stuart whitman and officious george dicenzo, one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney bugliosa in helter skelter. the gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall. there is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument. beyond that nothing in terms of action. and as for the girls, don't expect much there either. stella and her girls(both very mediocre yet pretty talents, get in a sauna and a bath. what do we see? nothing but a fleeting side profile. stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents, but i wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance. that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film. alas, it was not to be, and i have little to say in this film's favor. it isn't a horrible film in any way, it just has nothing going for it either. yawn.
