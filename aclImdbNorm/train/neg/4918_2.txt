a wealthy harvard dude falls for a poor radcliffe chick much to the consternation of his strict father (ray milland).<br /><br />syrupy, sugary, and most of all, sappy story about a battle of the 'classes' when rich-kid ryan o'neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule. ali macgraw is the social derelict with the filthy mouth while john marley plays her devout-catholic father, but no one in the film is more annoying than o'neal himself with his whimpering portrayal as harvard's champion yuppie.<br /><br />followed 8(!) years later by 'oliver's story'.
