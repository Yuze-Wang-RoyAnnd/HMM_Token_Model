to quote the film, "it's better not to know. better still to forget. best of all to be abandoned." oh, the irony.<br /><br />a ghost story with all the technical refinements of a hollywood horror film, but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film, and you feel like you're being preached to from the start.<br /><br />it's as if the writers' cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop tv and a jerry springer show. fitting, maybe, for a film like the hitcher, not a russia-set horror film. the result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly, not scary or meaningful.
