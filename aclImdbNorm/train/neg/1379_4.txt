monika mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence. i wouldn't say blood-soaked; but there is insult and injury. max matteo(john cassini)is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen, but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after. there is always a producer's nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks. well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition...max becomes obsessed with such thoughts. the rewarding career is just a swing, push and shot away. other cast members: rene rivera, molly parker, jennifer beals, frank cassini and cameos by eric roberts and sandra oh. well, that's show business...or is it?
