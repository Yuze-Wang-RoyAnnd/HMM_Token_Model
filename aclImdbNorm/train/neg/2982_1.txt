zombie review #3<br /><br />**spoilers**<br /><br />few films are actually "so bad they're good", and zombi 3 is not just bad, it's wretchedly, unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them all<br /><br />more than that, it's a film credited to lucio fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency, sense or reason. however we can't blame fulci as it wasn't really directed by him but by bruno mattei, who doesn't even have fulci's sense of style to help carry the film. mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitude.<br /><br />so, i'm ashamed to say how much i enjoyed every worthless minute of zombi 3. it has no redeeming features - in a genre known for thin characters, weak story, and lack of film making skill, zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so it's even funnier than nightmare city.<br /><br />the "action" starts when the "death 1" gas is stolen from a military base, and damaged in the escape. who is the thief, why did he steal it, and why did the us military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea? all these questions and more will fail to be answered in zombi 3....<br /><br />after hiding out at a hotel, the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it, sending "death 1" up into the atmosphere resulting in... zombie birds! who then attack people and turn them into zombie people!!! (if zombies are cannibals, why don't the zombie birds just attack other birds?)<br /><br />then we meet our "heroes", a trio of horny gis and a coachload of girls. there's a couple of other guys with them too, but they're not important - no one is important here. you'll be hard pressed to remember anyone's face, let alone their name or find a reason to care about them. they end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief ("a week ago this place was buzzing with life, now it's buzzing with flies!") but there's no escape from the undead.<br /><br />by this point you'll either be completely sucked in or you'll have turned the damned thing off. the script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world couldn't save it, so it's just as well they have some of the worst - and not just the human characters, the zombie acting here is an all time low. there's no consistancy in how the zombies behave - some shamble about in the time honored style, others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes, not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk (a gimmick that gives the film it's horrifying twist ending). they die from gunshots to the chest (rather than the head) and even get knocked out by a good left-hook. how can you punch out a zombie???!!!!! in fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of v...<br /><br />the zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life. they hide in bushes, in garages, in huts, on roofs, in the water, and even underneath pregnant women. at one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. to kill and eat her? no! to push her into the water, those zombies and their wacky sense of humour!<br /><br />there is plenty of gore though. limbs are hacked, wounds ooze green pus, and there's much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in. there's nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing, but if bad make up effects are your bag you won't be let down.<br /><br />all this and i've not even mentioned the awful music, the inexplicable flying zombie head, the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as really bad, or the final chilling punchline.... in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being overrun by zombies, zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie dj!! "he's gone over to their side!" our escaping hero's cry, before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never came.<br /><br />zombi 3 is rubbish - it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of it's existence erased, yet somehow i feel my life is richer for having seen it.<br /><br />did i say richer? i meant 88 minutes shorter...
