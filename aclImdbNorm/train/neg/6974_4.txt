blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense. at one point,some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels, exploring. <br /><br />they begin to discuss what they'll find down there and one of them (a girl) says she bets they'll find a blue monkey.<br /><br />yes, thats it. totally inconsequential to the story, the only sad connection to the title, and no idea why she would suppose she'd find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement.<br /><br />i'm embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember i suppose!
