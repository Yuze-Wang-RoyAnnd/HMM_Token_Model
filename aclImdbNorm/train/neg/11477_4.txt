sorry my fellow nevada city neighbors, but this one is bad.<br /><br />brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie.<br /><br />alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside. she was stiff throughout the movie.<br /><br />i looked up both alice and brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work. i would have guessed that they were first-year students.<br /><br />ed asner and peter jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line. ed certainly has not lost his charisma. i wish i'd taken the time to meet him while he was here.<br /><br />i love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because i've been there. i make nevada city my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere. i was sadly disappointed.<br /><br />sorry.
