i don't know what some of you are smoking, but i suspect it's potent.<br /><br />to call swept away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness. the acting is hideous and i'm not picking on madonna here, we all know she's useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious. my back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines. the editing is so sloppy, it beggars description. the photography and composition (which in this era, competence should be a given for any film with a budget) are astonishingly inept, even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking. these are basic elements of filmmaking, if you can't get them right, you should seek another line of work. it's as contrived as a grade 3 production of snow white, except nowhere near as well made or interesting.<br /><br />the original film by lina wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly acted and written, featuring breathtaking visuals - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair. the sexual tension feels real and immediate...those of you who found guy ritchie's version deplorable, should see it, it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema.<br /><br />those of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined.
