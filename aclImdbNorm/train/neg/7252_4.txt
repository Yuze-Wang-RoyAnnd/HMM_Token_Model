the decoy is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newcomers, but it doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most such films. it has a definite story, it has adequate acting, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men, and the background music isn't overdone. this is a dvd new release, so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile. i don't know where all the 10's come from, as there's no way this film is that good --- even if you're the filmmaker's mother. <br /><br />the last film we saw at a theater was warner's trashing of j k rawlings much-loved and excellent book, order of the phoenix. in comparing the decoy with phoenix, consider that phoenix (as made by warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. i rated phoenix a "1" because the scale doesn't go any lower. the decoy is 4 times better -- in all regards.<br /><br />if you have the opportunity, give the decoy a chance. remember, this isn't "decoy 3 -- the shootout" or any such nonsense. it's original. if your expectations aren't overblown by the foolish "10" scores here, you might just enjoy the film on its own terms.
