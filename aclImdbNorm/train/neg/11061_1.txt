curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". unfortunately, i didn't rent it, i bought it! the most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing. for reasons known only to them, the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer. are you kidding me? the man gave new meaning to the term "finger lickin' good"! and with all the flash-backs and flash-forwards i had trouble following the story. all in all jeremy renner's performance wasn't too bad. you can catch him in "s.w.a.t.", in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop. anyway, i would rate this as a 1/10. it only got a 1 because of renner's so-so performance. there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer's crimes. avoid this one.
