munchies starts in deepest darkest peru (looks more like a dirt road to me) where archaeologist simon watterman (harvey korman) & his son paul (charles stratton) are on an expedition. simon thinks that ancient aztec buildings were in fact spacecraft control centres & he is on a mission to gain proof that alien lifeforms have visited earth, while in once such structure he discovers a strange small creature which he sticks in his backpack & takes back home with him to the small american town of sweetwater in california. simon feels that the creature is the proof he has been looking for & for some inexplicable reason decides to leave the thing at home while he goes to share his discovery. simon ask's paul & his wife cindy (nadine van der velde) to take care of it. meanwhile simon's brother & fast-food businessman cecil watterman (harvey korman again) steals the creature so his brother won't make any money out of it, but his idiotic stepson dude (jon stafford) has a fight with it & chops it up with a knife but the individual parts grow back into separate little creatures that proceed to cause much havoc amongst the townspeople...<br /><br />directed by bettina hirsch this has to be one of the worst horror comedy's ever, if not the worst. the script by lance smith is so unfunny it's painful. every joke in munchies misses the target by the proverbial mile, i doubt the humour in this piece of crap would even appeal to pre-teens. there just isn't anything even remotely funny or even amusing in munchies as far as i'm concerned. the basic story is crap too, they just happen to find this creature running around with no explanation of what it is, why no-ones ever seen it before, how it manages to learn english so quickly & how it learns to drive etc. the whole thing is a big gremlins (1984) rip-off with none of the elements that made that film so good. the character's are moronic, the stupid deputy (charlie phillips) & his dad (hardy rawls), cecil wearing an embarrassing wig & fake moustache & his air head wife melvis (alix elias) & more besides. they just plain embarrass & are ridiculous, i defy anyone to find any of this rancid rubbish funny. basically munchies fails spectacularly at being either a comedy or horror & ends up being, yes you've guessed it, crap.<br /><br />director hirsch was obviously working with a low budget here & it shows, the entire thing takes place in two houses, the desert, some caves & a miniature golf course. this is really cheap & incompetent film-making. the special effects on the munchies themselves are really awful, their just dolls that have no movement unless someone off camera pulls a string attached to it's arm. i cannot stress how bad the effects are, these things wouldn't convince my 4 year old nephew (as proved by me & him yesterday!). total incompetence all the way, this film sucks.<br /><br />technically the film is terrible, bad special effects, lame production design, rubbish sets & well, just everything's crap. the acting is rotten through & through, from the cops to korman who has two roles both of which prove he can't act & isn't funny.<br /><br />munchies is a really bad film that fails in everything that it tries to achieve, sure watch it if you want i won't stop you but just don't say you weren't warned! my advice would be to watch gremlins again instead, but the decision is yours!
