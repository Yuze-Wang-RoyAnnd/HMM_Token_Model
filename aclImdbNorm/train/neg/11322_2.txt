there is a word for this sort of film, and that word is "drivel." it was drivel when it was a vhs rental, and it's drivel on satellite re-runs now.<br /><br />it might fool you, because it has 2 moderately well-known names in kistofferson and henriksen, reasonable soundtrack music, and nice monument valley scenery.<br /><br />it also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot.<br /><br />if that's all you want from a movie, then maybe this will keep you happy.<br /><br />it's still drivel, though.
