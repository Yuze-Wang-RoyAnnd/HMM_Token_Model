please, spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified. couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a farrelly or a coen brother, plus the lives of yet another group of supposedly high school age people acting out their dawson creek-brand teen angst complete with a genxyz soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie "feel" cool and, we have intensely and painfully inept satire.<br /><br />this isn't even watered-down 'ferris bueller'...i'd rather watch a traffic light change.<br /><br />only one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission: when the betty masked girls meet a richard nixon masked friend. it's a surreal moment. priceless even.<br /><br />but for the rest of it, i'd rather have a toothache. at least i can apply some benzocaine(tm) to stop the pain.
