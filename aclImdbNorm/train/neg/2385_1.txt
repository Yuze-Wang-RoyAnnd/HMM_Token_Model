i watched this film because i'm a big fan of river phoenix and joaquin phoenix. i thought i would give their sister a try, rain phoenix. i regret checking it out. she was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it. sissy was just weird and jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? i have never been so unsatisfied in my life. it was just total rubbish. i can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. have sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me. i thought she was everything but that. those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? whats the point??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll doesnt have a 0, doesnt even deserve a 1. hopefully, rain is better in other films, i forgive her for this one performance, i mean i wouldnt do much better with that film.
