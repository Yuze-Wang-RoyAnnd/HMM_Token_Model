throw this lame dog a bone. sooo bad...you may watch anyway. kol(ross hagen)is an intergalactic bad guy that escapes being vaporised by an over zealous spaceship commander(jan-michael vincent). kol manages to steal a shuttle that crash lands on earth. an unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the villain dead or alive. john phillip law plays a forest/park ranger that urges caution in dealing with these two visitors from far, far away. costumes are outrageous and the script is lacking intelligence. vincent surely took the money and ran. law shows the only sign of effort.so bad it is almost comical. also in the cast: dyana ortelli, p.j. soles and dawn wildsmith.
