because that's all she does through out this whole movie,is get naked for no good reason.when tarzan is bitten by a snake,she suddenly removes her clothes.since when is a boa constrictor poisonous?how did tarzan get poisoned by the way ? this whole movie is screwed up.they couldn't get the species of animals for this movie right.whats an orangutang doing hanging around those chimpanzees?he must have wandered off the set of a much better film.the group of cannibal tribe's men look caucasin.why?and why was bo and her dad painted,if they were going to be eaten later?it was probably just a lame excuse to show her breasts and curves again.her dad while hunting, approaches and acts stupidly around a bull elephant while standing too close to it.any real african bull elephant that wasn't from the circus,would've stomped this moron's butt.any smart hunter would've started shooting the minute he saw it.and i can't help but wonder if the camera was on lsd,because it kept showing various scenes that went in slow motion, for no good reason.it didn't make good sense at all.the boa constrictor that tarzan wrestled with in the water,looks like one of those 12 ft rubber snakes you can buy at a local spencer gifts.tarzan was strangly speechless in this film,maybe from bo flashing herself so much.i'm sorry,but this is a rip off of a classic black and white tarzan movie,with a similar but better story.not to mention plotting .there's one scene in that i saw that everyone forgot to mention.*(spoilers alert)*the scene where he is trying to rescue jane and her dad,has him standing too close to a running water spout.it made it seem like he's urinating on someone below him.eww!also, him and jane are fooling around on a beach,with perverted monkeys jumping and clapping.she sure did take her dad's death real well.*(end of spoilers)*there should be a surgeon general's warning on this film.that seeing bo naked too much in this movie,will make you go blind.
