to be honest, i didn't watch all of the original 'howling', but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie. so great, that seven horrible sequels had to be made. they started off with "howling ii: your sister is a werewolf". i got this movie on vhs from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when atari was brand new. i just watched it last night, and it wasn't really bad, it was just weird. i mean, the whole thing with sybil danning going three-way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing (but kinda hot), christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she's a vampire, etc. actually, this movie was actually like some sort of mish-mash of dracula and the lost boys...except with werewolves, because everything christopher lee (whom played dracula himself) was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie (stake in the heart, garlic, the creature of the night must die at night, and the ruler of werewolves lives in transylvania). not much for the acting, but the worst of it came from annie mcenroe. i swear, at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out, because that damn throat always had to say something. anyway, the plot is pretty silly and clich'ed, so there's no real point in telling you, you could just read about it on wikipedia. by the way, the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it's the only film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original (not counting howling iv (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so don't see this movie. there's no real horror, hardly any werewolves, and just horrible special fx. 3/10
