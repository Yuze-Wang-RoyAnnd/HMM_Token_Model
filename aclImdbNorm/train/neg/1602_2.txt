anyone who thinks this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius must have been smoking with the two stoners in the film. this film is not under-rated...it is a bad movie. <br /><br />there should be no comparisons between this film and the naked gun or airplane since the latter two films are well written and funny. class reunion is neither of those things. the sad thing is it had such potential (good cast, good story lines) but the good jokes are few and far between. the scenes that were supposed to be funny came off more annoying than amusing. the stoner guys, the vampire, the blind girl...not funny. the only funny character were delores (the one who sold her soul to the devil).<br /><br />national lampoon has made some really good films (animal house, vacation) but this isn't one of them. i certainly expected more from john hughes.
