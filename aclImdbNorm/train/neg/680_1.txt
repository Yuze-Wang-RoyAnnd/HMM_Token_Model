i finally caught up to "starlight" last night on television and all i can say is. . . wow! it's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects (check out the laser beams shooting out of willie's eyes!), the atrocious acting, the ponderous dialogue, the mismatched use of stock footage, or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production. this truly is a one-of-a-kind experience, and we should all be thankful for that. i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood!
