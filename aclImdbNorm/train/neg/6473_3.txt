as a child the first installment ("the little mermaid") was my favorite movie. it was filled with great characters, songs, and a fun family film. a week or so again i watched this movie for the first time. i believe that this movie was like most sequels and didn't surpass their original. i think that i feel this way possibly because i had high expectations and i have grown up. however, it is not a bad film.<br /><br />it starts when ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, melody. eric and ariel feel threatened by morgana (eurselas' sister), so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea. as melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go. trouble stirs up as morgana tries to take control of the seven seas.<br /><br />i don't want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out. i did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing. i think this is a good family film though overall!
