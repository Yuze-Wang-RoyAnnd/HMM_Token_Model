watching this movie made me think constantly; why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes? there are a million options to slow down the car! in the movie speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop...<br /><br />there aren't many good things to say about this film; all the usual narrative cliche's make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is as leak as a sieve etc. that makes this movie a waste of time and money.<br /><br />
