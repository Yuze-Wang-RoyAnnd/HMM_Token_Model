swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate american hardened action movies like "heat" but with a low budget. this movie follows the same prescription as "noll tolerans" and "livvakterna". however, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough movie.<br /><br />the story has been seen before, the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor, especially from the main actress. the movie tries to paint a picture of hard-boiled military-like robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational. it does not succeed very well.<br /><br />the bluish-cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore, and it is not even done well in this picture. only a very few scenes actually look good. also, the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterward.<br /><br />the main quality of this movie is stefan sauk, though not making a convincing portrait of a swat-team leader, has some really funny lines. also, the music is quite well.
