the ballad of django is a meandering mess of a movie! this spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other (and much better!) films supposedly tied together by "django" telling how he brought in different outlaws. hunt powers (john cameron) brings nothing to the role of django. skip this one unless you just have to have every django movie made and even that may not be a good enough excuse to see this one!!
