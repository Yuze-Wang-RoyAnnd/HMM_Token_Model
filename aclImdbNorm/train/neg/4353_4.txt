the class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27-year-old former class mates.<br /><br />i like the idea of the show. that's why it saddens me that the class is not funny, even though it has the obvious potential. it's not enough corky, just dorky. (haha.) this is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines. also some actors have difficulties with timing.<br /><br />most inventively written characters are the twins kat and lina warbler (lizzy caplan and heather goldenhersh) but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show. on the other hand the characters i find most uninteresting are the main character ethan and the used-to-be- couple duncan and nicole.<br /><br />what bothers me with the series is that the only latino character aaron is being picked on for his accent (even though by a non-respectable character, but anyway).
