way back when, the x-files was an intelligent, thought-provoking show. a big part of its appeal was that the writers looked to folklore and science for their ideas, tying the plot to the spooky side of real life.<br /><br />i was incredibly wary of the 8th season when it aired. the show had already provided two perfectly good episodes to bow out on ("one son" and "requiem"), and the 7th season had seen a sharp rise in episodes that scraped the barrel for ideas that were far-fetched, implausible, or downright silly. but i figured, hey, give it the benefit of a doubt, maybe they're bringing it back because they've got some great ideas lined up.<br /><br />"roadrunners" really was upsetting. following "patience", which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire folklore that the show had done well to avoid, the episode sees a strange (alien?) parasitic slug with the power of mind control worshipped by a cult of backwoods christians. oh, and they think it's the second coming of christ, but you only find that out in the last couple of minutes. seriously. there's never *any* attempt to make sense of this, to explain what the slug is, why anything that's happening is happening, or anything. even in the show's early years - in fact, *especially* then - you could expect a little bit more depth, a bit of background, or if not that then the opposite - a bit of mystery, some uncertainty about what this was all about. <br /><br />it's scully that really kills it though. you could put up with the silliness of the premise, but to have a character who has been developed over a good 7 years as a rational skeptic transformed into a gullible maverick purely for the sake of advancing the plot is bizarre to watch. you feel like you're watching some godawful teen horror, except that it's a woman well into her thirties throwing herself into the kind of creepy isolated community that she's spent the best part of a decade uncovering the sinister underbelly of, being either outwitted by very stereotypical hicks or utterly indifferent to her own safety. oh, and by the way, doggett, the new mudler, isn't around. scully just wandered off into the desert to look into a brutal murder on her own without him. he shows up at the end to save the day - i can't even remember why - but apart from that, he's not really in it. again: seriously.<br /><br />in short, it feels like either a generic script written for another show, or someone's pet movie project which they've been allowed to shove like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing, long-running show at a time when it was at its most vulnerable. it might've worked on a lesser show, where the characters are more archetypal and the audience expects less. but the x-files had a good thing going, and scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic tv characters of the 90s. deciding that you're going to change her personality for the sake of a story that they must've done on star trek a good fifty or so times is pointless.
