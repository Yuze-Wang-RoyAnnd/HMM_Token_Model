i have seen poor movies in my time, but this really takes the biscuit! why oh why has this film been made? there just is nothing here whatsoever. please put your trust in me, flick the off switch and destroy your copy of this film. there is a plot... that could take about 5 minutes to show on camera. this is the key problem, the story 'based on a true story' (mmm... whatever) just in no way lends itself to be padded out for 80 minutes. and so we therefore have to sit through over an hour of watching people walk around. that is it! in the whole first half an hour absolutely nothing happens, apart from watching someone walk to a shop... and then 3 guys walking through a wood. this time could perhaps have been spent on developing character... but no. and so there is absolutely no connection to the people on screen, and so when they start to get shot, we couldn't care less! in fact i was in the end vouching for the baddie so that the film would end! on top of this the camera work is truly horrific! this director/editor/writer/producer, ti west is rubbish. i hate to hit a guy, but really, his work is pants! these dull close ups continuously, and then long single takes following people as they walk - i'm sure he thinks he's clever, but the results are so dull i just wanted to stop the film and slit my wrists! how this man has been brought on to direct the next cabin fever movie is beyond me! to finish, the acting is also woeful,... which goes for the film as a whole. preserve your sanity, stick clear of this heap of total excrement!
