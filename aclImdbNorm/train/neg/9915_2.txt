i just finished "dark chamber" aka "under surveillance" and i'm stunned. stunned, not by the film, but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it. the story was so ravaged by plot-holes and the majority of the acting so flat, categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate. seriously, i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this movie.<br /><br />justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer-addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite mom's warnings that dad is no good. when a young woman is found murdered, justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments. with the help of a couple pals, he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks. as the truth begins to unravel, justin uncovers an unexpected secret.<br /><br />one positive point is that felissa rose is hot! i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit, but no such luck. it would have been the film's potential saving grace. eric conley played justin very adeptly, i thought, and i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future. <br /><br />the general premise of the film, although plagued by clich'es, might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow "performances" of key cast members, most notably alexandra eitel (kayla) and david h. rigg (justin's father). the horror! (pardon the pun).<br /><br />i have nothing against low-budget films. indeed, i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come. i'll cut low-budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical score and the overall picture quality. i don't give allowances, however, for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover's script. there are a vast number of competently-made low budget films out there. sadly, this isn't one of them. i can't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised "dark chamber" here are in some way affiliated with its production.
