what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel. i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original. this version is no different. i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever...anyway back to this version. it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style. it succeeds in both but high art it is nit. throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe...the direction was average and the editing abysmal. worse than the old quincy. deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents. the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project. although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had. its clear that he was a director for hire and didn't instill the project with the passion that it deserved.
