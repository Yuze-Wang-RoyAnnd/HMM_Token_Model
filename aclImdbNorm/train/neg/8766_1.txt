i should put out an alert all over saying that the movie shouldn't be watched. it fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. the special effect were horrible, i hadn't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology. how can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1/10th the speed? how can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? how can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away? how come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself?<br /><br />not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me, it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder. there were the standard dialogues like ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to hindustaan me hai and loc cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. stupid to say the least.<br /><br />what shobha de had written is true. the director worked without a script and it shows. there is no flow to the movie. there is no gradual progression from one battle to another. it is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war. the explanatory scenes are awful. the chief of army staff looks unconvincing. to make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours.
