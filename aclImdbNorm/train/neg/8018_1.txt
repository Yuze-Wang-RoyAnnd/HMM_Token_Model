wow, i hated this movie. the subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film, and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic, but the script - if there even *was* a script - is a mess. this is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere. i'd say it goes nowhere fast, except that it's actually the longest 81 minutes you'll ever sit through. as i've mentioned, the lead actor is good. so is faruza baulk (sp?), as his sometimes-harsh-but-ultimately-loving-and-accepting mother. the film makers have a lot to answer for here, because this is a mess. a real shame,because i really wanted to like this movie, but it's basically out-takes from a movie that never got made. skip this one - it wasn't even worth the $6 i shelled out for pay-per-view.
