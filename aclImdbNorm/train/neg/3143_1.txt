the tragedy of the doomed ship titanic has inspired many books and movies. the battle between nature and technology always caught man's imagination. the latest film concerning this tragedy in the atlantic ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker james cameron. the story of "titanic" involves two fictional characters (leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet) from different backgrounds (one is a hobo-artist, the other is an aristocrat) and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on.<br /><br />first of all, although using a historical name, this movie had little regard to history. the plot was built around two fictional lovers, french diamond, and treasure hunters. the deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background. many historical facts were simply forgotten. where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings? why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal? omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy. and what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is.<br /><br />the overall plot was rather shallow; rich equals greed and corruption, poverty equals compassion and heroism. it is very ironic to spend $200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts. there was absolutely no human side shown in anti-heroes. it seemed like billy zane was playing a part of the devil. casting was also very poor. if dicaprio was 2 inches shorter than winslet, you could swear she was his baby-sitter. the length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours. first hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse. hearing corny pick up lines such as "i see you" and "this is my side of the ship" generated more pain than the screams of drowning people. also, jokes were too abundant and rather lame.<br /><br />"titanic" did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original. the best thing about this film were its special effects, and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award.<br /><br />although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense, the public could not resist a sentimental story starring romeo (dicaprio), and so the movie became a success. now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture, so it seems that "titanic" did achieve something after all.
