not that i tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed, but when i put a dvd in expecting a bloodbath, and what i get is one bloody scene (the eyeball) at the tail end of asinine fake slapping, and spinning in a desk chair, i end up thinking "well that's 43 minutes of my life gone forever." i wouldn't considers this or flower of flesh and blood "movies" so much as an exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. flower of flesh and blood had a few tough spots to watch. the devil's experiment did not. it was at best, stupid, and at worst...well...really stupid. perhaps my expectation were too high. i put the dvd thinking "oh man, this is gonna be sick." after watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times, i was watching it in fast forward.<br /><br />two kinds of people would be interested in this film. 1) people who seek out f'd up films just to see how f'd up it really is, or 2) horror completest. i sought this and the other guinea pig films for the latter reason, but even if i fell into the category of the former, this film wouldn't float my boat. as a matter of fact, i could imagine this film increasing one's blood lust...as in "would you just kill the b*tch already!!" so in conclusion, the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes. if you want carnage that traditional horror doesn't provide, get traces of death. sure, that sucks too, but at least you'll get the blood and guts you expect.<br /><br />the only reason i can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they're supposed to. no artistic merit that i can comprehend, no reason for it's notoriety, no nothing. just a lame attempt to be shocking.
