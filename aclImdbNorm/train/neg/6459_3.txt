such great actors such a disappointment. marlon brando plays and awful character, the movie is not funny at all, a subconscious message can be seen "it is a damn crap!!!", "it suucks so badly!!", "throw your tv through window", and so on. it is simply disgusting and irksome. in addition to foolish plot, sense of humor, there is something else. the way the rooms are decorated, the colors. it makes me sick, everything is so colourful that it might cause epilepsy. usually i do not care about the decoration in movie but this from "free money" made me angry. avoid at all costs! "free money" - probably for charlie sheen, sutherland and brando, but a viewer gets nothing! one watches it at cost of sanity.
