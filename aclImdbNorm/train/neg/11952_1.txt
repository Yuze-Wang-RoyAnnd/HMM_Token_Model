his first movie after longtime friend john belushi's death, aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for belushi.<br /><br />instead, "doctor detroit" gives us bookish professor aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as mom. that's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a pimp's dinner (or something like that) to attend. no wonder aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time. why should the viewer be alone?<br /><br />it was on this film that aykroyd met future wife donna dixon. at least some good came out of this chaotic mess.<br /><br />one and a half stars. you want good aykroyd, see "the blues brothers". you want bad, see "doctor detroit".
