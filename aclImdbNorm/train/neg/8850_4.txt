now this film isn't going to scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big reason and a smaller one- well, that's three reasons, isn't it.<br /><br />the first reason this is interesting is the special effects. i found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular. to see the hair growing on marsha a. hunt and sybil danning was creepy, especially when they were participating in a m'enage `a trois.<br /><br />of interest, is the fact that this marsha hunt is the famous "brown sugar" of the rolling stones song, and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the london cast of the rock musical hair.<br /><br />besides the special effects, there were two other points of note in this film, and they were brought out repeatedly during the closing credits. i lost count, but i swear that sybil danning bared those points for us in the closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more. theyu were the most outstanding feature of the film.
