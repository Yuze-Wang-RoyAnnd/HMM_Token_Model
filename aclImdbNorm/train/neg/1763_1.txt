this is one of the worst movies ever made. trite. predictable. flat.<br /><br />the only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting barcelona. i imagine they would use films like this in guantanamo or some other hidden cia/nsa prison to torture suspects.<br /><br />often bad movies have some redeeming features, this has nothing. if i was in it or worked on it, i would change my name. truly a turd. hard to write more than this, but i feel the world's film watchers needed a head's up on this. on the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can't stand.<br /><br />you could send it to politicians you dislike, in laws, ex-wives, teachers you hated, former employees, dick cheney, w., and a host of others.
