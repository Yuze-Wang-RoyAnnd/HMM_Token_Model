ok, my girlfriend and i rented the dvd and about 30 minutes into the movie, we'd exchanged a lot of "ehhh, what is this movie about and more importantly, do i care to find out what it ends with" glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the "plot" or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else. we opted for the latter.<br /><br />i liked "but i'm a cheerleader" a lot, but mango kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste, sorry! i definitely prefer "d.e.b.s", "better than chocolate", "fucking amal", "goldfish memory" and "fire".<br /><br />-sorcia
