there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. first of all, let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. cat was... well, just awful.<br /><br />jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.<br /><br />why, why, why mike myers?? the kids could care less, and the austin powers demographic isn't going to spy this film. so, what was the studio thinking?<br /><br />the cat was also apparently related to linda richmond. can we talk? why a new york accent? not entirely consistent with anything dr. seuss has ever written. myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish shtick. i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said "as long as you don't say fahklempt', you can keep the accents." meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, either with the costume, make-up, or dialogue.<br /><br />the jokes, what few there were, were crude and age inappropriate. when myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera: "dirty ho", everything but the rim shot was missing, and even that wouldn't have helped.<br /><br />the same folks who created 'whoville', clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'cat'. the sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction, and myers.<br /><br />there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston. dakota fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr. seuss classic, and stayed true to the genre.<br /><br />call the spca. this cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again. please, please, no sequel.
