this movie sucked. the acting sucked, the script sucked, and the movie overall sucked. there were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening.<br /><br />i'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. examples:<br /><br />the heroine's negative comments about the hero. the audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. the viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well.<br /><br />also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. no explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them.<br /><br />we gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. it was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)
