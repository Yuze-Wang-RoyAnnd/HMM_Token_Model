i just blew four dollars renting this movie! why alliance atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me. but even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of canadian newspaper critics gave this film. i'm tired of our media justifying a film simply because it's canadian and low budget. it's like they expect canadian films to be lousy, so they give it a good review regardless.<br /><br />now about the movie: the acting was below average (with the exception of the lead male character, who was actually pretty good). the film quality was poor, which i guess could be expected from the extremely low budget. the script was absolutely horrendous. an example is the story, which revolves around one of the lead characters, a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang, whose only purpose is to randomly destroy suv's. supposedly many of her gang members' bicycles are destroyed in these activities (i don't know how she can't afford to just buy new ones, since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from vancouver to toronto).<br /><br />anyway, the point of the story (which isn't revealed until well over halfway through the movie) is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable - as no one will want to live in the area.<br /><br />- need i say more.<br /><br />shame on the toronto film festival for accepting such a film, telefilm for supporting it, and the globe and mail and georgia straight newspapers for giving such biased reviews.<br /><br />a film shouldn't get special treatment just because it's canadian!!!!
