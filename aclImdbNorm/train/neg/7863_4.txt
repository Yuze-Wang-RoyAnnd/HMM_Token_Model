thhe2 is entertaining in that you'll laugh a lot and cringe and probably say "oh sh*t!" and "get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumb**s" or things along those lines but i don't know if its really worth seeing- i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who don't seem to know the first thing about combat.<br /><br />yes there was more violence, gore, and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is (and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast). my time would have been better spent watching aja's remake for the 5th time.<br /><br />so go for some laughs, or go for some gore, but don't go hoping to come out of it satisfied.
