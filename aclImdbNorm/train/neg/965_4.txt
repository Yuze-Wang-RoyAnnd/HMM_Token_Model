first i liked that movie. it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments. the costume designer albert wolsky did his best!!! the same as wonderful set decorator robert r. benton - this man really had a very good taste!!! but the script writers disappointed me extremely. the best ending would be the scene on the ladder, but instead of it, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. don't like the ending. the father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright. it would be ok, if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they only deprived him of memories. the actors were good, they were really funny. cybill shepherd was charming, robert downey jr. was very funny in the dancing scene : )))... but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. for example, corinne jeffries, played by cybill shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!), she was true to him, she loved nobody but him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, after a scene with her friend philip train (ryan o'neal), she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years!!! it would be a good movie, if not the ending and some missed human psychology.
