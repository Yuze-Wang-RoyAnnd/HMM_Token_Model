be warned: neither zeta-jones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe. their roles are in fact minor.<br /><br />the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, with neither being really engaging. especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fianc'e. the plot drags terribly, and i turned this one off after about 2/3 - unusual for me, as i like to finish what i start. the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars.<br /><br />2/10
