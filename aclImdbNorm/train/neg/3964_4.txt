for all of the hype about this film, i kept an open mind as to what i would ultimately think. and, although a bit slow at times, the first 90% of the movie is quite good, with more than a few "old time" scares that make one jumpy and unsettled. i actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes. where dark remains fails, however, is in its climax. the ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be miles apart from its body. the storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and, the answer i was seeking most - what really happened to emma? - was not elucidated upon! the rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best, and in the end, i felt very cheated. what could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending.
