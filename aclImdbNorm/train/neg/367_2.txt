a young boy comes into a lot of money and promptly begins to live it up. unfortunately, the man whose money it really is happens to be very bad. he wants his loot back. when he discovers who has the bucks, he begins trying to get it back. he keeps getting foiled by this little kid who is just lucky enough to keep from falling into the evil man's hands. sounds familiar, i'll bet. very predictable, not interesting at all. come up with something a bit different, ok guys?
