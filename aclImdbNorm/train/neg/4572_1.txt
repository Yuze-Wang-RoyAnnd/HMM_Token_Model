this movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas, capped by such statements like "we all create our own reality".<br /><br />sorry, folks, reality is what true for all of us, not just the credulous.<br /><br />the idea that "anything's possible" doesn't hold water on closer examination: if anything's possible, contrary things are thus possible and so nothing's possible. this leads to postmodernistic nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal.<br /><br />to quote sci-fi writer philip k. dick, who put it so well, "reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."
