i am writing this review having watched it several months ago....the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie. it is a complete joke....and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like texas chainsaw massacre (1974) which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art. the producer who played brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers....hell he might not even be good at that either! the lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn't even see the actor's faces sometimes. i don't even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really, bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable. that's all the time i will waste on this review please stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents don't do it buy s piece of gum at least it would keep you entertained!<br /><br />if you want good quality low budget fun, far better than this... then check out a jeff hayes film....because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it!<br /><br />i gave this 1 star just for the cover art....thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called "film"<br /><br />-rick blalock
