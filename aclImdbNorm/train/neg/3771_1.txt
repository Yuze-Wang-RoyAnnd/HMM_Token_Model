this has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s. when my friends & i were watching this film (being the target audience it was aimed at) we just sat & watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was. the rest of the time, everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earnt working to watch this feeble excuse for a film. it must have looked like a great idea on paper, but on film it looks like no-one in the film has a clue what is going on. crap acting, crap costumes. i can't get across how embarrasing this is to watch. save yourself an hour & a bit of your life.........
