gregory peck's acting was excellent, as one would expect, and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic "moment." but, the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch, for me anyway. i tried to like it, but had to fast-forward through the last thirty minutes or so. i feel i wasted a couple of good hours. had it not been for gregory peck, i wouldn't have lasted fifteen minutes. 4/10.
