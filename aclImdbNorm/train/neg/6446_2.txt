the western society has been fed ideas about india being a poor country. movies like these only make those beliefs stronger. such illustrations make it all the more difficult for indians to be accepted abroad. agreed there are poor and homeless in india, but why is there no representation of educated people if not the successful ones.<br /><br />i totally hated the idea of the movie portraying patrick swayze as another mother teressa. in my opinion this movie has shown india in a very bad light giving wrong notions. it is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society. exactly the reason why people ask me, "when we go to india, can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads so full of filth and snakes?"<br /><br />those who want a second opinion on contemporary indian society should watch "monsoon wedding".
