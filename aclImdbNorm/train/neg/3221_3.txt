i watched this on the tube last night. the actor's involved first caught my attention. the first scenes were attention getters. some funny some sad. good character development. i felt that the latter third of the film diverged. if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching. i kept watching wanting to how how it tied together.<br /><br />unfortunately i feel that it never happened. i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish (?). was that the other shoe?<br /><br />would i recommend? no, i think not. as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated (60's jive) but it was not too distracting. the ending totally turned me off.
