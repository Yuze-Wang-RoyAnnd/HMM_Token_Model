it begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations.<br /><br />mac (akshay kumar) and sam's (john abraham) characters are not properly built before mac's boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess. rest of the drama is about how mac, sam and uncle mambo (paresh rawal) deal with situations which at times seem forced.<br /><br />about the cast, paresh rawal is a very talented actor, i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook. akshay kumar is tolerable, john abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture & rajpal yadav is the only saving grace in the movie. <br /><br />the second half of the movie is funny at times, but in all a dud (songs are boring) and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy.
