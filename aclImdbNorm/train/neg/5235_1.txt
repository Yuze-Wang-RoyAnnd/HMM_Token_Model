i can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this film's link with the eighties but i really wouldn't say it's an accurate depiction of most peoples' lives in that era - even on the poorest bradford estates. it is however typical of the blunt agitprop rubbish the dear old royal court theatre was churning out at that time. plenty of 'right-on' artistry for small, small audiences but enough well-connected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid playrights. ithe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience you'll find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in 'gregory's girl'. <br /><br />i would be tempted to call this a 'kitchen sink' drama but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry. however, as far as having a decent script is concerned, this film is indeed all washed up. for some reason it has accrued an odd following amongst guardian reading film-goers - i can only assume they get a visual frisson out of pretending to slum it. steer clear my friends. it is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the estates. it isn't..but it is grim. do the washing up instead.
