this is a very cheaply made werewolf flick. the video is dark and poorly lit. the audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. the script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun! [filled of course with silver bullets]. the acting is as wooden as the characters. the fx are non-existent,lots of extreme close-ups of werewolf jaws and biting. the only thing that is shown is lots of soft-core t&a. instead of dropping $30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic: "dog soldiers" with sean pertwee.
