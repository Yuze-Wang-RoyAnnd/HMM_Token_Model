this movie was heavily marred by the presence of steven seagal. or as i should say steven so-dull! like before seagal is either too good or too stupid to re-dub his own lines, leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped. a few films before this was he has done this too, but i don't think to this extent! to be honest the film looks pretty good, the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie! of course, all told, this film is pretty bad.<br /><br />it would have been much better without seagal who has become a cartoon of himself. don't bother. anything over a buck for this one is too much! i honestly think this is the last time for me and a seagal film. what's taken me so long to realize this?!
