if you haven't figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes. lilia is a widow. she has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out. she has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger. while checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared...the cabaret, where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her. the film is very misogamist. it's portrayal of men is dismal. which is rather odd as lilia stoops to jiggle around for them, not for money, but just for the hell of it. when she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again. she does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention. the other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short-lived. not short enough i say. she does find romance, however brief , with you guessed it....no surprises here we didn't see coming. though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way. maybe this film just isn't targeting my demographic- 30 male
