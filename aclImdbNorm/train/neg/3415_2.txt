in the standard view, this is a purely awful movie. however, it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale. i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie. andy griffith's ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime. i wouldn't waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it, but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on tv, check it out.
