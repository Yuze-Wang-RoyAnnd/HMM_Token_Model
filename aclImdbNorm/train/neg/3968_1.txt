if you have ever seen a movie by brian avenet-bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on imdb, you know that most of the comments and votes are faked. trust me: you will be bored! people of the production team write their feedback themselves (sometimes they even admit it). but that's not enough: they also click constantly "no" whenever there is a negative comment on the movie. that's why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones.<br /><br />the movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. believe me now! if not, you will believe me later!<br /><br />brian avenet-bradley might be quite a good business man. otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies. (okay, they are cheap, but nevertheless.) but as a creative person, he is a complete failure.
