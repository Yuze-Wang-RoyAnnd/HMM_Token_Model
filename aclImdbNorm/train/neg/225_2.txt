spoiler: the young lover, jed, is kicked out by the spinster, kate (andie mcdowell), because she wrongly believes that jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends. kate thought she caught them en flagrante delicto. kate throws jed's shoes out the door. jed reluctantly leaves, and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on. then he gets run over ("crushed", one of the meaning of the title) by a truck. and dies.<br /><br />"and then he gets run over by a truck." can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element? up to then, its a comedy that intends to be frothy, but lacks any real fizz. everybody but jed is just annoying. and then they kill jed, and everybody's sad, until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive, instead of destructive. i give it 2 ugh's.
