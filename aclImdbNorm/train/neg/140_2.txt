valentine is a horrible movie. this is what i thought of it:<br /><br />acting: very bad. katherine heigl can not act. the other's weren't much better.<br /><br />story: the story was okay, but it could have been more developed. this movie had the potential to be a great movie, but it failed.<br /><br />music: yes, some of the music was pretty cool.<br /><br />originality: not very original. the name `paige prescott' recognize prescott?<br /><br />bottom line: don't see valentine. it's a really stupid movie.<br /><br />1/10<br /><br />
