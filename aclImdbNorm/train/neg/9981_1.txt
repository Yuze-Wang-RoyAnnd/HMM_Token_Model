this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery. it fails badly at both. the only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie. the only comedy is the laugh i got when i saw how high the readers here ranked it. could there be two movies with the same name? the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that wasn't there.<br /><br />
