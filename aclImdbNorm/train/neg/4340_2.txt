carlito way, the original is a brilliant story about an ex-drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so he invests in a club and the deals with the trouble that comes with it.<br /><br />this film was....<br /><br />i saw the trailer and knew instantly it was going to be bad..but after dismissing films in the past and finding out they were great( lucky number slevin, tokyo drift)...i gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutes...<br /><br />the script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepare...it was weak, with weaker dialogue. it seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie. so brigante decides to beat a guy up for the girl....and she say's 'yes!' and if you need to act bad just throw racism around...as we learn from the 'italian mobsters'...<br /><br />the acting was terrible to say the least...i found 'hollywood nicky', hilarious.<br /><br />i absolutely hate all these musicians turning to movies. lets face it the only reason p diddy did this movie was so he could play a gangsters...the actress who plays leticia was weak but beautiful. the sex scene was weak but we got to see her..which was okay...<br /><br />but overall i expected it shed light on how carito ended up in prison and the love of his life...and the assassin towards the end completely added to the horrendous movie that is...<br /><br />carlito's way: rise to power..
