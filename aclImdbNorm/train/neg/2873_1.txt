this movie features a gorgeous brunette named danielle petty. she has stunning green eyes, and is in the first few scenes and the last scene. she is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive. she may not have a future as an actress, because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers.<br /><br />the movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it. it is not a good horror film, or a good fake journalistic report, or remotely well done. there is no skill apparent in it's production. it is like a bad student film. the story's horrific elements do not make you sick, it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick. i would give this movie zero stars if i could.
