not too keen on this really. the story is pretty horrid and unconvincing. i enjoyed the first 10 minutes, bill nunns good. after that it was pretty appalling. tim doesn't fit the role, he comes across as a smug self inflated ass & pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player. it's a idealist film and as a musician, feel slightly offended after watching it. there's no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates, he's completely self indulgent. i find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe i'm watching the wrong film. if you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle.
