(spoilers)<br /><br />i was very curious to see this film, after having heard that it was clever and witty. i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i felt.<br /><br />the idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. what made me dislike the whole film were two things.<br /><br />first of all, the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if, by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis, it became itself ordinary and dull.<br /><br />secondly, the overall sloppiness of the production, with dialogues that were barely understandable.<br /><br />too bad.
