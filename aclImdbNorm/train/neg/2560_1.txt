well i watched this last night and the one thing that didn't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward. there was no beating around the bush that this kid was the anti-christ. however the movie was just poorly written. for example, they never explained how they made the dentist incident an "accident" or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet. the death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all. the kid they chose to play the anti-christ was boring and they really could've picked a better kid. just don't waste your time watching this.
