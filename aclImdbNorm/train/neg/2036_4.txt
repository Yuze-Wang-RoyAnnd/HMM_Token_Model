the film is about a young man, michael, who cares for the elderly. one day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients. around the same time he decides to model his killing after the zodiac killer of the 60's. he gets in touch with the author of a book about the zodiac killer and they form a friendship. michael has a gun (aparently the only gun, as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors, only not portrayed as the same gun.) and he goes out a-killin'. original. <br /><br />this is a great film if you like b movies. i thought the idea of the movie was good, but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot. i thought the 'blood' was just too fake, the lighting was horrible in some places, and the dialog was just too standard. the movie was shot on video, which is okay, but the editing of the film just made for some weird 'plan 9' scenes. not a bad movie for fans of the b-movie genre, but if you want something with a bit more polish, move on to something else.
