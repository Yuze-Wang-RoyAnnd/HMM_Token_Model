spoiler: bunch of passive-aggressive people having family reunion. the script has them saying and doing things people would never do, at least anyone with a shred of decency. the hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion, unaware she will show up as his brother's girlfriend at the reunion. he tries to defer to his brother's claim, but she, knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her, teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper, rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch. at one point, she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him. he tries to cover his eyes. his heart is breaking. she thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion.<br /><br />the movie really drags. the audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul. the writing is unintelligent and unbelievable. we almost walked out, but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up, but nooooo. all the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills, out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this. comparing it to little miss sunshine??? jeez. shame on them, the writers, the actors, the producers, and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen!
