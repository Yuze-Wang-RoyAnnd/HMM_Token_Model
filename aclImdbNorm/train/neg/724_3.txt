the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one, that is aside from the musical perspective. it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set. the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror. had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film, however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't exactly sit well next to the songs. <br /><br />aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either, goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast. overall a disappointment.<br /><br />3/10
