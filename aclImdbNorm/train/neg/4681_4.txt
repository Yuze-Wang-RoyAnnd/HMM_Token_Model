we laughed our heads off. this script is so incredible you either zap to cnn or go to sleep.<br /><br />my dad was a sea captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie.<br /><br />during his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship, the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey/daily and (sorry) s**t on his desk. of course this was not on a nuclear mission.<br /><br />for instance, the fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. to give a drill at that time is just hollywood script. when a captain is put under arrest, he is under arrest, you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept. this is stored within minutes in a well guarded room. he cannot escape, it's just like in prison.<br /><br />funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how hackman let him pee in the control room. this is not done, ever. my dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was.<br /><br />hackman and washington make the three stars this movie is credited for, all the rest is bulls**t.<br /><br />when we do know that 23 people were still alive on the koersk, this film gets an extra dimension.<br /><br />if you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent: thas boat.<br /><br />
