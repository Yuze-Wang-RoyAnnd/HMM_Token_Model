okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious. some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot. unfortunately i would have to say that this was probably the worst movie i have seen this year. don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely. the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together. so overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now.
