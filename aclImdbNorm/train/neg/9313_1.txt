this was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen. i am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie. in fact, when i'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies. they are always good for a laugh, believe i know, i have seen many. but this movie was just so terrible it wasn't worth a chuckle. i was considering turning it off in the first five minutes... which i probably should have. there is nothing good about it, first and foremost, the camera crew suck3d a$$. the intro was stupid just like the ending. acting and special effects were terrible. please i'm begging you, do not watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it.
