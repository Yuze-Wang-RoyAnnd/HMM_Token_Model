i first saw the live musical at the denver center for the performing arts and it was absolutely mind-blowing, stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that i liked it much more than most musicals that i have seen on the stage. the interesting thing is that you never got to see zach's face. he was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production. whe i heard they were making a movie from it, i waited with bated breath, but when i watched the movie version i was so bummed-out disappointed that i felt i was cheated. the movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character. personally, i would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be revived, i would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it. it will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
