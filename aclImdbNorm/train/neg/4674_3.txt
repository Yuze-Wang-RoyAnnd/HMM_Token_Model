i do not know who is to blame, miss leigh or her director, but her performance as catherine is almost impossible to watch. ben chaplin on the other hand does a superior job - against all odds as far as i am concerned. his character is entirely too charming and appealing. but certainly not shown as greedy enough, to put up with leigh's character's silliness. chaplin appears bemused by what cannot possibly be understood as leigh's shyness and lack of grace, but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness. there has to be some element of believability to his interest, but as played it is incomprehensible. the performances do not jibe. maggie smith and albert finney are, of course, wonderful despite any effort to derail them. the supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch. what a pity, too, the leads don't work together because the production is lovely to look at.
