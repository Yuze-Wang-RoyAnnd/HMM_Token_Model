well, were to start? this is by far one of the worst films i've ever paid good money to see. i won't comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. to start with, the acting, except for eric bana, is soap opera quality. i've always been a fan of brad pitt, but here every actor on the bold and the beautiful puts him to shame. the camera action doesn't help, either. how it lingers on him when he's thinking, it just takes me back to brooke forrester's days in the lab! peter o'toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery, or he is desperately in need of one. either way, he looks more like linda evans than linda evans! and to end my comments, diane kruger is a cute girl, but she sure is no helen of troy. peterson should rather have chosen saffron burrows for the role, since elizabeth taylor would be rather miscast by now.
