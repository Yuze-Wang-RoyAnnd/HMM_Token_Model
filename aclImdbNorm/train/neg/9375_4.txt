it's about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old indian traditions. at times it is clear how most of the 'doctors' are charlatans, even lying about how they don't charge their clients. while they are wearing their gold watches, the 'donation' box is mandatory. notice that there are only a couple of people who get 'cured' while we see quite a few cases.<br /><br />keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest indian bank note is 5 rupee, while the average salary in india is 1,700 ru/month.
