what a piece of junk this movie was. the premise was okay, but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people (even the effects in hercules was better) i knew this would be bad. but the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs. it's completely incoherent, silly and stupid. i felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a d-. i want to slap casper van diem and the other actors for following this movie through.<br /><br />i've had my share of cheesy and bad movies (i love the tremors series), but this... i do not recommend it at all. it's silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe.
