arthur askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public. his juvenile jokes, silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world. a lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him, and he was never completely comfortable in films. he has his moments in the ghost train, and his character, tommy gander, has been tailored to make the most of his talents, but askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />askey's support in the film is not strong, it includes regular co-star richard murdoch; betty jardine and stuart latham as a dopey honeymoon couple; linden travers going over the top as a 'mad woman'. also on board are peter murray-hill, who off-screen married phyllis calvert, as the nominal leading man, giving a totally bland reading of the part, and leading lady carol lynne, who turns in an equally insipid performance. it is left to character actress kathleen harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on dr morland graham's brandy.
