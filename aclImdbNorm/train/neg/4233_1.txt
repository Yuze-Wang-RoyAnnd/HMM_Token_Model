i couldn't believe i spent $14.00 on this. the only redeeming quality is the outrageous gore. the dubbing was worse than any i have ever experienced. it looks like it was shot with a vhs camcorder. i think every pfennig was spent on the special effects because there was a whole lot of blood and body parts everywhere. its one of the worst movies i have ever seen but i do have to acknowledge the plentiful gore that wasn't as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so silly and unbelievable
