not much to say on this one. a plot you can pretty much peg, in the first 10 minutes. nothing overly wrong with this film, very little action for an action film. there was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally. whether an action film is the right genre to do that with, i'm still undecided. sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to, as it had little twists and a straightforward plot. i was probably guilty of that, so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be better.<br /><br />4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10's)
