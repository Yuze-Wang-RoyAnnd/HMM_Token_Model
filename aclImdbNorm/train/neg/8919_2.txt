i first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my tivo system. i like danny elfman and thought it might be interesting. on top of that, i'm a fan of max fleischer's work, and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon. with both of those, i thought it would hold my interest. i was wrong. just a few minutes in, and i had the fast forward button down. i ran through it in about 15 minutes, and thought that was it.<br /><br />afterwards, i read some of the other reviews here and figured i didn't give it enough of a chance. i recorded it again and watched it through. there's 75 minutes of my life i'm not getting back.<br /><br />i can't believe there aren't more bad reviews. personally, i think it's because it's hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum. how many ways are there to say this is a waste of time?<br /><br />the movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts, profanity, and puke jokes. the characters are flat. the parody of "swinging the alphabet" is lame, essentially cobbling the tune, getting through a - e, hitting the obvious profanity a "f", and then having no idea where to go. the trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn't work the first time, let alone the following ones. <br /><br />across the board, the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to "out-south park" stone and parker without the ability to determine what is and isn't funny. this might be amusing if you're high. otherwise, it's not.
