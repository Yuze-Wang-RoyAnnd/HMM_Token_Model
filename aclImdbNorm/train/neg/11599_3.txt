the only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches. <br /><br />(moderate spoiler alert) death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in twilight zone: the movie, which delivers death by cartoon. still this was handled nicely, especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out.<br /><br />additionally, there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle.<br /><br />having said that, i was glad i got the dvd cheap at a store going out of business sale, because this was pretty awful. i bought "soul survivors" at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream. however , where "soul survivors" has nothing to redeem it, or have it make any sense, this at least had a couple of stylish notes, referred to above.<br /><br />interestingly, the dvd lets you go to the 8 'nightmares' where something actually happens, which is the only way to watch this. the scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable.<br /><br />3 out of 10.
