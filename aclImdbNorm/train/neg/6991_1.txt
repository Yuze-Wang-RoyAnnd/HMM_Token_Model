just don't bother. i thought i would see a movie with great supspense and action.<br /><br />but it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. in the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed. towards the end the it gets better but not really great. i think the director took this movie just too serious. in such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action. i nearly dozed off in the middle/main part of it. rating 3/10.<br /><br />derboiler.
