there are some things i can never understand. such as this movie. what if i were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing? how can anyone even believe that an utterly fake cgi dinocroc that looks completely out of place, would influence the events in this movie? i know that its b-grade, low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through. it just does'nt make sense. are people really so stupid that they would sit through this? apparently so. for laughs? no, this thing isn't even worth laughing at.
