actually had to stop it. don't get me wrong, love bad monster movies. but this one was way too boring, regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere. the actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts, was way too obvious a clich'e. this film totally betrays the cover on the dvd which looks pretty interesting. from the cover one expects a giant monster, but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels. moved on to watch another film called the killer rats but that's another review. deep shock was really crap, a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget.
