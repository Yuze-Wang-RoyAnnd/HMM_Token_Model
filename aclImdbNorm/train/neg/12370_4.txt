they probably should have called this movie the map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery. not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are. the only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character. this of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the immortal hills cemetery. come on now , couldn't they have shown us just one of the death scenes? we hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don't get to see anything. some how i bury the living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone. unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better i movie , such as i spit on your grave or i drink your blood.
