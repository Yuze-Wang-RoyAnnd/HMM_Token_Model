i don't know who sue kramer, the director of this film is, but i have a strong suspicion that a) she is a lesbian and b) she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic.<br /><br />i can imagine everyone thinking, "my god, this is horrible. not funny. pedestrian. totally lame." but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti-gay or they "don't get" the gay lifestyle. (this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too.) anyway, it's not even worth reviewing. the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do. it's full of clich'es and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing - much less funny.<br /><br />i hated it and i'm not afraid to say so. too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb weren't as unbiased in their judgment.
