i chose "dead creatures" because i thought it was a zombies movie just like "28 days" or so... but not at all. it isn't even a horror movie. nothing happens, except for a group of women that seem to have been infected by a strange virus that make her to eat human flesh in order to survive. <br /><br />that plot gives rise to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism...<br /><br />very very bad movie.<br /><br />*my rate: 2/10<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />------------------
