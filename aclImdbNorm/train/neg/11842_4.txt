kirsten dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. you can tell always she's just "acting". i like izzard though. plot is awfully boring. the viewer has no real connections to the characters, never knowing who to really sympathize with, or even care about. slow, dull movie, with some laughs, but few and not very funny anyway. plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least. you can see each plot turn coming a mile away. what is this movie supposed to be? comedy? drama? who cares? you won't by the end of this film.
