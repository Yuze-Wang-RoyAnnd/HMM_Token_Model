dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. "wanders" is probably not the word. i should say he fixates on the past girlfriend. he recalls to the day when the relationship ended. the dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. he fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. i'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being "turned off" by his creepiness, starts to become interested in him. did i mention how creepy dave is? he sometimes refers to himself in the third person. he doesn't move his arms when he walks, either. it's just weird. too make a long story short, dave plots to hunt down mary (the old gal friend) and kill her...err...i mean confront her. he does so. which was really creepy. he believes her to be married, yet he still flies half-way across the country to meet her. he stakes out her house to make sure she is alone, before he "drops in" on her. he has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. we enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value. i am still entertaining the wife with my dave impressions...."i heard another dave & mary song!"
