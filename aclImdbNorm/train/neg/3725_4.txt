this is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial, (just read the other comments on this film). apparently, you either love it or hate it and it seems most people make that distinction based on whether they believe the tribulation and end times will happen as portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />basically, the film - and its sequels - were made for about $1.30 each. the production values are right down there with "plan 9 from outer space" and the acting is about on the same level as "glen or glenda", (my apologies to ed wood). putting aside the religious message, the story is as scary as they come. add in even the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even scarier.<br /><br />this movie, and its sequels, didn't try to bring in the reasons why the tribulation happened when it did. "left behind" and "the omega code" tried to get in everything "thief" did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the middle east leading up to it. the net effect was "thief" did a much better job on the scary part of movie, instead of spreading itself too thin trying to explain what was happening in the middle east at the same time. <br /><br />forget the politics and watch this movie, and its sequels, for what they are - horror stories. that they may be horror stories told, indirectly, by god makes them just that much more frightening. if it makes you think about the subject, it has done its job - even if you never believe.
