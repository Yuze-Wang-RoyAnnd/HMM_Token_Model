story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while. all the action is in the end, but you won't have to laugh because the movie is funny, but because the story is pathetic.<br /><br />the funniest part is when harvey 'i'm not paranoia' keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre. oscars for this guy!
