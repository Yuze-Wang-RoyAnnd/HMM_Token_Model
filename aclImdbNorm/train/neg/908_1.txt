after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good. nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features...but when i played the movie itself, what a let down. it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time. the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film. so don't believe it unless you like to waste your cash!
