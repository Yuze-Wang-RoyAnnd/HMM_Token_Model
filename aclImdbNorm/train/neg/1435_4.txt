this film was made in saskatchewan and manitoba parks and returned the world eye again to what little of the "wild western canada" is left. when archie began to write his stories for the papers; the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert/absorb the first nation peoples.<br /><br />the film puts forward and asks the question; why would a well-educated, obviously talented englishman become an indian?<br /><br /> archie, as an english boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless - no mater what it is. sounds like a famous puppet story doesn't it.<br /><br /> in my opinion, i saw archie become my living image of the "cigar store indian" a very wooden character and not real at all - very well done acting on the part of mr. brosnan. he also portrayed the wild indian in the dance scene for the tourist. the fullness and or reality of it weren't realized till he met and married his wife, annie.<br /><br /> annie pushed archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the englishman's world stage, not as himself but grey owl -an canadian native of the wilderness frontier.<br /><br /> this is the closest archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype.<br /><br /> mr. brosnan's interpretation as well as the directors is both well done. i have watched documentaries on grey owl and i think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection.<br /><br />spoiler - i thought the final scenes with archie going to meet the grand council of chiefs was a great a great moment in the film.<br /><br /> very beautiful canadian lake scenery and real "grey owl" locations.<br /><br />
