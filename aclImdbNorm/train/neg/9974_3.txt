i have to admit i've caught this one a few times on the usa network. there's just something about the, well, sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it's on. yes, you're right about the sub-par acting, the plot which only an seven year old could like, etc. but i can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors. then again, a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel.
