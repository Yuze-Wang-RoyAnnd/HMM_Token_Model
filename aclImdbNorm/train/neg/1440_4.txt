swayze doesn't make a very convincing alan quatermain. compared to stewart granger; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 "scaramouche", the 1952 "prisoner of zenda" and the 1950 "king solomon's mines"; patrick swayze fails utterly. even the portrayal of an older alan quatermain by sean connery in "league of extraordinary gentlemen" was very good in an otherwise big flop. also alison doody lacks the grace of deborah kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive siriaque in the role of umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (shoes)!!! for someone who was disappointed by richard chamberlain's 1985 version, i now highly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the granger version.
