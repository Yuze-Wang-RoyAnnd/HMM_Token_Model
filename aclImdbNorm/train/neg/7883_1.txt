the deceptive cover, title and very small hidden print of power of prayer tricked me into renting this movie.<br /><br />it started out really well and pulled me in. i really liked it. between 1/3 and 3/4's of it, the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense. my first thought was, "this is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story." i ended up re-watching parts of the movie, thinking i had missed something.<br /><br />by the time i reached the last 1/5 of the movie, it was all boring, annoying, religion thumping dialog that made no sense, said nothing, and was annoying to listen to; i turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the end.<br /><br />don't waste your time with this flick.<br /><br />beware of dvds labeled whitlow films and level path productions.<br /><br />and i'm a practicing catholic.
