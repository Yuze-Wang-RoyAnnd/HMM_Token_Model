i can't believe anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this movie. i'm a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy, and i can enjoy even old movies with ridiculous premises as long when they are written by someone other than a monkey. (see, for example, my glowing review of altered states [1980].)<br /><br />a monkey could have explained better exactly why i should for a second take seriously the basic idea behind this movie. the problem is not that the producers had a low budget--it's that they didn't care.<br /><br />now, to publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose glowing reviews appear on the box:<br /><br />chicago tribune<br /><br />san francisco chronicle<br /><br />san francisco bay guardian<br /><br />(actually, i enjoy reading the latter two. still, their movie reviewing credibility has gone through the floor. but i know if i ever make a movie with handheld camera, a cheesy plot and stupid effects, i'll show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about conceiving ada.)
