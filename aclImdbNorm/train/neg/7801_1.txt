i will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely warrants a mention. zombie 90 is one of the worst films ever made - right up there with schnaas' other horrible zombie entry - zombie doom (aka violent sh!t 3). these films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot. i somehow managed (barely...) to sit through zombie doom - but zombie 90 is so horribly inept - even when compared to schnaas' other horrible film - that i had to fast-forward through everything after the first 10 minutes. zero acting skills, inept gore, horrible camcorder-style camera-work, ridiculous dubbing...it just goes on and on. i really can't find a single thing redeeming about this garbage - and i can usually find something redeeming in just about any film. this truly is one of the worst films ever made - you've been warned...1/10
