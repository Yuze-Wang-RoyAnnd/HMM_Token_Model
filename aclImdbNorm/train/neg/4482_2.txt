a perfect little atrocity...i doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the reglamentary-mtv 4.4 seconds. woeful casting, worse even than in kusminsky's version (a reminder: he managed to miscast juliet binoche and ralph feinnnes). but, hey-the rich got what they deserved. dark and brooding heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden-locked angel, frail and angellic catherine presented as a chubby, melon-breasted heffer, meek and weak linton is a peeping tom, and innocent isabel becomes sara michelle-gellar's character from cruel intentions. 15-year old eddie bauer and abercrombie and fitch donners-take notice. this thing was made for you. it is an hour-and-a-half long music video where everything is given to you; you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from initial shock at their actions. the actors tried, but, as i stated before, they were miscasted. decent photography, but editing is on the level of tv production class in high school. i implore you all: read the book, or the cliffnotes even; watch the previous versions of it, even kusminsky's; but stay away from the numerous future reruns, during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial-free premiere.
