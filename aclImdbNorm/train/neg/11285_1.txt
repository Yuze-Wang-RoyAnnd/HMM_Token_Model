i read james hawes book. it was pretty neat, not great, but entertaining enough. without having read the book i wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on, and it was still a stretch with that knowledge.<br /><br />literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways i do not have the capacity to describe. half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick.<br /><br />never before or since as a film made me feel so angry. the mattress sequels came closest, but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did.<br /><br />since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind i am now unable to even look at any book by james hawes without feeling angry. that is the depth of hatred i have for this piece of sh*t. no, that's unfair. let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is rancid aluminium.<br /><br />plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema.
