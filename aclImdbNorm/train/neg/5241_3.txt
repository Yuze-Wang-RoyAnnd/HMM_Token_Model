tell the truth i'm a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people, which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie. and after having seen it, i was really a disappointed, and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie.<br /><br />i'm surprise at this movie all completely - it is like a kid's movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing. i'm not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account.<br /><br />synopsis: the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak.<br /><br />just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. the story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. and haven't we already seen the same characters (play by mc lovin') in so many other movies (like sasquatch gang?). i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.<br /><br />well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. and the acting is so-so as expected when you're watching this type of movie. and the direction, what do one expect? this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer, and that movie also sucks. but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie.<br /><br />anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time. only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie. can't really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />pros: elizabeth bank? two topless scenes.<br /><br />cons: not funny, dreadful story, nudity and kids do not mix together.<br /><br />rating: 3.5/10 (grade: f)
