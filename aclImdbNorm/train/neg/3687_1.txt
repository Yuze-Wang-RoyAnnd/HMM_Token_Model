it's not just that this is a bad movie; it's not only that four of the "best" mexican movie makers are in this film; and it's not only that the script is terrible. it's just that...this movie sucks...big time. this people are wasting money in terrible scripts. it's supposed to make a criticism about mexican society but we're fed up with this kind of films. is bad language supposed to be funny? i don't get it. mexican cinema is in big trouble if this kind of movies are going to continue playing (and being written and produced).<br /><br />please, don't think this kind of movies are well received in mexico: we hate them and they don't reflect us.
