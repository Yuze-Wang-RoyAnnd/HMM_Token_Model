the movie had a good concept, but the execution just didn't live up to it.<br /><br />what is this concept? well, story-wise, it's "dirty harry" meets "m". a child killer has begun terrorizing a city. the lead detectives (dennis hopper and frederic forest) have never dealt with a serial killer before. the mayor and the police chief, in desperation, secretly hire the local mob to speed things up...to go places and do things that the police wouldn't be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible.<br /><br />to be fair, this film does genuinely have some good things to offer.<br /><br />besides the concept, i liked the look of the killer's hideout. norman bates has his basement. this guy has an eerie sewer. in some of the shots, the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls; often giving these scenes a creepy, dreamlike quality.<br /><br />the acting was good too. dennis hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age.<br /><br />once you get past that, however, it more-or-less goes downhill.<br /><br />the film is paced way too fast. the actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating. this could have been fixed in two ways: either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots. either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery.<br /><br />for an example of how bad this is, one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this: at one point in his life, the suspect went to a pet shop...that's right...i'm being totally serious here. it's like they went from point a (the first clue) to point z (the suspect) and skipped over all the "in-between" steps.<br /><br />then there's the characters. the only ones i actually liked were two pick-pockets you meet about half-way through the movie. considering that they're minor characters, i'd call that a bad sign.<br /><br />finally, there's the mob angle. this is the one that gets me the most because this is why i coughed up the $3 to buy the dvd in the first place. i mean, what a hook! there's been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 10-15 years. the mob angle was a gimmick that could have helped it rise above the rest..., but it didn't.<br /><br />i figured the gangsters's methods would be brutal, but fun and thrilling at the same time; kind of like a vigilante movie or something...maybe they'd even throw in some heist movie elements too. we are talking about criminals, after all. instead, we're given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid. the detectives question witnesses. what does the mob do? they interrogate and kill them. it's not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either. i actually found the criminals less likable than the killer they're hunting.<br /><br />unless the good points i mentioned are enough to get your interest, i'd say give this one a miss. maybe some day, they'll reuse the same story idea and do it right. i hope so. i hate to see such a good concept go to waste.
