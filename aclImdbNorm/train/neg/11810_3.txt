i noticed with some amusement that in the end credits, the detroit pd is thanked for their participation. the chief of police even has one speaking line playing himself (and boy, can you tell he can't act). the reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later. not the kind of pr, i would think a police force would want. other than that, this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the '70's with a racial angle. alex rocco is given a thankless role of a lifer cop that can't get ahead and is saddled with a mentally ill wife. he makes up for this by hanging out at the local whorehouse. hari rhodes is his dashing partner that has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat. the movie moves along until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense (why do people that are only guilty of a robbery, take on a whole police force?). not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys, we get to see four. then there is a twist ending that is supposed to leave one guessing what really would have happened but only left me thinking how stupid it was. seeing that director arthur marks was also behind the braindead "friday foster" and "bucktown", i shouldn't have wondered.
