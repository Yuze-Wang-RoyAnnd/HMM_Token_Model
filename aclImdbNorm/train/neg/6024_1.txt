i watched about 30 minutes into this film before i finally got sick of getting bludgeoned over the head with this movie. the soundtrack, the so-called 'plot', and each and every actor. it's like they all think they're the main part of the movie and scream "notice me!" over and over again. the bad guy has his bad-guy music going on and says sinister bad-guy-like things, just in case you didn't quite catch on. the good guy does brave and noble things just in case you didn't know he was the good guy. and oh lord, the plane scene. "my husband is missing! oh my god! it's impossible that he got up to stretch his legs or go to the toilet or anything, he must be missing!" (and yes, i know, his clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and started to panic before she even had time to look at the damn seat he'd been in.)<br /><br />as a religious girl, i want to apologize to the world for wasting the film this was printed on.<br /><br />and i want my 30 minutes back.
