so 'thinner'... yep.. this steven bachman (read steven king) yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a gypsy elder who he just killed, the story itself is there, no doubt about it, but i don't know why i didn't enjoy it more than i could have. i guess what really distracted me was the actors. i mean, who's the lead? robert john burke? who's he? and fer crying out loud, can someone please stop hiring joseph mantegna for every italian mafioso role there ever is? and while we're at it, does every mafioso have to have a pasta cooking italian mother? the only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup, michael constantine as the gypsy elder. he's pretty good. but the rest, i make you all, "better actors..."
