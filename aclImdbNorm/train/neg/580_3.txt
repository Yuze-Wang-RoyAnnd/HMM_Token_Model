really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement.<br /><br />this vampire's hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far, derek bliss (jon bon jovi), travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers!, he use some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to blade), and is part of some van helsig vampire's hunters net?, ok, but he work alone. he's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight (is almost a sequel of vampires (1998) directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods), derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends: sancho (diego luna, really bad acting also) a teenager without experience, father rodrigo (cristian de la fuente) a catholic priest, zoey (natasha wagner) a particular vampire and ray collins (darius mccrary) another expert vampire hunter. so obviously in this adventure he isn't alone.<br /><br />you can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor (jon bon jovi); is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods, and then, if you watch the film (i don't recommend this part), you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories, totally predictable, with terrible acting performances, really bad special effects and incoherent events!.<br /><br />i deeply recommend not to see this film!, rent another movie, see another channel, go out with your friends, etc.<br /><br />3/10
