i was really looking forward to watching this, being that i love danny dyer and i think gillian anderson is a gifted actress. the beginning was interesting. i liked the relationship between the two stars. it then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and dyer gets beaten extremely bad while anderson gets raped. they then decide to go for some revenge. sounds good, right? well, it's not. the story gets boring and side-tracked, and certain things get really weird. i won't give out any details, but things happen that i, for one, have no desire to see. i like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and i really wanted to like this one. it just didn't work out. i give it a 3 out of 10, mainly for the acting.
