the movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (i'm sorry i'm biased, i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies), and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than azumi 1. i watched azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. i amazed myself being able to sit through it. <br /><br />lets talk about the plus points of the movie. the girl. ueto aya is cute. thats all there is to salvage the whole movie. the fact is, if the main character was male, i am sure that most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. <br /><br />now lets talk about the minus points. firstly, it is real draggy, with lots and lots of repeated scenes. scenes of nachi and azumi keeps coming back. it seems more like a drama way of shooting. typical japanese dramas love flashbacks, and this movie too. secondly, the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting. i do not mind unrealistic movies. but this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness, by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs, etc... it reminds me of shinobi, though shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. moreover, to portray "i-don't-know" what effect, the director films people dying with blood spraying (literally) all around... people not realizing their head was cut off... etc.. etc... etc... too many of these spoils the show. it seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie. it degrades the show greatly. thirdly, isn't azumi supposed to be an assassin. she seems more like an one-man-army to me, just that she is a female. i don't think you see assassins charging into army camps. the only time i felt she acted "assassin-liked" was when she killed the kiyomasa kato at the end of azumi 1. lastly, the plot was thin in both movies. its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.
