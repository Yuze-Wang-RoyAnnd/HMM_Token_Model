there are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one. even if you were totally oblivious of ed wood's work, one look at that commentator from "plan 9 from outer space" and you just know you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece. just like that, when i saw the first shot of uwe bolls masterpiece "house of dead", with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from sin city, i knew i'm in for a helluva ride.<br /><br />so, the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die. you know, to keep you wandering. then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like "karma..thinks she's foxy brown" or "alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.. i had to study and she had to fence". no, i'm not kidding.<br /><br />anyway, this bunch of 20-somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper-bag are going to the "rave of the century", rave in question being a few tents, a port-a-potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the pacific. our gang missed the ferry, but thankfully will find a way to get there, the way being a fisher-boat ran by kirk (cpt kirk? get it? man, whoever wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick who is a bastard child of simpsons' cpt mcallister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.<br /><br />to make the long story short, the gang gets to the island, finds nobody there except some bloody t-shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. no wait, they do not, they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze.<br /><br />with that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill. some guys in rubber suits start running around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, meet cpt kirk and some police woman (who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons) and then decide to go back to the house. somewhere along the line they transform into a s.w.a.t. team, enter the matrix, the rubber-suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and i start to cry because i actually paid to see this. to add insult to the injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game-over cut-scene for a few characters when they die.<br /><br />i seriously hate this movie. it doesn't even fit in that famed "so bad it's good" category. it's just plain bad. the script is bad, the zombies are awful, there is no tension, lines are bad, actors are bad.. the list just goes on.<br /><br />you will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful. don't. there are bad movies that deserve to be watched. this is not one of them.
