i have begun to melt so i will make this review as short and sweet as possible.<br /><br />there's this astronaut, and he goes up in a spacecraft with two other guys, ya know? except something happens that exposes him to radiation, and then when they come back...well, never mind what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut has begun to melt! no, not just burn up, but melt! like an ice cream cone in july! well ok maybe not that fast, but ya know what i mean.<br /><br />anyway, he gets all red & gooey, and the fact that he's melting makes him really mad. i guess he also checked out the "melting man" handbook because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from totally melting away, he has to eat human flesh, so he starts ripping people apart.<br /><br />there are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need any others? what's important is who will he munch next, and what will be left of them? how long will it take for him to just melt away to nothing? why was this movie made in the first place? where did they get the money? when will you fall asleep while watching it?<br /><br />i've very nearly melted, but i still have enough time left to tell you that this movie is dreadfully boring, even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross. the makeup is neat but everything else is...splat
