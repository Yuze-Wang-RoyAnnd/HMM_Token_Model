i registered for imdb just to comment on this movie. <br /><br />i just got done sitting through this movie, and the only thing that impressed me, was that i somehow had the will power to not stop it.<br /><br />i've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not, but princess blade has some of the worst fights i've ever seen in a movie. most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent isn't doing the same. i've seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots.<br /><br />so now we have a "futuristic" action movie with poor action, and virtually no sign of the future. <br /><br />most of the movie doesn't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the princess and the farmboy/terrorist and his disturbed sister. the movie has multiple plot lines, and none of them really pan out to be worth anything. <br /><br />part of the problem may have been that i watched the dub, which was quite bad. the entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on. but i got the general idea. (knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes)<br /><br />if you've heard about this being a futuristic action/ninja flick, then you've heard wrong. thats what i thought it was when i heard about it, and now i've lost 90 minutes of my life. don't let this happen to you. steer well clear of it.
