incredibly muddled, off-putting and ultimately ludicrous ("the horses, oh my god, the horses!") thriller. it's creepy at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film. watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody "magically" does exactly what the plot needs for the "resolution" to occur. bland performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by richard lynch. the video transfer is a real hack job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
