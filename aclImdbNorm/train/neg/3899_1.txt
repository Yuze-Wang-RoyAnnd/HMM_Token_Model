where do i start? per the title of this film i expected some degree of authenticity, in the end i was severally let down. this is not the story of lale andersen or the song lili marlene, rather it is a hollywood (or pick your film making hub) story loosely based on some real life characters. i should have had a clue when i heard a heavy english accent giving the intro to the movie in german; the blood red text (title, artists) should have been the 2nd clue. the story line is contrived (lale was not tricked out of switzerland rolf liebermann's parents, there is no info that liebermann helped smuggle jews from germany, the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the ns regime not while under control, the record played at the station was picked up in vienna while a lt. was there on leave, etc, etc) the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames (ss black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions, these went away from daily use once the war started, etc), the characters are stereo types (sa bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power). don't waste your time.
