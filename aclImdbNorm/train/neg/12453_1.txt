i had always been a big lynda carter-wonder woman fan so when the sci-fi channel ran this movie,i had to see it.i was bitterly disappointed.this is a wonder woman movie in name only.she doesn't wear the right costume [she must have refused to or had ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a poor man's james bond.there's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will.it's just one long bad dream.i don't even think cathy is all that attractive anyway.i wouldn't waste your time on this.
