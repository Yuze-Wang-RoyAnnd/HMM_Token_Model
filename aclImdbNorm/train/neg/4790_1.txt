i loathed this film. the original phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery. like many 70s horror flicks, it looked and felt like some creepy, unfinished documentary. phantasm ii, from the late 80s, pumped up the action, but maintained this nice attention to mood. sadly, phantasm iii is just awful. it tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films, which diminishes rather than expands their power. it shamelessly degrades imagery from the first phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original. there are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs. hundreds hang from the ceiling like christmas balls swaying in the draft. didn't anyone-- the prop master, the dp, the editor, the director-- notice or care that they looked so crummy? even worse, phantasm iii presents one corny, unfunny joke after another. how different from the intensity of the first film. the original phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death. phantasm iii uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about reggie's horniness: several refer to the film's "flying balls" ha-ha, oh, i get it, balls. maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes, but they are on us.
