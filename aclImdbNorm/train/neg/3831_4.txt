i'm going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with maltin on this one. this is a second rate, excessively vicious western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the wild west being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time. it would like to be in the tradition of "butch cassidy and the sundance kid", but lacks that film's poignancy and charm. andrew mclaglen's direction is limp, and the final 30 minutes or so are a real botch, with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes charlton heston and chris mitchum. (someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire.) there was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true. coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge, but all of his fellow escapees are underdeveloped (they're like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward). michael parks gives one of his typically shifty, lethargic, mumbling performances, but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about.
