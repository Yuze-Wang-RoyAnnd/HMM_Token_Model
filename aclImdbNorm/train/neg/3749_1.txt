wow, i love and respect pretty much anything that david lynch has done. however, this movie is akin to a first filmmaker's attempt at making a pseudo art video. <br /><br />to give you a couple of examples: <br /><br />1. david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker, however, this had little visual artistic content (blank walls, "up shots" with ceiling in the background) <br /><br />2. david lynch typically takes great pride in audio, however, in this you could even hear the video camera's hum. <br /><br />in fact, it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie. unless...<br /><br />...this is a joke, on david's part, to force fans search his website (for hours) only to find this drivel. i hope so, because at least that idea is funny.
