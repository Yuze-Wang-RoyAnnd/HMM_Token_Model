i'm not sure what hk movies the other reviewers have been watching, but enter the eagles is nowhere near the top of the heap in hk action. michael "fitz" wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in hk, because he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag in english. shannon lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with the leg fighting than her dad), but her acting skills are also sub-par. in fact, all the english dialog (90% of the movie--even more than in gen-y cops) is so bad that i switched to mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the english subs. sure, there are some decent gunfights (but nothing we haven't already seen before) and good cinematography, but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action.<br /><br />that said, it's worth the price of admission to watch shannon and benny "the jet" urquidez go at it. spectacular, and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for.<br /><br />finally, you might notice some scenes that seem "familiar" to you, notably a shootout at an outdoor market (think matrix) and fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues (think mi:2). guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off.
