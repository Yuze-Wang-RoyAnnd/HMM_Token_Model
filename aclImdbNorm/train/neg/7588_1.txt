a warning to potential viewers: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story "the most dangerous game," look elsewhere. "seven women for satan"<br /><br />only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of zaroff and having said character murder people.<br /><br />some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers. or not.<br /><br />boris zaroff is played by writer/director michel lemoine. whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging, boris' victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves. the film rambles from scene to scene with a near-total lack of clarity. the director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film. a few individual scenes are mildly interesting (such as a torture rack sequence), but as a unit, the film fails to entertain. viewers who are more<br /><br />interested in an assortment of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of undress might find the film watchable. most will probably find their time is better spent watching mentos commercials.<br /><br />in a side note, the dvd extras included a fair amount of information on the film's history. apparently, it was banned for several years in its native france which pretty much ruined any chance it had for widespread distribution.
