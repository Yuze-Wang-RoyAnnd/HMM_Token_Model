this is not a very good telling of the tarzan epic. there was only one reason for this movie. john derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the buff! bo derek in '10' was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex. this movie is nothing more than soft porn. if you're into that, well, then fast forward to it and skip the rest! this movie (like bolero) was again a vehicle for bo derek to show off her terrible acting. she is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! richard harris was a better actor than this; this was one of his few mistakes! don't waste your time on this movie...go buy the book instead.
