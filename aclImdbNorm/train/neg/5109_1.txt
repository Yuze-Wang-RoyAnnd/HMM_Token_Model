"extreme makeover: home edition" is yet another 'feel-goody', so-called 'heart warming', and out-for-ratings show that abc has had the time to put together.<br /><br />i understand the troubles that these families go through. for that, i am sorry. but wouldn't you think that putting four wide-screen plasma televisions, three flat-screen desktop computers, an inground pool taking up half of a backyard, and closets full of expensive designer clothing is a bit too excessive for any family? sure, these families have been through a lot. sure, they deserve nicer things that what they had previously had.<br /><br />but honestly, the things that ty pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit an entire neighborhood.<br /><br />another thing that really irks me about this show is how ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family, or the family's condition. telling a wheelchair-bound person that he or she is 'so strong', or 'very brave' really does get old after a while. that may sound rude, but believe me; watch this show, and you'll see what i mean.<br /><br />all in all, this show is overrated. if you want to watch it, go ahead. this comment is just a heads-up for what you'd be watching.
