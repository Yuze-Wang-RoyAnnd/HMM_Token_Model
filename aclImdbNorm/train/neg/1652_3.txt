i'll be blunt and to the point. this film is not good at all. the film buff part of me hated the acting, script, story, direction and almost all of the editing. amanda peet has proven that she can act, as she was a high point of 'the whole nine yards'. so she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole. however, the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny. if you can forget about how underpar the production quality is, and if you find smut jokes funny, then you should be all right. and for those of you who can't get off your pedestal, thats your choice. my inner child hasen't died, and i laughed a fair bit. even then, only a 3 out of ten, because as a movie, it really does stink.
