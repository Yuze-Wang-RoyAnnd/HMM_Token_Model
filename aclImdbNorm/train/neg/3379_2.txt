i recently bought the dvd, forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of "a chorus line." every change the director attenborough made to the story failed.<br /><br />by making the director-cassie relationship so prominent, the entire ensemble-premise of the musical sails out the window.<br /><br />some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed. the show's hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to cassie's character.<br /><br />the overall staging is very self-conscious.<br /><br />the only reason i give it a 2, is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.
