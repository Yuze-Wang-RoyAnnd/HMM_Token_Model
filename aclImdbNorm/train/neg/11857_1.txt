worst movie ever made!!! please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this movie.check rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film. the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film. i find the positive comments very misleading. i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech. don't waste your hard earned money!!!!!! this film is retarded!! i can't believe a film like this would ever be made. why would hollywood waste their time on such junk? this film is an attempt at nothing. i ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash. i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money. i didn't listen and i did waste my time and cash. please don't make the same mistake! it really is the "worst movie ever made!"
