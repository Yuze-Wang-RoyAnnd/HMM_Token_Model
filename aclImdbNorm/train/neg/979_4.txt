anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics. everyone says star wars and star trek are the best science fiction films to begin at, which is fine but the truth is the terminator and this movie, soylent green, are far better choices than those series. soylent is probably science fiction 's best kept secret. it remains one of the biggest, yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day. charlton heston overdramatizes his role, yet it works. edward g. robinson, in his final role, makes the most out of it in soylent green more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />it is manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $150). a big executive for the soylent company is murdered and police detective thorn is on the case.<br /><br />the secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie. soylent is enjoyable to watch, but the whole screenplay is a joke. it is just as cheap as the entire production. the screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie, yet were completely hilarious. everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules, specifically cop thorn who likes to just waltz into people 's apartments, peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants. the character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie, but still you realize that soylent green sucks. an enjoyable piece if you have the time, but do not expect anything more.
