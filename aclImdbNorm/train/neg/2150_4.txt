you will recognize the plot immediately. daughters of a divorced couple trying to get mom and dad back together again. yes, that was the theme of the parent trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. but here's the spooky thing. even though deanna durbin was younger than the 21 year old hayley mills while playing the doting daughter(s) roles, durbin looks much older, as in adult. and so do all of her so-called siblings. <br /><br />and this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film. the girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film. so you're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. when ray milland and others start "hitting on" them you get the feeling as if they're pedophiles, and you might be one, too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out. teens or temptresses, little girls or little foxes, you are never quite sure what you're supposed to be thinking of them as.<br /><br />the parents, too, seem very old and the whole film seems very dated.<br /><br />it is a rusty version of the parent trap and you should avoid it, or at least ensure your tetanus shots are up to date if you don't believe me.
