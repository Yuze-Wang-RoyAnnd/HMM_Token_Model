i am not sure why i like dolph lundgren. i guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. that is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. some of the other reviews point out how dumb detention is, but many neglect to point out the positives. <br /><br />any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed can't be all bad. why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens? aren't there any other kind of teens? does every group of teens have one angry black guy? one genius nerd that nobody likes? one slutty girl who is very friendly and (in this movie) pregnant? one disturbed anti-social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented (but what is the talent?). and one laid-back black kid who is in tune with the universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him. then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color. they don't say much but get shot at some point. <br /><br />detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school. preferably with the writers inside. the dialogue is bad, and the plot is worse. when the bad guys (and girl) finally hijack a van full of drugs, then they sit inside the van making out. they drive the van to the school because they want to re-paint the van at the school's paint shop, but they never get around to re-painting the van. by the way, it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the police van. they also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score. <br /><br />for some reason, they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher (dolph lundgren) even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours. the handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles, so why go after them? <br /><br />anyhow, the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns, and they keep finding the teens (including a guy in a wheel chair) and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss. towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed. for every time someone gets shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss. the stunts are pretty bad. <br /><br />i read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of $10 million, and i am amazed. when i saw the movie i figured maybe lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher. like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam. it was a test to watch it, but i passed.
