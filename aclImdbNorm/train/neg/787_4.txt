as an inspiring director myself, this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for dof. the editing is good acting decent, sound effects aren't too over the top. i would have give it a 7 for an indie film, but the story aren't that interesting. it's more on the drama side, character developments than a horror flick.<br /><br />it's not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out, or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy.<br /><br />honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's<br /><br />this movie is about a family who has a dry field, and that is just that.
