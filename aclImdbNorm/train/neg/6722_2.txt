you ever sit through a movie and after it's all over it's like one big "wtf!?". <br /><br />welcome to decoy. <br /><br />another straight to video action fodder flick you can immediately forget about having watched or better yet don't watch it at all. peter weller and robert patrick star and are quickly wasted in this going nowheres fast mercenaries-for-hire action dud where the story is pretty darn bad and the action sucks and what's the point of watching an action flick if the action blows? robert patrick in particular hits a new low in an action sequence that has him firing a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus. co-stars the ambient charlotte lewis and canada's own scott hylands (of tv's night heat fame).
