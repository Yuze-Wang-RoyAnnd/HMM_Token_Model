first, before reading further, you must understand that i'm not neo-nazi, i'm just trying to understand correctly hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again.<br /><br />i've seen this series and found it awful. i mean, ok, it's interesting to look, but is it real? i searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. first, hitler wasn't angry all his life, the series shows an angry hitler, even when he is a child. second, hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact, it is highly probable that hitler, in reality, was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret. third, people will hate me but it's true: hitler was charming. how do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly? because he was charming. that's a common point i found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him (of course, not jews).<br /><br />this series was awful because if you think that hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly, and of course, not charming at all, you're wrong. if you think that, you will let people like him take power in countries and you don't want that. if you really understand how hitler managed to get into power, and stop thinking he was just awful, you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember he was elected) and stop theme before it's too late.<br /><br />life is important to protect, this series is just awful to show us the truth, if we continue to see hitler like that, another one will take place exactly as the first did.
