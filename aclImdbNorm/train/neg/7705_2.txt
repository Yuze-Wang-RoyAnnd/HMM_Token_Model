(spoilers)<br /><br />i shoulda figured. the dvd didn't even show the time or how long it was. i thought wild cardz was the worst anime movie i'd ever seen. this one is much worse. makes no sense. thrown together plot. all so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that doesn't support them. <br /><br />it had to of been a student film. that musta gotten a c grade<br /><br />2/10<br /><br />quality: 1/10 entertainment: 6/10 (until i found out it wasn't going to end.) the ending made no darn sense<br /><br />replayable: 0/10
