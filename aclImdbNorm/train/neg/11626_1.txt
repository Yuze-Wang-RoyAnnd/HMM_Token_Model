this may be the worst show i've ever seen. aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about hitler, it just isn't funny or entertaining in any way. it is very similar to a 1950's sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations, but while it can be well done like in i love lucy, it's just not funny here. i think the show was based around the novelty "look, it's hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure" but it just fell flat in every regard. the guy playing hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone. i wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air. i thought america had some tasteless show, but the brits had us beat this time. america would never air a sitcom about hitler, although we did have that show about lincoln's slave, the secret diary of desmond pfeiffer. chances are you'll probably never see this show, since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on dvd.
