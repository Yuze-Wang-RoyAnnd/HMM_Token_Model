this movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite. not that i expect a great deal of plausibility in movies, but you'd think that even the homeless and urban-dwelling jack mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide. and upon reaching the hunting grounds, poor ice-t plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he's never seen before.<br /><br />and how does jack mason find thomas burns back in seattle?<br /><br />i'm assuming this movie was based on richard connell's short story "the most dangerous game." a few years ago i showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story. i reedited the movie, cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity. it ended up being 43 minutes long.
