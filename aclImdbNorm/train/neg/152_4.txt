you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers.<br /><br />i'm sorry, but spielberg didn't deserve to win any oscar for this piece, and i think the academy was right in that vote. (other oscars for best actor nominations and such... that i don't know about. but it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) the way spielberg directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome. while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me: "sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered. sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life." this is over-the-top sentimentality. when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity, as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found? there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around miss millie's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's singing... on and on. nothing rings true. i even wondered if harpo's name was chosen purposefully because it's his wife sophia's real name, "oprah," backwards. spielberg isn't above such "cuteness."<br /><br />it's not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion. schindler's list was amazing, deeply touching for me, and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism, even if the story is a bit contrived.
