race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast till you've driven 150, and 150 mph seems fast till you've driven 250.<br /><br />ok.<br /><br />andalusian dog seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen eraserhead, and eraserhead seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen begotten.<br /><br />and begotten seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen the works of c. frederic hobbs. race fans, there is nothing in all the world of film like the works of c. frederic hobbs.<br /><br />alabama's ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot, and it only involves hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants and mystery gas. and the fabulous woodmobile, cruising the sunset district in san francisco, of course.<br /><br />what's really startling is that somebody gave him a lot of money to make alabama's ghost. there's sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. somehow that makes alabama's ghost so wrong. you watch some awful cheeseball like night of horror or plutonium baby, and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their discover cards. but alabama's ghost was made with an actual budget, and that's evil. i mean, i've got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in thunder bay, ontario, building a secret temple in the woods out of twizzlers, and nobody's beating down my door waving a checkbook - how did this guy get the funds for four of the flakiest movies ever made?
