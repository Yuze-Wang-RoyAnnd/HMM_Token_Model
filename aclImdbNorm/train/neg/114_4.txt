its not the cast. a finer group of actors, you could not find. its not the setting. the director is in love with new york city, and by the end of the film, so are we all! woody allen could not improve upon what bogdonovich has done here. if you are going to fall in love, or find love, manhattan is the place to go. no, the problem with the movie is the script. there is none. the actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. in the director's own experience in hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. it is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. so, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.
