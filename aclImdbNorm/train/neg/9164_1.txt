i must preface this by saying i am a huge romantic. hence i really wanted to like this film. so i'm writing my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment i felt watching it. the leap years tells the destiny-filled tale of li-ann who falls for the suave jeremy and they commit to meet every leap year. a very romantic premise, based on a great short story and with a cast that doesn't feel like you're watching yet another jack neo flick. then why oh why is it so bad? firstly, i feel the filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video, because they chose to replace storytelling and any true emotions with cheesy montages, predictable actions and clich'ed lines. i am both upset and embarrassed to have been one of the first few in singapore to watch the leap years, but those of us in the cinema would agree that our muffled groans at the cringe-worthy performances spoke volumes. my hope was to watch a romantic movie that would surpass forever fever, the best singaporean romantic comedy so far, and the leap years does not even come close. some blogs have called it the crap years which is harsh but ultimately true. don't waste your money or your emotions like i did. the movie will make you give up on love forever.
