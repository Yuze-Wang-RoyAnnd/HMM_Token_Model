this movie shows how racist john singleton is. he portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system. how quick he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it. ice cube's character is the epitome of an instigating black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film. singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other. when omar epps says " i need to be with my people", that racist remark spoke volume. and john, don't think for a minute that the picture of thomas jefferson in the tower stairwell did not get my attention. nice touch!
