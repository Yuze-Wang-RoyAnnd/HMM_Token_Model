is it a coincidence that orca was made two years after jaws? orca isn't exactly a "jaws rip off" but it is obvious that it tried to profit from jaws's success. first of all orca in my opinion was a bad movie, not terrible but definitely not good, average at best.<br /><br />the plot is basically a male killer whale (orca) after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge. i couldn't stand to watch this movie again. the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director, producers, and writers were almost talentless.<br /><br />as for the acting, it was very average and believable, however the actual characters aren't the least bit likable. the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good.<br /><br />the violence is confusing, bloody, and not recommended for more sensitive people. the music is overdone and very loud, drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times. i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales don't mate with only one mate as depicted in orca).<br /><br />overall this movie was bad/poor in my opinion, because of the reasons listed above. some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so i'm not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like it.<br /><br />my rating: 3.5/10 (but for its concept possibly a 5/10)
