as an ex-teacher(!) i must confess to cringing through many scenes - 'though i continued to watch to the end. i wonder why?! (boredom, perhaps?) :-)<br /><br />the initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly mish-mashed and unfocussed. the plot, too, although there were some good ideas - the plight of a relief teacher, for example - were not concentrated enough in any one direction for 3-d development.<br /><br />not one of mr nolte's finer moments. as to young mr macchio, does he speak that way in *every* movie?<br /><br />plot and acting complaints aside, the hair-styles alone were a nostalgic (if nauseating) trip.<br /><br />
