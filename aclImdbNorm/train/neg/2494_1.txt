what a joke. i am watching it on channel 1 and i think watching paint dry is much more entertaining. what happened to caspar van dien that got him roped into this nightmare. terrible acting, very boring plot and terrible direction. it so terrible, it's funny. it's suppose to be full of suspense, but it more a comedy. if you want to see terrible acting, ridiculous script writing and sub-par plot, check this movie out. if i was van dien, i would not only ask for my 10% from my agent, but fire the bastard in the process. what a turkey. it's not even fit to be on mst 3k!! it would be a good movie to cure you insomnia. i especially love the part where van dien is throw overboard and then makes it back in just a few minutes! i can only image that this was written by non-union writers taking advantage of the writer's strike. what a horrible movie!!!
