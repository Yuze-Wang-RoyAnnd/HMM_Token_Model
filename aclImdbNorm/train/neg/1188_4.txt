kurosawa really blew it on this one. every genius is allowed a failure. the concept is fine but the execution is badly blurred.<br /><br />there is an air of fantasy about this film making it something of an art film. the poverty stricken of tokyo deserve a fairer and more realistic portrayal. many of them have interesting stories to tell. a very disappointing film.
