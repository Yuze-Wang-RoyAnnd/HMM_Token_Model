i can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton, and sure it's his company. but "you're fired" or "you're hired", for how many seasons now? after watching the show i wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.<br /><br />i'd love to hear just one person get up and say "donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo". i see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe. i hope he gets hurt so i don't have to see his pathetic face anymore. it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. i'd give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that.
