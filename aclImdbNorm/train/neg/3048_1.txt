this is perhaps the creepiest display of santa claus ever committed to any medium, whether it be a book, a picture, or a movie. santa looks like a perv looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing merlin in to help him defeat one of satan's minions, pitch, doesn't make things any better. it's laughable to say the least, with bad effects, even for 1959 standards. if a kid were to watch this movie, he'd have nightmares and never want santa to visit. they'd be scarred for life. imagine the kid's in "a christmas story" when they start screaming after being put on santa's lap. that's how this would turn out if kid's see this movie.
