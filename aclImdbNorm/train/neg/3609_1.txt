this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen. i remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason i thought i enjoyed it. so, like an idiot, i ran out to purchase the dvd once it was released...what a tragic mistake! i won't even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow. i am a fan of herschell gordon lewis so i am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level. it is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible...if that was their goal, they suceeded. if they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way, shape, or form that it is real then they failed...miserably! avoid this movie...read the plot synopsis and you've seen it!
