there seem to have been any number of films like this released during the 70's. and the fact that i cannot recollect the title to a single one of them off-hand is a measure of their impact. these are what novelists would call 'pot-boilers'. they are scarcely more than a vehicle for keeping movie-stars in the public eye.<br /><br />we have micheal caine, peter ustinov, omar sharif, rex harrison and william holden; more than enough names to get bums on cinema seats. every taste in hero is catered for. though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed.<br /><br />their talents are simply thrown away, and i wonder that stars with so much money and such reputation can be yet so desperate or lacking in good sense. this sort of movie hardly adds gilding to a cv. sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way round.<br /><br />it was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset. that ludicrously mismatched jaunty-jazz theme music, which also percolated up every time some incidental noise is needed, had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator muzak. who imagined employing a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy jungles of central africa, or the endless sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop? definitely a serious goof-ball. ennio morricone would have known what to do; and his results would have oozed enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating a good two points. this director should have taken the trouble to watch 'lawrence of arabia', or even sergio leone's westerns; he might have learnt a few things. but then again, probably he wouldn't.<br /><br />alfred hitchcock played the disappearing wife theme to good effect in his film 'frantic'. it was later remade with equal panache staring harrison ford. in each case the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible. here, when michael caine might be otherwise compelled to employ a little brain and bravado, rex harrison kept popping-up out of no-where like some wily old genii, to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled. <br /><br />at least the photography was rather good, with excellent use of the often beautiful environment. but then the dumb music must pipe-up and blow to atoms what little ambiance this created.<br /><br />action scenes were also contrived and stilted, with such ineptly choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a first-year drama class. and, of course, the players must fight to a jazz accompaniment - as you do.<br /><br />and that's about as much comment as this item deserves. except to say that the script was pretty wretched as well.<br /><br />stick with your hobby on this one. even if it contained your favourite movie-stars, you're sure to be disappointed too.
