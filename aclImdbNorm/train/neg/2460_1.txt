i really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. it's basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. it consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project, and that's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at. there is no subtlety and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary. and while the lines aren't funny in the first place, an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly, anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.<br /><br />i'd recommend this to people who like "comedies" in the vein of "big momma's house" or "norbit"; people who think that words like "butt" are inherently hysterically funny. other people should stay away and not waste their time.
