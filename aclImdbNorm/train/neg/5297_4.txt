it really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there. this is by far not one of the worst out there, still not a good movie, but not the worst nonetheless. go see something like death nurse or blood lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the night brings charlie is the worst. the film has decent camera work and editing, which is way more than i can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films.<br /><br />the film doesn't deliver on the on-screen deaths, there's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. but the lack of on-screen graphic violence doesn't mean this isn't a slasher film, just a bad one.<br /><br />the film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. the film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements, done in a tongue in cheek way. for example, after a kill, charlie goes to the town's 'welcome' sign and marks the population down one less. this is something that can only get a laugh.<br /><br />if you're into slasher films, definitely give this film a watch. it is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers, but not by much. the comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious. you may forget the movie, you may remember it. i'll remember it because i love the name.
