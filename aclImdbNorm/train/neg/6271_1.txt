there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is. it simply defies description. something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. the whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning. there's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! i'm not making this stuff up. the computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.<br /><br />the "film" is total trash. surreal bad trash. spectacularly, one-of-a-kind bad trash. there's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which aren't very hot or erotic. there's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula, which had me rolling on the floor.<br /><br />definitely one of the worst movies ever made. up there with the equally wretched direct-to-home video boardinghouse, or boogeyman ii (both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). at least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on.
