a spoiler.<br /><br />what three words can guarantee you a terrible film? cheap canadian production. the brain fits those words perfectly. terrible script, idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every bad movie fan. the horror is hilarious. the post production team looks like it gave up. what makes the brain admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke?<br /><br />it's around christmas time. a mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. the day later, a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />if a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? what begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when the brain tries to be serious. a child cannot be frightened by the scary moments. the brain is too funny a concept to try and be gritty. the psychological research institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting i have seen. viewer discretion advised heavily.
