it happened with assault on prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with the lost boys in 2008 and now it's happened with another classic from the 80's wargames... :( why, oh why, oh why won't hollywood ever learn? leave them alone...! they can't be remade...! they suck....! we all hate them....!.<br /><br />those of you who haven't seen the original 1983 version with matthew broderick & ally sheedy, go rent/buy it now....!! the hardware may look dated, the special effects are not new millennium but it still beats this rubbish hands down....<br /><br />for those of us who lived through the 80's when hacking was sexy, the internet was something mysterious and your disks came as a 8" floppy variety, well we now possess the wisdom to avoid this film like a thermonuclear war! <br /><br />never before has "a nice game of chess" seemed the better option....
