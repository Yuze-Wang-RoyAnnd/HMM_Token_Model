a man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50's and that he now has the power to... burst into flames! <br /><br />i was really geared up for this film, what with being directed by the great toby hooper and staring wild card brad dourif. unfortunately it didn't rise above the average individual-with-violent-powers movie. spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much. the special effects aren't bad though and help to carry the movie to the finale.<br /><br />the cast isn't bad, dourif does steal the show.<br /><br />all around, no classic but it's not the worst of its kind either.<br /><br />** out of ****
