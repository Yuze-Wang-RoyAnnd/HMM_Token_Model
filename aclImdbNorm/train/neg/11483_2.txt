i was fully amped up to see this film. i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand. i shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt clark's worst film there is so much wrong with this film. first off, some of the acting is great, in particular nick stahl as 'the bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (i can't recall her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially leo fitzpatrick. he's a veteran of clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'kids', but in 'bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. the screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. no sorry, a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. and i couldn't fathom clark's intentions. was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence? it sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv. i'm no prude but i didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. i still maintain that clark's best film is 'another day in paradise'. it's fantastic and i don't think he'll ever top it.
