i almost drowned in cheese watching this movie. in fact i could not even finish it. i want my money back. one more of hollywood's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea. good thing i keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. just in case. they should of gave nic cage a hat and a bull-whip. swashbucklin'. cage's performance in raising arizona or leaving las vegas beats this "lemon". people who are completely and totally marketed(and most of them are) should love this movie. if this film had been animated, i would have taken it more seriously. i would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. in my opinion, this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that fact.<br /><br />all the sheep seem to love it though.
