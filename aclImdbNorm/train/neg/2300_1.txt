"the 700 club" has to be the single most bigoted television program in the history of television itself. to make matters worse, it's been on the air since 1966, implying that thousands if not millions of people are buying into its hate and lies. headed by pat robertson, the unscrupulous, megalomaniacal founder and leader of the christian coalition, "the 700 club" takes us from misinformation to misunderstanding, broadcasting "news" as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the world's problems are to blame on homosexuals, wiccans, new age spiritualists, muslims, jews, hindus, non-fundamentalist christians, democrats, single mothers, foreigners, feminists, evolutionists, environmentalists, nasa scientists, and anyone else who doesn't share their fanatical religious views. it's actually the best fake news since "the daily show" or the "weekend update" segment of "saturday night live," or since "fox news," for that matter. of course, pat's always the one who makes each of the decisions, saying whatever comes to mind and not giving a damn who it offends or hurts. in the meantime, he continues his part in the struggle to transform the united states into a militarized police state by having the religious wrong stick their noses in everything they can and asking for one donation after another - no less than a measly $100 to become a member, by the way - to fund pat's african diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment. no, never mind that pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of zaire and zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth; it's all for the greater glory of god, don't you know? and of course, the hosts of "the 700 club" are always willing to read letters "written by viewers" as they like to put it, coincidentally each typed in the same format and all on the same color of paper by "viewers" supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts (they claim to have "words of knowledge" come to them) but who never appear on the program to say what happened to them. honestly, how can anyone take a show seriously when they're using a poor applause recording? it should make people wonder why there's no studio audience.<br /><br />the sad thing that pat's cronies and viewers don't realize or just don't want to realize are the horrible things he's done and said. this is a guy who agreed with jerry falwell that the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states were the result of god punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism. ironic, considering that pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon in the state department; i have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements. his rants against homosexuals, single mothers, and any number of sexual practices he considers "sinful" are interesting, considering he was known to frequent a number of brothels during the korean war. as the bible says, be fruitful and multiply, so congratulations, pat - thanks to you, there's probably a number of children born to single korean mothers. then, of course, there was the time he called for the assassination of venezuelan president hugo chavez (not that he's a saint, but still). oh, yes, and let's not soon forget the time this "crusader for human life" supported forced abortions in china. very "christian" of him, wouldn't you say?<br /><br />and just in case pat has forgotten, i haven't forgotten his little speech that evangelical christians today are "being treated exactly as the jews were in nazi germany." honestly, to compare his "plight" to the horrors of the holocaust is almost unforgivable. speaking of which, need i mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals? of course, history shows us that the nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward jews. pat robertson is one of the biggest liars in history. if he was pinocchio, his nose would encircle the earth.<br /><br />unfortunately, more and more people continue to believe him every day. this is your wake-up call, people; "the 700 club" is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history. it's evil masquerading as good; it's a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing. it's bigoted filth that tries to look clean, pretty, and loving. it's living proof that hateful, dangerous religious views aren't confined to certain groups in the middle east. even those who are not of the christian faith know that it goes against everything jesus taught, and if jesus was to appear to this "club," he wouldn't be emulating them. instead, he'd be chastising them as he did the pharisees of his time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as he did in front of the synagogue in his time. all i can say is thank god that pat had no chance of becoming president; if he did, he'd be the harbinger of armageddon - and not on the side of the good guys.
