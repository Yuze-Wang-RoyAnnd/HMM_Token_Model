wwf survivor series 2001<br /><br />this was among the worst events of 2001. perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it didn't follow suit to most of the previous survivor series'. there was only one survivor series match. and that survivor series match went on for 45 minutes. what's more, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with the rock versus austin and the rock prevailing for his team. and don't get me started on the preview before the event. no matter who won it was obvious that no one was going to f***ing die. there was no need for all of that pointless hype. whatever the storyline, it was just a wrestling event.<br /><br />and as for the rest of the matches: the first match was christian defending his european title against al snow. it was a good fast paced match and its good to see a heel winning a match fairly. william regal versus tajiri was boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before. edge versus test was good but nothing great. the tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening. the battle royal went on for 10 minutes and no one really cared who'd win in the first place. the women's title match wasn't great. no, not in the slightest. the main event must have been the most hypocritical match in history. the alliance lost but guess what, after 5 months every single alliance superstar returned. the match itself was poor. the rock eliminated 3 of them and jericho eliminated 2. the rock was too caught up with his acting to be there when the invasion began. jericho was the one that jeopardised the whole match. if i wanted any 2 to be eliminated in the early going it would be them. everyone knew that kane, big show and undertaker were just fall guys. 7 matches isn't enough for a survivor series. if there's ever a survivor series as bad as this again i'll
