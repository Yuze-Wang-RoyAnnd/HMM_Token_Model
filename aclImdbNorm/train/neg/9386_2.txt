in the many films i have seen warren oates, i have come to a definite conclusion, here is one talented individual. i first saw mr. oates back in the 1960's television series called stoney burke. from then on, i followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles. that happened in 1974, when sam peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called 'bring me the head of alfredo garcia.' of course, his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in 'the wild bunch'. i have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic, that is until i saw him in this flop. the movie is called " chandler ", a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the 1950's created by raymond chandler. because, the synopsis said it was about a hard nose private eye, i was immediately interested. however, i sat patiently through the entire film and found it to be a dull, dis-interesting, slow pace, twisted, confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self. collectively and with some of hollywood's best supporting stars, such as alex dreier, mitch ryan, gordon pinsent, charles mcgraw, richard loo and scatman crothers, this movie had enough power to reach mach five, however, it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where. as a result, one of my favorite actor's got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground. **
