this movie was absolute torture. first of all, it's a whopping 4+ hours long! true, the kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for, but every single one of those battles need not have been shown. so maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial film as advertised. sure didn't seem like it, as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws. the battle sequences were so poorly executed. i am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in border. each battle was the exact same as the previous. it was so predictable. (this might be a spoiler.) the whole army marches uphill, five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each (they also use the same cussword every time), one of the lead actors is shot, someone yells for a stretcher, the actor says, "no, don't get a stretcher. that will take 6 men from the battalion," and then an actor dies. that exact same thing happens over and over and over again. oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. the cast of the movie is too big for its own good. despite such a long movie, none of the characters were well developed. the actresses had the most miniscule roles. they all are dressed and portrayed to be the same. two of them were weeping synchronized. it was so comical. they moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together.<br /><br />the list just goes on and on. i know i'm still forgetting something . anyways, i think i have bashed the film enough that you get the picture.
