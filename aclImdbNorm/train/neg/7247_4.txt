in a nutshell: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants and tries to be something more. it wants to be harold and maude, annie hall, the graduate. it wants to be deep and human. it has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feel of an important movie. the dialog is smart -- at times. there are some "laugh out loud" moments.<br /><br />but here's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late-night-cable, in-flight, time-killer: <br /><br />1. david schwimmer -- how many times can joe sad-sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying? maybe some drool would have helped.<br /><br />2. gwenneth paltrow -- she's really flat here and not just in the chest. her role is supposed to be this lively, nice, caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad-sack loser like schwimmer has any chance with her. but gwenneth plays her very dull. combine this with puppy-dog drool-face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about.<br /><br />(i kept picturing someone else in this role -- kate hudson for example.) <br /><br />3. the script and the plot -- the stuff that happens just basically doesn't ring true; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said "oops, time to wrap it up, got a train to catch!" so they pulled out the hollywood formula book, checked off all the boxes, and went home.
