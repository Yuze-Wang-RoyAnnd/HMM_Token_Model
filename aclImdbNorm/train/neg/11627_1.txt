i wonder who was responsible for this mess. the jokes wouldn't have worked for gilligan's island. if this had gone to series, would there have been jokes about auschwitz, or would eva have to replace her oven, only to have adolf suggest the kind that seats 50?? another post compared this show to i love lucy. the problem with this is that lucille ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations, and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence. <br /><br />after the damage the nazi's did to england and the number of people they killed, i would think the very concept of a comedy about hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced.
