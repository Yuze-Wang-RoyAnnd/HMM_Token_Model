i realise that the us army was demoralised by 1971, but this film was unbelievable. it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishment battalion in a sven hassell novel. the writer must be a real army hater. the psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell, and the useless black top sergeant should have been sacked as well. these men were going overseas, the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from, and an investigation would have ensued. the scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one. farrell, the alleged barrack room lawyer, would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order ( to torture pows in contravention to the geneva convention ), actual assault on an enlisted man, sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer. intead he just walks away. after this, discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable. i don't know how it ended, i went to bed.
