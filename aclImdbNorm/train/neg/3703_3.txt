i did not expect much from this film, but boy-o-boy, i did not expect the movie to be this bad. chris rock is not showing a good act here, you can't get the feeling that his caracter is real, i think the movie would have been a bit better if it's drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more/better humor was involved. the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it. in the "making of" they don't show a single smile. this is a very bad film! i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me, but i did never laugh!
