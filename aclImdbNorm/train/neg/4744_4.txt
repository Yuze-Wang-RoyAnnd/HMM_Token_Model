worst dcom i have seen. ever. well, maybe not as bad as smart house. this was just bad. the acting and story was fine, but the effects sucked!<br /><br />they were so fake! the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen. that was probably the only scene in which i was excited.<br /><br />overall, i found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly. <br /><br />i will give it a four for brenda song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene.<br /><br />4/10
