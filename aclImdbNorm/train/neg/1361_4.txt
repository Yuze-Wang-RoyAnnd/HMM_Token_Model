i was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people - maggie smith, a very young bob newhart and, of course, peter ustinov. my disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film doesn't work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film. ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large american corporation based in london. bluffing his way past dimwitted ceo karl malden and tech geek newhart, ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the 'perfect heist' part of the film. to do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe. and here is problem one. his perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid. his lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras. the second problem is the heist (fraud really) happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension. maggie smith is sadly miscast as ustinov's ditsy next door neighbor/secretary who just can't keep a job. i love maggie smith but she just seems too together here, too composed, the part called for more of a wacky, physical comedian. furthermore, ustinov and smith have no chemistry together, maybe it's the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, as devoid of actual romance as it is, still comes off a little creepy. ustinov co-wrote the script, and it was thought well of at the time, but i found it unfunny, meandering and a sad waste of a great cast.
