i saw this bomb when it hit theaters. i laughed the whole time. why? because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane. i look back on it and realize there was not one funny thing in the whole movie. at leat nothing intentional. it is awfully funny that lizzie cn chew a piece of nurplex and become a gigantic, carnivorous demon...yet her itty-bitty little dress is perfectly intact, despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than she was when she first put it on. or the kind of movie in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and only fall unconcious, and return to conciousness without any medical attention. and don't let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the "villain" that they decided they needed to create "conflict." uh huh.<br /><br />to the person complaining about disney only targetting kids-the raunchy parts of this film seems to disprove that statement. do we really need daryl hannah accusing jeff bridges of having kinky video tapes? you do if you're disney and you're out of ideas for making the movie appeal to the above-8 crowd without writing a more intelligent script! i am thoroughly convinced that disney pays off the ratings board so it's movies can get away with murder and still get family-friendly ratings.<br /><br />what a waste of the dvd format.
