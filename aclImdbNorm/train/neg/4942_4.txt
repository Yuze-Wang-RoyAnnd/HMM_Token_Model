every new fall line-up show deserves, at least, my "3 strikes and you're out" policy. i give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh, that is, 3 complete episodes. after episode 1, i actually said to the tv,"cancelled tomorrow". it was that bad. i have now watched the first 4 episodes of "cavemen" and have yet to manage even a smirk. not a titter, a guffaw, a chortle, as a matter of fact, no facial movement at all. i will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because i am convinced that i am clearly missing something in this show. i'm simply not "getting" it, but i believe that a comedy on a major tv network in prime-time, just has to be funny; but there are no laughs from me yet. there's just no way that abc would put on the least funniest comedy of all time at 8:00 p.m. i know there has got to be an inside joke that just isn't jiving with my brain. i've read each of the previous comments, i "get" the social aspect of it, but, where are the jokes ???? i shall continue suffering for at least 30 minutes a week, until i have a light-bulb moment and smack myself in the head shouting "eureka".
