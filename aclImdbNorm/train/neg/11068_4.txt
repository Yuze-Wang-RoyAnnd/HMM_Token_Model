dahmer, a young confused man. dahmer, a confusing movie. granted, i had a few beers while watching the movie, but that doesn't explain why i got so bored by this flick.<br /><br />its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying, and there's no real storyline with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie. the inbetween stuff, which would be the movie, is just boring images and a waste of time. <br /><br />we never see actual murders, everything is just a bunch of insinuations. sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer's dreaming the entire thing, but you know he isn't, since it's<br /><br />based on a true story and this actually happened, at least most of it. but what happened? it's not easy to tell.<br /><br />i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie. i<br /><br />didn't like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended. <br /><br />*/*****
