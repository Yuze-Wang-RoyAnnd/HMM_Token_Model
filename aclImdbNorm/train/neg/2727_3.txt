this oddity in the new doris day collection doesn't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. what she does do however, is shine when she's on screen. the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day. jancie rule shows promise and it's a shame she didn't become a big star. ruth roman handles the role of the "go-getter" with aplomb. better if this was in color. the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well. what's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes. if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen you'll like this one.
