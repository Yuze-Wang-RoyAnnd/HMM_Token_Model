really? really???? i know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage. horrible in every sense. terribly inaccurate in so many ways. i have an easier time believing the president of the united states suiting up, flying a jet fighter, and shooting down aliens. it is easier to note the few things that were right. my jaw dropped when i saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. it was overacted, seemingly pointless plot diversions, and had questionable cinematography at times.<br /><br />x-box, youtube, acupat utilities
