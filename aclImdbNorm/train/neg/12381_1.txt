this film is really vile. it plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s and puts it into a school context. i'm not saying that urban crime wasn't a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren't/aren't problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit. violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it's not a case of social issues but a white, upper-middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol. and of course he knows how to play the system. does that sound familiar. yes. this turd is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty piece of work. it's disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment. this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator, death wish 2-5 and so on and so on. the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this.
