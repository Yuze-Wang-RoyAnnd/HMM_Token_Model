when will the hurting stop? i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again. they keep on making movies with the same story, falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest, but sadly fail to do so, as this is not a good story. moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy-thinking. as if people learn. the numerous different versions of this film prove that we don't.
