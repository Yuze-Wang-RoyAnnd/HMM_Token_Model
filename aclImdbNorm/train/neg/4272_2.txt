these kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive person in order to take over their life. fatal attraction, pacific heights, the hand that rocks the cradle, single white female, and a thousand made-for-tv movies are some examples of this. but while a few, especially fatal attraction and pacific heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters or a few plot twists, unlawful entry plays everything by the book. and were it not for the notoriety of its stars (kurt russel, ray liota, and madeline stowe), this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a danielle steele miniseries.<br /><br />russel plays michael carr, an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (madeline stowe). unfortunately, he quietly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop (ray liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for his power. at first empathizing with carr (probably only pretending to do so), the cop befriends the couple. but soon enough, the cops wants carr out of the way so, destroying the guys life nearly any way he can (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who has installed the guy's security system in his house) in order to take over and presumably, get his wife. it seems less ends-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to prove his power. the wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an end. and the story plays out entirely by the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. from the "shocking" moment our main, naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-he's-not-really-dead finale.
