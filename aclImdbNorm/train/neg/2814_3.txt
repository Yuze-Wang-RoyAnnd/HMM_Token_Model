1st watched 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10(dir-tobe hooper): scary, yet sadistic(which makes sense) portrayal of a relative of the marquis de sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did. this tobe hooper film really doesn't do a whole lot different than his similar in style freddy krueger movies with the same star (freddy himself - robert englund) playing a dual role(the marquis de sade and his relative). it is also seems like it wants to really poke at christianity but then loses that in the end much to my chagrin but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie. could have been much worse if excesses were taken in sex and violence, but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes. my final thought is why would hooper want to make this movie. it obviously took awhile to actually get distributed, then it has to be advertised gruesomely and with hooper's name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore. it's obvious this didn't work.
