the goofy griswalds win the t.v. game show "pig in a poke" grand prize, and all fly off together to europe where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another. of all the ridiculous, unfunny money-spinning sequels this one beats the lot. harold ramis' 1983 film was a below average misadventure in which the misfit family went on a nightmarish "vacation" across the states. this time amy heckerling ("look who's talking") helms what turns out to be a disastrous "comedy" which will annoy you more than it will make you laugh.<br /><br />hughes script (with rob klane) is awful and you wonder why the likes of chevy chase and beverly d'angelo bothered with such a dead-beat project, as even anthony michael hall and imogene coca had the sense to decline the offer. even an omnipotent michael palin is unable to lift proceedings to any level that one could call entertaining.<br /><br />yet, as inconceivable as it may seem, "european vacation" was successful enough to warrant a second sequel! surely it couldn't be as unbearable as this one. you know, i have yet to see a national lampoon show that was worth the bother.<br /><br />monday, december 26, 1994 - t.v.
