first off, let me say that i am a great believer in fanpro stuff. i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled. star trek voyages and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts. so i have a soft-spot for fanpro stuff that means i'll overlook things that i would ordinarily slate badly.<br /><br />so on to st: hf. well, first off the good things. enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and, for the most part, the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles. next, the effects aren't bad for a home-brew effort, with nothing to make you really wince. the stories aren't too bad either. nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story-arcs.<br /><br />but it has a lot of faults.<br /><br />first off, although they quite obviously have to rip-off star trek footage, set backdrops, music and effects, i see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other sci-fi musical score ever made. everything from aliens to starship troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another. likewise, much of the footage is from other movies, dutifully cgi'd over to make it look different. the grey warships, for instance, though disguised, are quite obviously star destroyers from star wars. and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station ticonderoga from starship troopers. likewise, sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters, as does animated over footage. in one scene in either first or second season, i think, you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle, which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favours.<br /><br />acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch. everyone does improve as the seasons progress, though, but expect to grimace at the screen a lot, especially in the early seasons. they've also made some interesting acting choices. let's just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to "cake" and leave it at that.<br /><br />make-up effects are generally quite effective on the whole. but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap ferengi and cardassian masks for anything other than background use or "passing" shots. they are just beyond unrealistic. every time i saw one of these (apart from trying not to laugh too much) i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that "this is a stick-up!" in one scene a "cardassian" actually talks whilst wearing one of these. not only do the lips not move, but the mask doesn't even have an opening where the mouth should be. someone needs to be slapped hard for that. couldn't they have taken a craft knife to it, for goodness' sake! there are also some well-done, but unintentionally funny make-up jobs, such as the herman munster look alike.<br /><br />the writing, though coherent, is nothing new. instead the script runs like a continuation of ds9, with the ships heading out from ds12 on various missions. the new enemy, "the grey" aren't very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the borg threads. i.e. starfleet meet the grey, the grey are hugely powerful, starfleet barely escape with their lives, then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc. all done before with the borg.<br /><br />another bone of contention is the dialogue. star trek writers have long had the ability to write "insert technobabble here" into a script. it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using "quantum phase discriminators" or "isolytic charges" etc. in other words, nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand.<br /><br />the words are just gibberish really. i've no problem with this, but where st:hf makes a mess of it is where they include real-world comments into this concept.<br /><br />tactical advice such as "we need to regroup" sounds good, but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group. likewise when asked what the situation is, a tactical officer is heard to reply "we count three battleships". he actually needed to count them? c'mon! i expected the questioner to ask him "are you sure?" or "can you double check". but my all-time favourite comment is this: <br /><br />captain: "can we establish two-way communication?"<br /><br />comms officer: "no, we can only send and receive.."<br /><br />well, duh!.....<br /><br />having said all the above, the show does improve as it goes along. seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 shows an improvement but 4 & 5 are where it starts to get noticeably better. season 6 so far looks quite reasonable.<br /><br />i do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though. quicktime sucks, quite frankly and the sooner they move to divx/avi format the better. some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny qt window on a computer monitor. not only does quicktime make this difficult, but the 320x180 resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well. in fact, it makes the shows pretty unwatchable, like they were a tenth-generation vhs tape copy. the least they could do was to include a hi-res downloadable option.<br /><br />anyway, the show has promise, and i'm even beginning to like some of the characters. but that's 40 episodes on, so i'm not sure this says that much about character development at all.<br /><br />but what can you say, it's free....<br /><br />ps: out of 28 votes, 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10. hmmmm... were we watching the same show? or are you 19 all three year olds?
