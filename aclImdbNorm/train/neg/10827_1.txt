this ambitious film suffers most from writer/director paul thomas anderson's delusions of grandeur. highly derivative of much better material (altman's "nashville," lumet's "network"), this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere. a couple of misguided detours along the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) don't help matters. neither does the uneven level of performances. especially bad: william h. macy, whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether; julianne moore, for her unconvincing angst. and how many times must we see john c. reilly's sad sack shtick ("chicago" and "the hours" will suffice)? tom cruise comes off well by comparison
