when i was younger, i liked this show, but now...blecch!!! this show is sappy, badly written, and rarely funny. the three leads were all good actors and funny men (saget's stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with, as was coulier a better stand up, and stamos was a better than average actor). after a while, stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff (who could blame him?). the show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money.<br /><br />here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show:<br /><br />1. the catch phrases- how many times can one person put up with tiring catch phrases like with 'how rude', 'you got it dude', 'nerdbomber', 'cut it out' and 'have mercy' in a 24 hour time period? <br /><br />2. kimmy gibler- the most annoying character ever written for television.<br /><br />3. the writing- stale and cliched as an oreo cookie. there is good cliched writing and bad cliched writing. full house had bad cliched writing.<br /><br />4. three men living together in san francisco- enough said.<br /><br />5. unrealistic stuff- too much to recall.<br /><br />6. trendy kids- the girls had all the latest mall fashions and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into.<br /><br />now this show is on nick @ nite. i would hardly call it a classic. i have nothing bad to say about the people involved since i think many of them are talented in their own right. but this show was just so sugary sweet, i couldn't stand it after a while.
