this was in short a terrible disappointment. by far the worst adaptation of one of my favourite novels. the dialogue was horribly clumsy; i could sense no feeling behind the words expressed by the characters. the lines were delivered too hastily and felt rather out of place. they could just as well have been cited by statues. the chemistry between george c. scott and susannah york was non-existent and watching an american rochester felt strange. he could have at least tried to do a british accent. i like george c. scott as an actor, but this simply did not work. i felt like i was watching highlights from jane eyre, where the main pieces of the story had been randomly put together with no regard to the flow of the story. the scenery and music were all very nice, but i could feel none of the passion and love that is supposed to be between jane and rochester and the movie left me totally unmoved.<br /><br />if you want to see a good version of jane eyre i suggest you watch the 1983 bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke or the 1997 version with ciar'an hinds and samantha morton. now these two are brilliant adaptations.
