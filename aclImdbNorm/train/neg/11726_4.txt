wesley snipes is james dial, an assassin for hire, agent of the cia and pure bad-ass special operative. during his free time dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as beauty.<br /><br />enter agent collins, his supervising officer. enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in uk custody. of course the united kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head-shots outside of courtrooms.<br /><br />the assassination is a big success apart from the fact, that the escape plan blew. so dial's partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police, whilst dial becomes hot property with the london coppers trying to get to him and cia trying to dispose of him.<br /><br />fortunately for dial the safe-house is routinely visited by a teenager emily day (eliza bennett), who loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil uk law enforcement...<br /><br />with a script like that need i say more? on the plus side wesley snipes is wesley snipes (be that a pro or a con) and the movie is quite engaging. on the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach.
