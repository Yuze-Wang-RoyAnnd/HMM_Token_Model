back in the 1970s, wpix ran "the adventures of superman" every weekday afternoon for quite a few years. every once in a while, we'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air "superman and the mole men." i always looked forward to those days. watching it recently, i was surprised at just how bad it really was.<br /><br />it wasn't bad because of the special effects, or lack thereof. true, george reeves' superman costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible. and true, the mole men's costumes were even worse. what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn't have fooled a ten year-old, since the zippers, sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious. but these were forgivable shortcomings.<br /><br />no, what made it bad were the contrived plot devices. time and again, superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating. a lynch mob is searching for the creatures? rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself, he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man. the creatures are cornered? again, he stands around watching and talking but doesn't save them until they're shot. luke benson, the town's rabble-rouser, shoots at him? attempted murder to any reasonable person, but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems. superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud, but never once took advantage of them.<br /><br />that said, both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well, seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles. if only they had been given a better script to work with.
