this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of "they saved hitler's brain" the worst movie i have ever seen period. when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and sctv and therefore was anticipating what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the tv improv shows must deal with. <br /><br />the writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness, some flatulence jokes, some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy. the game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on let's make a deal with stupid grossness. the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor. the stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for seasame street. the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness. the french chef walking around blind constantly uttering "there is no difference" with a french accent was, well you get my point.<br /><br />the only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute. this means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. oh yea i've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970's and you will like this movie if you are high. well most of the country was not stoned in the 70's. if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine. there were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie. of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was.
