a still famous but decadent actor (morgan freeman) has not filmed for four years. when he is invited to participate in a new project, he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor latin neighborhood in carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket. he sees the gorgeous spanish cashier scarlet (paz vega) and he becomes attracted with her ability. his driver never returns to catch him and scarlet gives a ride to the actor. but first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared; then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time.<br /><br />i am a big fan of morgan freeman and paz vega. however, the pointless "10 items or less" is absolutely disappointing. this low-budget movie does not seem to have a storyline, and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of morgan freeman and paz vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes. the ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with the character of morgan freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again. was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family? or was a clash of classes, and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes? my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "um astro em minha vida" ("a star in my life")
