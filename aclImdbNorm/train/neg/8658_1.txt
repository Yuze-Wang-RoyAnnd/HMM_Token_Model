a large part of the scenes should be cut off. there is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off. for example the scene where the hunters mentions "i got spiders on my dick", "i like dick", playing in the mud scene, or a bar scene where a professional dinocroc hunters main job is a snake charmer.<br /><br />how about other terribly incoherent scenes featuring a woman, diane who wants to loose her virginity to a boyfriend who walks like he wears women's panties three sizes too small. while they make love, didn't they realized they are making it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and loose his head? why did they do in a living room? i mean his head really flipped. how about the beach scene very reminiscent of steven spielberg's jaws scene at grant lake. all these strange scene could easily be re-dubbed and billed as a comedy.<br /><br />here in my local town, the cineplex theaters had been advertising for months about dinocroc, and i am glad i didn't watch it because i later found out it was shown only for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. the movie was that bad. i suspected that dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview. it features the leg of dinocroc that looks like a child wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down like a 2 year old. it could easily passed over as baby geniuses.<br /><br />if any students of movie making wants to learn what not to do this is a real classic trash. such as diane's boyfriend who walks like he had an advanced case of syphilis makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before he get to drink beer. when this happens, who cares about dinocroc? the panties man looked more more interesting than the entire movie of dinocroc. his acting was so bad, he makes a much better replacement for mr. bean. move over rowan atkinson, here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci-fi flick. perhaps the worse casting in the history of hollywood.
