with an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this might have been a classic. instead it is a repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the jfk assassination grafted, rather pointlessly, on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president kegan in 1960. many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do - sterling hayden or eli wallach, for instance, or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top - john huston. jeff bridges and anthony perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well, in their very different ways, though.<br /><br />the photography is gorgeous, but does not justify an hour and a half of your life, or the price of the dvd purchase.
