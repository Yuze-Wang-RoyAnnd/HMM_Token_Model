before i'd seen this, i had seen some pretty bad christmas films. but once i saw this, "jingle all the way" looked better than "the godfather". "santa claus" is a jolly film about santa helping out some kids, but it almost feels demonic watching it. santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is replaces by an evil, devilish laugh that i'm sure has turned many kids off of christmas. the plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits along with all of the performances and dialog. santa lives high above earth in the north pole where he, and kids from all around the world get ready for christmas. but santa has an enemy named pitch, or satan. pitch tries to ruin santa's christmas by making three boys naughty, and by creating diversions, like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot. when pitch causes santa to be attacked by a dog, it's up to santa's helper pedro and merlin the wizard to get santa out of this pickle. <br /><br />everything about this film, along with being downright bad, is so bizarre. satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than santa. santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls, yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in mexico. the reindeer are wind up toys, and when the reindeer laughs, i'm amazed it doesn't bring tears to kid's eyes...it's frightening. everything is terrible. the first 10 minutes are simply santa playing the organ while kids sing to it. probably one of the strangest scenes is santa shooting pitch in the butt with a mini-cannon and uproariously laughing about it while pitch dances around in pain. i think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from, than showing them this. the only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema.<br /><br />my rating: bomb/****. 85 mins.
