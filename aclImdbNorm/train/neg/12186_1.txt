this remake of the 1962 orginal film'o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors - however scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch.<br /><br />deniro is a superb actor, dedicated to giving his all in the work he does, however he needs direction to focus his talent, and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film.<br /><br />gregory peck's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst robert michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as this.<br /><br />nick nolte turns in a better performance than lorenzo's oil but is not on the same form as "weeds". joe don baker has some great lines while juliette lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation.<br /><br />some good points? the start credits(!), the first view of cody's back when doing dips in the prison, the scene where cody is attacked with baseball bats, sam bowden's decent into full-fledged panic, cody's outwardly calm but unnerving prescence.<br /><br />the worst? the "cleaning woman - but not really!!!" part. clinging bare-handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (are there no speed bumps in the us?) the "he's dead - but not really!!!" parts and the aforementioned rambling ending.<br /><br />i may watch the original again, but i've yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it.
