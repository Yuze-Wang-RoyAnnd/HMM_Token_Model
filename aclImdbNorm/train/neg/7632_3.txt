many people see this as a classic, but i obviously must have missed something. life in anarene, texas in the early 50's is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in anarene, texas in the early 50's will be pretty dull too! what is it that so many people see in this? once the last picture show in anarene closes there really won't be anything to do in town. duane (jeff bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. but even before it closes there isn't much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. high school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town. you see, there's not much for them to do either - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers) or to whine about the local high school football team. three times something happened that i thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie. sam (ben johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens because of that, sonny (timothy bottoms) and jacy (cybill shepherd) elope, but nothing really happens because of that, joe bob (barc doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens because of that. the only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of billy (sam bottoms) which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast.<br /><br />peter bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is intended i suppose to point out how grey this town is, but the only thing i found interesting was the early look at actors like bottoms, shepherd, bridges and randy quaid. (as an aside it was terrifying to see how much quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation movies.) classic? i don't think so! 3/10
