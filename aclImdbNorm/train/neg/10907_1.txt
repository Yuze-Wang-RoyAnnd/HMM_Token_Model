i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow, which i enjoyed. however, this dud seemed to last forever. it's one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg-13 while not being kid appropriate. the jokes aren't just low-brow or f**t jokes, they're crude, lewd, and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency. many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg-13 rating...too bad...it might have made a bigger splash as an r-rated film if the funny was left in. (overstatement? probably.) i do not recommend this movie. it is a full-on waste of time...and i'm a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot. at 45 minutes in, the movie felt like it should be winding down...and boy were we ready for it to. the ending is quaint but doesn't salvage the rest of this quagmire/tourist trap of a rental. 1/2 star (glad i saw it as a freebie...would have been sickened to pay hard-earned greenbacks for this tripe)
