nobody, but nobody, could chew the scenery like the divine one, ruth elizabeth davis, and "elizabeth and essex" is a great example why. although she overplays the part at times, watch her when she gawfs about raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladies-in-waiting are about to play: in that one moment, she makes us understand how elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely! at other times, she is done in by the script's sappiness. when elizabeth has to be vulnerable, she comes off as weak and shrewish. this has the added effect of undermining her authority: when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice, it's hard to take her seriously.<br /><br />flynn exudes charm, making us see how essex was able to worm his way into elizabeth's heart, but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man. it also doesn't help that essex is badly underwritten. why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his queen - even as he swears fidelity to her - except only that he is more blue-blooded, thus, more "worthy" of rule? and why does raliegh betray elizabeth by intercepting her and essex's letters? he's in no risk of falling out of favor, and we know where essex (and his head) is headed. so why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable?<br /><br />what did curtiz do with all the $$$ he was given? he doesn't even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage. he should've ended it with elizabeth the first time alone at the tower; everything else that follows (especially the final scene between her and essex) is unnecessary. the costumes are fantastic. and is it me, or does bette look exactly like susan sarandon?
