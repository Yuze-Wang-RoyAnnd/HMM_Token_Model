in this movie, the old amitabh bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. he meets her in his restaurant. the younger woman, tabu, flirts with him. he does not know what to do and asks her out. her reaction on his invitation is rather weird. is was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />and that annoys me about this whole movie. it wasn't that funny. the jokes and script was terrible! the only jokes i liked was about the teeth of a waiter, but after a several times, even that began to bore.<br /><br />amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. this was a weird relationship! a little girl with the mind of an old woman! it was frightening! i know someone can be attached to a kid, but this man has adult conversations with this child. it did not make any sense.<br /><br />tabu's father is paresh rawal. he has to give amitabh a hard time, but we all know paresh, he can't do that. so even the conversation at the end, when they sit all around the table, even that was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />i only like movies who really are funny. i suppose i will never watch this movie again.
