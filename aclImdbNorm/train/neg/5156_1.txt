"laughter is a state of mind" says the tag, and i hesitate to comment on barry levinson's. what could he have been thinking during the making of "toys"? when he watched the rushes, did he see a successful, funny fantasy? if so, then he's working on a different plane than i. this is an excruciating picture, one in which the production design is 90% of the thing (and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment). robin williams and (most especially) joan cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies. there's nothing remotely funny (satirical or slapstick-wise) on display here. it is uniformly draggy, ugly, and one of the very worst "big" movies ever made. no stars from ****
