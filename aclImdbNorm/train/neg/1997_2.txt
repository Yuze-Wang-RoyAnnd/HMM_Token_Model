this version is likely available at your local dollar store on dvd. the print is not great, nor is the sound, but if you have $1.00 and 90 or so minutes to spare, you'll get your money's worth (which is not saying an awful lot). anna neagle is extremely vapid as nanette. whatever her charms may have been back in the day, they are not evident in this film. a great number of fine character actors appear in this film (helen broderick, zasu pitts, even arden), but the material falls remarkably short of their talents. still, it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing. the musical numbers (there are really only two) are quite horrible. clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original "no, no, nanette". for what it's worth, the dvd can be had for $1.00. it's worth that much just to say you've seen it.
