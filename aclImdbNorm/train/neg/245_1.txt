beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting.<br /><br />the opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.<br /><br />and aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time. pure genius.<br /><br />the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that i've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. perhaps i own the only copy in existence.<br /><br />
