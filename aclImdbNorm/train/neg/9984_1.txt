it was a sunday night and i was waiting for the advertised movie on tv. they said it was a comedy! the movie started, 10 minutes passed, after that 30 minutes and i didn't laugh not even once. the fact is that the movie ended and i didn't get even on echance to laugh. please, someone tickle me, i lost 90 minutes for nothing.
