i saw this film at the ny gay & lesbian film festival and thought it was pretty bad. first and most distracting was the way much of it was shot; that is, a lot of slow motion and overly arty close-ups that seemed to have no point--story wise or aesthetically--other than to show the skills of the cinematographer (who i believe was also the director). this film seemed what a pretentious film student would come up with. the lead actor (sam levine) was certainly very cute, but was a mediocre actor at best; and the rest of the cast ranged from so-so, to bad. the story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. i do have to concede that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film; laughing and sighing constantly, but i disliked it a great deal.
