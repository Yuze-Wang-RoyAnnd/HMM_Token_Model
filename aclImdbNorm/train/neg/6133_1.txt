kurt thomas stars as jonathan cabot some kind of a gymnast who trains for a special game which involves being hunted by a group of ninjas, but those ninjas won't stand a chance, especially since cabot is a gymnast! taken as a whole gymkata is one helluva bad movie, the atrocious acting, the god-awful script and really incompetent directing make the quality below human standards, however this movie is so terrible it becomes really, really funny. i mean with dialog such as "i know i'll outsleep them!" or "ha!, your through!" only add to the mock value that gymkata more then obtains. besides it's (wisely) the only movie that has are hero a gymnast who finds things to swing on in the heat of the moment.
