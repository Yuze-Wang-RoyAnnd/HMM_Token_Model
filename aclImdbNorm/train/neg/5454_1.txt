wow, this film was just bloody horrid. so bad in fact that even though i didn't pay to see it, i still wanted my money back.<br /><br />the film is about nothing intelligible. it's a mish-mash of sci-fi cliche's that were done better by much more skilled film makers. the performances, especially by the leads were over the top in a less endearing ed wood sort of way. speaking of ed wood, he'd be proud of the character's dialogue. it's just too taciturn with no hint of irony or sense of humor. on top of that, it doesn't make sense, nor does the plot, or lackthereof.<br /><br />the visual effects are okay, but not enough to go "oh wow, that's cool" and they just seem to be thrown in to "be cool" rather than be a good plot device.<br /><br />the soundtrack was another mishmash of stuff that really never set any sort of mood. again, it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to "be cool".<br /><br />which brings me to my final point. perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot, story and dialogue instead of trying to "be cool", he wouldn't have made such a dorky cliche' of a short film.<br /><br />
