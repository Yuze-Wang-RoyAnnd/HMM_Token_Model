i gave this movie a very fair chance, and it betrayed me. this is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist bogdanavich (who did way better with targets) gets "great performances" out of a ton of hams in their debuts. lots of teenage sex clich'es come out of this movie, such as doing the teacher's wife, impotence, doing the ugly prostitute(which is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt, not that things were really going anywhere anyway) and skinny dipping.<br /><br />i suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense, to me, it was just annoying. i was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess.
