i suppose many people comment/review their first movie on imdb because the movie was spectacular or horrible -- i'm writing due to the latter.<br /><br />i was excited for the sequel to "wargames" .. i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content, i felt it was worth watching more than once. this being 2008, i had high hopes for what they would do with this film. computers, gaming, terror, military over-zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film, and "wargames: the dead code" had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick.<br /><br />the movie failed on pretty much every level, but i particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects. "the dead code" was a 1990's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms. meanwhile, will farmer is button mashing about 7,000 commands -- none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen. until finally he "wins" by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (nobody is near the gas). because he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes, this tells ripley (the real life war machine) that he is a high level terror threat.<br /><br />even though any 5-16 year old could complete this same task - the government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity. they say things like "he has expert knowledge of bio-terror" ... he displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the wiki entry on bio-terror. so then a movie-long chase scene with about .01% of the budget and excitement of any of the bourne titles ensues. they have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter.. sometimes they are mad they barely miss him.. but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him.<br /><br />ugh... i would write more.. but i already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, i would rather watch the broderick and joshua play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.
