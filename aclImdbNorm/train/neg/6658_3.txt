there are some redeeming qualities to this show. one is that the theme tune does have a decent melody. the show does have a nice premise. also, i am probably in the minority, but i like wanda. i like the fact she is caring, and is more a mother figure to timmy. however, despite all this, i do not like this show, it isn't excrement but i do find it very annoying.<br /><br />i wouldn't say that it is the best animated show on planet earth. when i use that term for an animated tv show, i think of peter pan and the pirates, i think of darkwing duck, i think of scooby doo and i think of talespin. and i hope i am not the only one who really likes the wild thornberrys and resent the fact it gets poked fun at. nor do i think fairly odd parents is the worst animated show on planet earth. i accept it's annoying, and in some ways overrated, but it isn't the worst show on nickolodean. that is chalk zone, god that show is unwatchable. but the worst animated show i've ever seen is shaggy and scooby doo:get a clue, which is crudely animated, unfunny and frankly a disgrace.<br /><br />one thing i don't like about this show is the animation. the characters, forgive me if i offend, have very weird facial features, and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make spongebob squarepants and wild thornberrys so nice to look at. the characters with the exception of wanda i find very annoying. i can't believe such a talented voice actress like tara strong(aka. charendoff) voiced timmy. timmy i don't find very likable as a lead character at all, he is annoying and sometimes patronising, and he is a poor decision maker as well. and his voice gets on my nerves. i actually like strong but not in this show. another annoying character is cosmo, the supposedly funny character. instead, his jokes are as unfunny as they could become. they are either a) contrived, or b) over familiar. timmy's parents are awful characters, who don't give a toss about their son, and their personalities wear well thin.<br /><br />the story lines are very unoriginal on the most part, and i keep thinking, where have i seen this before. the episodes after the arrival of the baby i thought were unwatchable. even worse is the scripts, very unfunny, childish, witless and suffer from a complete lack of energy.<br /><br />all in all, not the worst show ever, but pretty poor for an animation fan, and fairly uncomfortable to sit through. 3/10- there are redeeming qualities, and i completely understand if people like it. bethany cox
