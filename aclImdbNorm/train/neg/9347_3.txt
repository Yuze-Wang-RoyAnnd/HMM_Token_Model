this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment, promising to develop into something worth hanging on for. but it doesn't. it's flat, self conscious, unimaginative and tedious.<br /><br />a series of set images and backdrops don't make a film, they make a calendar. this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary ("it's true it really happened") not only fails to entertain, it fails to convince, so it doesn't even function as social history. clich'es co-mingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish, the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly. the characters are one dimensional, never developing to the extent that one feels for them. the director's ego is the largest character in this film.
