this is an extremely boring film. if you grew up during the vietnam was, as i did, then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. but what really makes this film boring is the narration by director carlton sherwood. the majority of the film is shot with sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.<br /><br />if you're old enough to remember vietnam, then you won't find anything new here. there is no new evidence to condemn john kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on vietnam. younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george butler's excellent film going upriver! stolen honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on john kerry, but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal.
