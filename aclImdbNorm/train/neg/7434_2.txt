if this is based on the true-life relationship, as purported, between ms. curtin and mr. levinson, i'm thrilled i do not know them personally. this is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the movie while the theme song gets played into the ground. many stupid scenes with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy.
