this movie is spoofed in an episode of mystery science theater 3000. i think mst3k was at its best when they ripped this movie.<br /><br />terrible acting, bad makeup, poor effects, chick in skimpy (1960's)underwear. i give it a 2.<br /><br />the villain is hard to understand due to the makeup. the assistant says things like 'not you' that sound like nachoo!! (think sneezing). it's just poor oration. the long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters. <br /><br />i still don't know what 'the projected man' means in terms of the plot. i missed some of the beginning though. <br /><br />what is up with this 10 line minimum on posting??
