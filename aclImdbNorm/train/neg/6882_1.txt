i hated the way ms. perez portrayed puerto ricans! we are not all ghetto - and we do speak spanish- not puerto rican! i can not speak for the uneducated persons you have run into. but our language is intact, our island is our pride. puerto rico is better off economically than any other caribbean island! i'm glad we are not like cuba, dominican republic or haiti, free from american influence? free in true poverty, not the u.s. standard of poverty. we are not victims we are resilient, humble,honest and intelligent people. our ancestry does include strong african roots, but not "black" roots- i have nothing in common with black americans 9do the research).<br /><br />the analogy between pedro albizu, che guevarra and martin l. king could not be more off the mark.<br /><br />mlk was a great hero a true revolutionary- an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free.<br /><br />che guevarra helped castro create the cuba that is today, is that why boat fulls of cubans risk their lives to come to america- because che made such a better place for them? you had a great, awesome, bright idea but you politicized it too much. we have so many things to be proud of as a people - don't bring shame to our people by victimizing us. i am not a nuyorican and perhaps that is why i can't share your views. i am puerto rican, i speak spanish, i am not a victim and i have been able to accomplish many of my goals in america. if there is a part 2 in the future - less politics more history more stories of triumph- there are many.<br /><br />damaris maldonado
