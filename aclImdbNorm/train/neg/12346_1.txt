this film's basic premise is a political cartoon. i suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a "feel-good" film on gender equality. indeed a recent commentator stated: "it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do." what claptrap! no one, man or woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately demi moore "buffing" up for seal hell week in the early 27 week bud/s program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a seal is simply not going to make it so. there is approximately an 80% dropout rate in what is arguably the roughest military training program - those are the ones who voluntarily drop out, can't compete on a physical level, suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can't handle the psychological harassment. i never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived, purported message of this film. in the real world, demi wouldn't last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training. wishing alone won't do it. skip this film as wishful thinking, and better spend your time reading "the warrior elite" by dick couch (crown, new york 2001)for the best description as to what really goes on in this training. ring the bell, demi!<br /><br />
