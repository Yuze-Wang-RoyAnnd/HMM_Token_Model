one of the worst movies i've ever seen with robert de niro, the fan is a pointless clich'e of an exercise in slasher flicks. it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) we're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? the movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. this is as big a dud as they come. stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies
