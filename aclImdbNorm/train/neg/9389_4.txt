according to imdb, as well as to every other website that holds a review; this "thing" doesn't have a director. well, that would surely explain a lot! just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra-thin storyline about devil-worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium. "hardgore" is a prime example of totally demented 70's smut, as it's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration. horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70's and pornography as well, so why not combine the two? here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who's committed to a mental asylum, and from the first night already, she's drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. really, a lot of dildo-action. the friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she has her throat slit even the same night. the horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated, going from laughably un-scary satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks. the photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish, but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm-firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs? leading lady justina lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body, but most of her co-stars (male & female) are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls.
