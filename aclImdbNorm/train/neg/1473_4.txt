a thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims, along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine, and here susan lucci performs as a siren, although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one. isabelle (lucci), inconstant wife of venture capitalist stewart collins (john o'hurley), begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman richard davis (philip casnoff), simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for richard, apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent. when davis becomes convinced that guileful isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband, he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself, coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent stewart. in the wake of the hit-man's assault upon collins, a pair of police detectives, performed by joe grifasi and dean mcdermott, become increasingly curious concerning isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering. lucci and kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators, each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds, but o'hurley and mcdermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements. released upon a fremantle dvd, this largely lustreless affair depicting a man 'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality, and although no extra features are provided, the above-average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer robert primes and composer stephen edwards.
