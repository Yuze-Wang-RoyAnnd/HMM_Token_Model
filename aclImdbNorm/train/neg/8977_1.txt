a female country singer nicknamed "big t"--seriously, that's what they call her--risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard (busey) who wants to be her manager. his mother committed suicide, his father's an alcoholic as well, and he has a violent temper. you can imagine where that leads. in the meantime, there's music aplenty, as parton, with her fluid vocal talents, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about texas). steer clear of this mess and check her out in nine to five or steel magnolias instead.
