a stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and sub-par (to say the least) dialogue plagues this tv production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget.<br /><br />the characters aren't believable, in their motives, actions or their professed occupations. the plot reads like a bad dungeons and dragons(tm) hack but with plasma rifles and force fields. there are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author, at least, wincing. <br /><br />avoid it like the plague. watch any episode of dark angel and you will have better acting, dialogue and plot. yuck.
