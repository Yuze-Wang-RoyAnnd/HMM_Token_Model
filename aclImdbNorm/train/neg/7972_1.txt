i love b movies..but come on....this wasn't even worth a grade...the ending was dumb...b/c there was no real ending!!!..not to mention that it comes to life on its own...i mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers?? slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period...and i won't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head....and then you don't even get to see what jigsaw even does with his so called "new jigsaw puzzle"....unless you have nothing better to do...id watch paint dry before id recommend this god-forsaken movie to anyone else...oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window..that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film
