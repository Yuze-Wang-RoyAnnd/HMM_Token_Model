i've read comments that you shouldn't watch this film if you're looking for stirring shakespearian dialogue. this is true, unfortunately, because all the stirring dialogue, this wonderful play contains, has been cut, and replaced with songs. i've read this play, and recently was lucky enough to see it performed, at it remains one of my favourite shakespearian comedies, but this movie seems to take all that i like about it away. the princess, though no doubt doing what she was directed to do, had no regal bearing, and all the girls seemed to lose the cleverness of their characters - also affected by unwise cuts, which not only took away the female characters already sparse dialogue, but took comments out of context - it was a little unnerving to hear the princess proclaim; "we are wise girls to mock our lovers so!", when mocking had not taken place at all. the news reels throughout the film also disrupted the flow, and took away many excellent scenes, as they showed the information in the scenes after them, and were in modern phrasing. in conclusion, an excellent play, ruined by an odd concept, and unwise cuts. kenneth, i usually love what you do. what were you thinking?
