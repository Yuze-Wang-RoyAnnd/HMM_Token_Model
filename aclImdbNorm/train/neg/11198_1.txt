i shouldn't even review this movie, since it's not actually a horror movie -- and thus not worthy of dr. cheese's attention. at least, it's not horror in the usual sense. it's certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap. that's why i turned it off after the first four hours. imagine my surprise, then, when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. yep, that's right; in plain terms, this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g.<br /><br />"the order" had lots of flaws, not all of them unique. in particular, it seems to me the main problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror films is hollywood's unwillingness to engage christianity on its own terms. it is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox. just ask william peter blatty. in fact, without orthodoxy, films like this are just an anything-goes smorgasbord of the filmmakers' (usually dull and illogical) imaginations.<br /><br />think about it. if someone made a movie ostensibly about, say, physics, but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong, but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals, you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot. the same goes for these sorts of movies.<br /><br />in other words, "the order"(and many similar movies before it) invent out of whole cloth stuff about the catholic church and about the christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions. unsurprisingly, the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid. this movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing.<br /><br />avoid this steaming pile.
