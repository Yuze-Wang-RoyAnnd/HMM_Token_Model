absolute garbage, worse fight scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or american ninja etc.<br /><br />truly dire acting, not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden sculptures.<br /><br />watch it just for how truly bad this film is, it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie, i don't have much love for this movie as it wasn't born in the 80s.<br /><br />if you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector, those are proper martial arts films.<br /><br />have a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is.
