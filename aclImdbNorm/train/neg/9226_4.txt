okay, the film festival crowd probably loved it. but your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to-gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice. if it's stamped "copolla" it's automatically great stuff, right? wrong! it's a neat spoof of filmdom's pretensions. but it's terribly "in." i worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public. it's interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it. but once it's run its course in the movies and on tv, the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it. hardly either epochal or an epic!
