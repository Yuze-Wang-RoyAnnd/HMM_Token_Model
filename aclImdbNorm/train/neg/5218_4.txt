all the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place: dialog riddled with biological techno-babble, chintzy sets, balsa-wood acting, a horrific late-'80s casio score, and an overall look that suggests anything on the sci-fi channel's programming schedule, circa 1993. though "metamorphosis" starts off with a lot of promise, the film unravels into bland idiocy and mst3k-style cheese as clark kent wannabe 'doctor' peter houseman (gene lebrock) is pressured into releasing information on his secretive projects. but when he tests his vague experiment on himself, he transforms into a vaguely-defined creature (that bears more than a passing resemblance to 'dr. freudstein' from "house by the cemetery"). the fx work is fairly good for such an obviously low-budget production (though i suspect most of it is kept in shadow for a reason), but overall, "metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your guts, in spite of its hopes to sway us otherwise. i can't help but agree with one character's closing remark: "(it was) a nightmare...from the past!"
