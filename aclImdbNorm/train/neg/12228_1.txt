a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. the premise seems simple enough: yentl, a girl interested in studying the talmud, wants to go to school. but only boys are allowed to study, so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. she does and becomes close friends with avigdor, who is to be married to a beautiful woman named hadass. hadass' family learns avigdor's brother committed suicide, and the wedding is called off. yentl, now calling herself anschel, is then selected to marry hadass. she does but it is never consummated. yentl/anschel and avigdor go away for a few days, and yentl/anschel reveals her secret to him. the movie ends with avigdor returning to (and marrying?) hadass, and yentl going to america to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise.<br /><br />the plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long, but there are several things that ruin it. for starters, there is the constant singing. (i can already hear the critics shouting.) yes, i know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. but the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. the songs become tedious after a while, and there isn't as much dancing as one would expect. many of the songs are forgettable, with no real memorable lyrics, and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over. only one song stands out from the rest, "papa can you hear me". it is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is, so the songs really aren't necessary. <br /><br />second, streisand's makeup, which can be seen during her scenes as a man (the lipstick, enhanced lashes, and traces of blush are all obvious) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the yentl/anschel character, that she is actually serious, and fooling her new friends, colleagues, and even hadass, into believing she is a man. yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. there seems to be a contradiction, as her character talks, or rather sings, of how she doesn't think she can pull it off, but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. this means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences, such as her actions, which are clear giveaways. the facial differences alone cannot be included, as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn't have a beard or other facial hair. nevertheless, in the 1900s, if a woman dressed as a man, but wore as much makeup as streisand's character did, and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing, it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town, or even the country. therefore the "feminine" makeup on streisand does not lend to the character's credibility, and only weakens the plot. if it was only applied to make streisand look more beautiful, it should have been scrapped. <br /><br />thirdly, when yentl/anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end, we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as streisand's and only when they learn the "truth" do they become a little wiser. by now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for streisand to fuel.<br /><br />lastly, there are those who are fans of streisand who will find no fault with this film, its plot, or the songs. to those i must respectfully disagree. while she has excellent vocal and acting abilities, i am not a "fan" of her style of singing. however, i have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. there are even some songs of hers that i like, so i am not a "hater" nor have set out to bash her. i have written this review from an honest perspective, from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within. if streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film, she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented, beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. this movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities, make her appear self-absorbed, and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans or audience.
