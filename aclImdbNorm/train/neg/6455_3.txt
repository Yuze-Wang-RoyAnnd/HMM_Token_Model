really a terrible movie. it's to be expected, though. clearly a low budget: nothing all that innovative, an actress (if you can call what she does "acting") who always has roles with nudity in a shower scene, a man in a reptile suit almost modeled after predator, a cabin in the woods, etc. but there are some redeeming points. although the story is not new, for the most part, there's a few parts that aren't so regurgitated. for one, the black guy doesn't die when he's attacked (the first time) and he isn't even one of the first couple to die. but that's minor. more importantly, there's a very interesting twist regarding kat's experiments and wes & steve that i didn't see coming. when steve told kat he knew what she did, i believed what he said and what kat replied with. but when the creature revealed who he really was, i was pleasantly surprised at the novelty of the revelation. it could be because of my lack of experience with the genre, or that it's a genuinely clever twist.<br /><br />either way, the movie's pretty bad and don't watch it if there's anything better on... unless you're in the mood for a cheap scifi flick.
