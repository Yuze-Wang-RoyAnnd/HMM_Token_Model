i remember back when i was little when i was away at camp and we would campout under the stars. there was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out. well, when i found wendigo at the library, i checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp. well, much to my dismay, i was so far from the truth. wendigo is really bad. the story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin, which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and they run into a deer. well, it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk. the movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film. it wasn't until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the "wendigo." my suggestion is that you stay very far away this film. it will leave you wanting your hour and a half back.
