you know those films that have you trapped in the cinema? you're stuck there in the best seat in the house, centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking "when the f*** is this film ever going to end???" (you know the feeling - think of a.i. and the village).<br /><br />well, visitor q delivers a weird variant of that feeling. i sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f***ing start! it is interminable! so "arty" it hurts. this is the first miike takashi film i have watched. apparently he makes films by the dozen and, if they are all pretentious w@nk like this, i suspect it will be the last.<br /><br />i'm not against pretentious w@nk. david lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but visitor q is cut-rate, cheap, and nasty pretentious w@nk. <br /><br />as you may have worked out by now - i hated it.
