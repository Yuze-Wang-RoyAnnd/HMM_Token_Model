i'm a big fan of italian films from the seventies, and i wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful barbara bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so i did go into this film with some hopes. however, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere. clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. as the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. that's basically all the plot that this movie has. the film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well. seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. overall, the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.
