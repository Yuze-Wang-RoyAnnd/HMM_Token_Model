a schizophrenic has escaped from a nyc mental hospital and soon teachers start getting offed at st. trinity university. new teacher julie (francine forbes) has to deal with the mess of red herrings. despite a 78 minute running time, this cheap-o slasher drags on and on until the lame finish where the person you suspect is the killer from the get go is revealed to be as such. director richard haines barely breaks a sweat with some lame stalk-n-slash staging but delivers the grue the early 80s audience was probably craving. for all of our amateur anthropologists out there, this was filmed in new yawk in early 80s so you can check out all of the culture, beliefs, and practices of living people from that far away place. the film does get some credit for offing the "final girl." you rarely see that. also, always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer. doth thou not trust the clergy, my beloved film industry? thankfully, this one is only a phony priest and he gets caught. he is still working the moral high ground angle though.
