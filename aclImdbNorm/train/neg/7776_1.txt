what a load of rubbish.. i can't even begin to describe how awful this film was. the rating it has here is really hard to believe.<br /><br />avoid... particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps. the first one was well written, well directed, well executed.. a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere. the second one was 'alrite'- decent as a self-standing film, but clearly not up to the level of the first... the third is an insult to the series, period. i rate the films: 10, 6, 1. it's that bad.<br /><br />oh, and yes it really is set in the past, the sisters are still called ginger and b fitzgerald... all muddled in with some half-assed native american mythology. the sisters don't have any real story, or progression, or even a clear relationship... they're just trying to survive and be 'together forever'. that's about as deep as it gets.<br /><br />staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pile-of-shite, after reading the script.<br /><br />oh and another thing, staging of action was terrible- people appearing from nowhere regularly, like the girls turn around and there's an elaborate candle-lit setup with a mystic native american woman just sitting there, about to go into a speech. sets were terrible, couldn't get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set, which really didn't help. also, there was consistently snow outside the camp, but not a trace inside (..on the set).<br /><br />arrghh,,, so bad! i really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second one.
