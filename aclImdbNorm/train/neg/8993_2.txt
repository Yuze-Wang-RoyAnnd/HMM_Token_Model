back in the 70's, when i had first seen this, i was in high school. it was cool then. now as an adult i look back at it and i say to myself..yeah right. what was so funny? it has it's moments but they are few and far between. it is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up. show this to a younger crowd and they will be totally lost. if you like this type of humor you may want to stick with kentucky fried movie or amazon women from the moon. tunnel vision as well as groove tube are too dated for today's viewing.
