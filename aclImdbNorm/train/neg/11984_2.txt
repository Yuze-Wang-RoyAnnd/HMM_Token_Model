ugh! another one of those "fooled by the cover" dvds. i expected some kind of action at least with bears, cats, & such on the cover. i got nothing! bad movie!.<br /><br />i forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually something would happen...no luck.<br /><br />now the reason i gave this a 2 is because of the scenery; otherwise it sucked.<br /><br />the kid was terrible, talking to himself (although i suppose they couldn't just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all), doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump, threatening a raccoon, munching on worms, and (what a dumbass) kicking a porcupine. and he wouldn't be pulling those quills out that easily either...they stick like fishhooks. at least he fought the bear (weakly) a couple of times.<br /><br />what was up with the flashback thing? it made a bad movie even worse. i wanted to see a survival movie, not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce.<br /><br />what else can i say? well, maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something. at least that would have been more exciting.<br /><br />people, don't waste your time on this one.
