if you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, please don't give up on the series. i bought my first copy of any of the books in may of this year, and already i'm almost finished with book 10. i dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesn't do the series even a sniff of justice. while "left behind: the movie" only vaguely follows the story of the "left behind" (the book), the characters aren't even close to accurate.<br /><br />a few examples: rayford never acts on his feelings for hattie (he is about to when he's informed of the vanishings); buck williams is a blonde haired, magazine writer, not a tv reporter; chloe is at stanford, and a lot of the book details rayford wondering if she 'survived'; buck and chloe don't meet until much later, at a meeting in new york, set up by hattie; irene and raymie are never 'in the book,' rather just in rayford's flashback thoughts; the roads are so jam packed with wrecks following the rapture that rayford and hattie have to helicopter back to the suburbs... etc, etc, etc...<br /><br />and that's just from the first movie; they're about to release the third. please, even if you didn't like the movies, give the book series a chance.
