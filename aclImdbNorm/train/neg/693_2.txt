((nb: spoiler warning, such as it is!))<br /><br />first off, this is a teen slasher flick -- the spam-in-a-cabin genre, as joe bob briggs piquantly put it. if you're looking for roshambo, this isn't it and wasn't going to be it. i'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography, directing or acting performances.<br /><br />secondly, this wasn't zuniga's first horror flick, it was her first screen appearance period, cinema, tv, whatever. for what it is worth; neither is daphne zuniga susan sarandon or katherine hepburn.<br /><br />thirdly, you have to give even a lame slasher flick props. sure, it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre: any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof, and the harvest time is now.<br /><br />except this one gives the chop to the sweet, virginal protagonist as well! now there is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions! interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role. another one hit wonder, except that term gives the lass too much credit.<br /><br />(then again, this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actors in history. of the nineteen credited actors, a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film. three appeared in one other movie by the same producers. only one other besides zuniga has as many as six screen credits. what was this, the has been and never were mutual aid society?)<br /><br />granted, i saw this a long time ago on late night cable when i was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again, but i see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with joanne.<br /><br />2/10.
