i read rice's novel with interest, and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths.<br /><br />however, i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation. the casting was based merely on physical appearance, and not acting talent (with the obvious exception of peter gallagher, who was neither blond-haired, or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag). the cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious, but not in an entertaining way. i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe, and was surprised i made it to the end.<br /><br />a warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one.
