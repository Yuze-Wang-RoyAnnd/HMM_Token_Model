to say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks. as the other commenter says, this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 (it is especially, incredibly insulting to gays). it is awful - and not in a "so bad it's funny" sort of way either - it's just plain awful. no, i have to say it: it stinks! (sorry skunks).<br /><br />from the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for. the "plot" is incoherent, the characterization non-existent, the acting is of the over the top mugging "look at me i'm being funny!" school and so it goes on. the set pieces are clumsily set up (if at all) and are badly executed, it's just awful on every front - apart from the music maybe, i don't remember thinking the music stinks (apart from the songs).<br /><br />to be fair to the makers, they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly: the opening credits include the title "also starring ertha kitt as the voice of betty the meteor" (since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted ms. kitt's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the movie runs something like: "...and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around uranus." uranus - "your anus" geddit? geddit? huh? huh?? your anus? the humour really is that cheap.<br /><br />it says strange things about the "comedies" of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say "sh*t" out loud.<br /><br />i paid fifty pence (about $1.00) for this movie in a sale. i feel ripped off.
