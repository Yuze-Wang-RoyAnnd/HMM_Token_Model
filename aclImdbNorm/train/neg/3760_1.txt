this is the biggest piece of lamo i've ever watched. it is excruciatingly boring i would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was. not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a 1.<br /><br />the reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is "unintentionally funny" are absurd and just plain wrong. not one thing is funny about this movie. they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you wouldn't understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so uninteresting. honestly though, i didn't watch it to the ending, but that should say something about how horrible it is. worst movie ever.<br /><br />immediately after ejecting this filth from my dvd player i started scraping it against the cement in front of my house, not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie. then zach peed his pants. thankyou for your time.
