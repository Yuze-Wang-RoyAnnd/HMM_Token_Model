the order starts in rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts & demons named brother dominic (francesco carnelutti) is found dead, cut to new york city where one of his order alex bernier (heath ledger) is contacted by top-brass cardinal driscoll (peter weller) who ask's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding dominic's death. along with his girlfriend mara willims (shannyn sossamon) & fellow priest thomas garrett (mark addy) alex travels to italy to delve into his mentor's death, as the truth begins to emerge it appears that dominic was a 'sin eater' someone who absorbed other's sins & lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully & that the church wasn't happy about his activities. alex must do what's right even if it goes against what he believes...<br /><br />also know under the title the sin eater this american german co-production was written, produced & directed by bian helgeland & didn't really do that much for me if i'm honest & i usually am, honest that is. anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some ok ideas but it's throughly predictable, excruciatingly dull & boring, really silly at times & it takes itself far too seriously. the whole concept is daft & while it thinks it's clever with it's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up & brings the story full circle i thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end things. there's the usual religious themes here, morality, sin, forgiveness, faith, belief, prophecy's, blah, blah, blah you know the sort of thing. then there's the twists which aren't hard to see coming, there's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen, corruption, greed, evil, etc. you know the sort of clich'ed hollywood ideals & themes that get reused every time it deals with the church. the order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film-making it sucks, a lot. i'm not too sure who the order is meant to appeal to, as a die-hard horror fan i didn't see much horror in this at all, as a thriller it's less than thrilling, as a mystery it's too predictable & there's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest & for some reason i cannot figure out the imdb also lists the order as an action film which is absurd as it's as exciting & action-packed as the average episode of sesame street (1969 - present), harsh maybe but it's what i think...<br /><br />director helgeland does an ok job, the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab, grayish & dull. for a supposed horror film the order is very light on scares or horror elements, in fact there aren't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason, don't ask. forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make the order somewhat watchable. according the imdb's 'trivia' section the release date of the order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny, all i can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren't exactly brilliant as it stands now.<br /><br />i was amazed to see the order had a budget of about $28,000,000 which is a hell of a lot of money & i just can't see where it all went apart from the sets & production design which are good. the whole film looks & feels very average & utterly forgettable. the acting is ok although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul-mouthed comic relief irritates, a good actor such as peter weller deserves better than this.<br /><br />the order, i prefer the title the sin eater actually not that it matters too much, misses all of it's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as i'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don't do it! not recommended.
