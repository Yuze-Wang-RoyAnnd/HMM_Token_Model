lady in cement - pi spoof with ole blue eyes.frank sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in miami in this rarely funny "comedy".burdened by an annoying and repetitious hugo montenegro score and bunch of misfiring punchlines this 1968 flick just never rises above slightly too bawdy to be on tv made for television movie status.dan blocker is effective in the mike mazurski/ted de corsia big galoot role and raquel welch should thank her personal trainer.the only thing that makes the dvd worth keeping or seeing is the collection of cheesy trailers for welch flicks like bandolero,fantastic voyage , mother ,jugs & speed and myra breckinridge.even if you get the dvd-skip the predictable movie and go for the trailer library in the special features.besides tons of mysoginistic asides-sinatra lisps @ the homosexual owners of the local go-go bar.a relic that needs to be put back in the time capsule. d
