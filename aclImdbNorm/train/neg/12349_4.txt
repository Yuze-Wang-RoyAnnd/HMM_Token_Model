a real disappointment from the great visual master ridley scott. g.i. jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the navy seals. the training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character o'neil played by demi moore. there is no particular message or point in this film or then i couldn't reach it properly. it may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film.<br /><br />i really can't understand why ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert?! it looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so i would really like to know what the director saw in that technique. when i look at his latest film, black hawk dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes (which are plenty) and they are very intense and directed with skill. the whole finale in g.i. jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing.<br /><br />this is ridley scott's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known. still i'm glad i saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of scott's abilities, but they are very few in this film.<br /><br />a disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (blade runner, thelma & louise, alien and so on..) of this talented director. so i'm forced to give g.i. jane 4/10.
