i remember when this came out a lot of kids were nuts about it. i guess i was a bit too old to get all excited and i was a fan of real martial arts films and always found this a bit cheesy.<br /><br />in the early 90's we were swamped with programs such as this making kids feel like they could fight and be a power ranger or an equal to these kids on 3 ninjas. i think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was abunch of kids going around punching and hitting everyone.<br /><br />many kids movies have some big point they're trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message, this one doesn't have any message at all...it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes.<br /><br />the movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to? the acting is pretty bad. victor wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here.. the short, fat, gimped eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious. the kids over acted way too much and the youngest ninja tum tum was maybe the worst kid actor i have ever seen.<br /><br />the movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review. 3 ninjas...yea you know they're gonna fight a bunch of bad guys and win obviously... need i say more. sorry if i spoiled it for anyone.<br /><br />with all that said kids will love it. this movie is aimed at kids and only children could enjoy it. if you don't mind your kid seeing movies about kids fighting this is a good movie to let them see. if you don't mind allowing your children to see complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts, real acting or reality period then you have found a movie for your kids... i say kids because i think even the girls will like it... i recall all the girls having a crush on rocky.<br /><br />2 out of 10 stars because i think you can make a movie for kids and still make it enjoyable for adults..this movie failed big time at that.. it is beyond cheesy and nothing original or unique and i would not allow a child of mine to watch it... kung fu the tv series is on dvd and there's tons of great shaw brothers films out there...why not show your children things that will really entertain them and not make them dumb along the way, perhaps even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as grandpa did on 3 ninjas...no no no...never kick a man between the legs ...never .. thats so unninja like.
