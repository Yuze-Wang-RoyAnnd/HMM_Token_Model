"new best friend" is another entry in the "steal another woman's life" sub-genre; the best of which are "single white female" and "the hand that rocks the cradle"; the worse of which you can catch almost any afternoon on the lifetime channel. for some reason this type of identity theft happens exclusively to women.<br /><br />there are just two basic ways to play this type of story. you can make the woman evil at the beginning and let the audience watch knowingly as she hatches and implements her evil scheme. or you use misdirection to make her appear a good person, as a seemingly unplanned series of events break in her favor until she is revealed to be evil in the climatic scene. unfortunately the makers of "new best friend" could not decide how they wanted to play it and things crash and burn early. we first meet alicia (mia kirshner) scamming the college's financial aid office for scholarship money. we now know that she is a bad person and will view all her subsequent activity with suspicion. but the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spend the next 50 minutes laying misdirection to make us think that alicia is a good person. this introduces the only element of suspense, not about whether she is evil but about when the director and editor will wise up and stop wasting our time with transparent misdirection.<br /><br />"new best friend" suffers more than most from the teen movie curse of a cast too old to be portraying undergraduate students. there are really only two big parts, hadley (meredith monroe) and alicia (kirshner). they were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of the production. it almost works for the 26 year-old kirshner when she plays the mousy version of alicia but it becomes glaring when she is transformed into the glamed-up version of alicia. monroe's casting is simply a joke, about like having nicholette sheridan try to pass as a classmate on "lizzie mcgwire". she looks much closer to a mid-life crisis than to a term paper.<br /><br />the producers must have owed a lot of favors because this age issue extends to most of the supporting characters. taye diggs who plays the town sheriff is younger than most of the students.<br /><br />the basic setup is that hadley and two other rich party girls (played by dominque swain-age 21 and rachel true-age 35) are undergrad roommates at college. they share (as their student residence) a mansion that is nicer and better furnished than the mansion on real world-new orleans (a premise more believable than soccer moms playing students). alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over hadley's life. at least that way swain finally gets a roommate from her own generation so the two can have a lesbian scene. swain's supporting performance is the only good thing about "new best friend" and her love scene with kirshner is fantastic, so cool and artsy that it doesn't fit with any of the other segments, maybe it was subcontracted out to a good director and cinematographer.<br /><br />the unintentionally hilarious story is presented in a series of dreary flashbacks of rampant sex and nonstop parties, each proceeded by a shot of a comatose alicia in a hospital bed. about half of kirshner's screen time is spent lying motionless with a tube in her mouth. not a good career move mia.<br /><br />then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.
