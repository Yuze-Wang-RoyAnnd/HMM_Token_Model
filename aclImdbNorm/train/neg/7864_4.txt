the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. of course it's not going to be an oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.<br /><br />the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. it's just them fighting back throughout the whole film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing, and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.<br /><br />i'd give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on, as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment, something to pass time if you're bored, and nothing else.<br /><br />4/10
