i just didn't get this movie...was it a musical? no..but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it...<br /><br />was it a serious drama....no the acting was not good enough for that.<br /><br />is whoopi goldberg a quality serious actor..definently not.<br /><br />i had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie. the message on apartheid and the "tribute" to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted. but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse.<br /><br />see for yourself, but in fairness i hated it
