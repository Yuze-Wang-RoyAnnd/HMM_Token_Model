must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time, but this one is up there with the worst of them. plot troubling to follow. sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film.<br /><br />i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two. sadly, in my case, i have the dvd. it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
