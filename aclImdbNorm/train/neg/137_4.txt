its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these 'teen slasher' movies. they are so unbelievably formulaic. and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier, i'm sure they would have been spoofing this film too - that's if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams, i know what you did last summers, and urban legends.<br /><br />valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except a better than usual ending which, of course, leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel. as always, a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women, killing the main character's friends, one by one, in typically over the top style. lots of t&a on display, no character development, bad acting, and overly elaborate bloodshed.<br /><br />the thing i can't stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as 'who done its?'. the thing is that they aren't because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked, and tells the main character who's friends have now all been murdered. usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway (eg. main character's mother's uncle's fishing partner kicked his friend's father's dog). everybody still left alive throughout the film is a 'suspect', but they are more 'red herrings' than suspects. as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed.<br /><br />valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. ***************spoiler!!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway)*************** in valentine the motive was not revealed, but more, left for you to think about given that the film didn't quite conclude in the typical 'teen slash' way. the issue is only part resolved, and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody. will the killer want more, or were the demons truly vanquished?<br /><br />this still didn't make valentine a good film, instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual, which still doesn't count for much. to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines, please don't. originality is so important, and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre.
