yeah, that about sums it up. this movie was horrifying. two minutes in i wanted to gouge my eyes out. this has been praised as an "innovative lds comedy," but it's not even good for members of that church! i don't think any human being should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this low quality.<br /><br />first of all, you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie. it seems as if the horribly drab, glib, trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent (at least semi-coherent) thought. then, there's the acting, which is dismal from *everybody* involved. even the cameos fail to liven anything up.<br /><br />and let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change, but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue, appallingly hideous "gags," and a lot of mormon "in-jokes" that anyone in their right mind, lds or not, should consider purely *stupid*! this has to be one of the worst films i've ever seen!
