why, oh, why won't they learn? when you've got a nice, juicy exploitation gimmick, use it! don't go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful; you're only gonna wind up looking foolish.<br /><br />christmas evil is the story of harry stadling, who saw a little bit too much of mommy kissing (daddy-dressed-as-)santa claus back when he was a kid. so, of course, harry grows up obsessed with christmas, and finally, when his disillusionment becomes too great, he flips out, dresses as santa, and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children, and viciously killing anyone he deems naughty.<br /><br />simple enough, and not a bad place to start. (after all, how many other holiday-themed horror flicks use the same schtick?) unfortunately, this film wants to be more "santa, portrait of a serial killer" than "silent night, deadly night". two-thirds of the film are spent documenting harry's slow but inevitable breakdown, when i would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling. you know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it already.<br /><br />perhaps harry's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director, but alas, we've got some guy named lewis jackson. apparently, this is his only film, and it shows. the action jumps giddily from scene to scene, without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing.<br /><br />even once the film gets rolling, we're still treated to heaping helpings of harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. more depressing than frightening, christmas evil is one to avoid.
