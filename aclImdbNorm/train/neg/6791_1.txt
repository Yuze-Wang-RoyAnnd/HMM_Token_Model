this is a movie about animal cruelty. under the guise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death in slow motion. the guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial/burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death. this is one of the sickest, slimiest movies i've ever had the displeasure of viewing. as gene hackman and james coburn near the finish line on their dying animals, we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race. i'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race; i'll decide when they're finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
