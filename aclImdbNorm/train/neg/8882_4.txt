to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight (1939 & 1944) via les diaboliques (1954); while still watchable in itself, it's so clich'e-ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills. however, thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late 1970s, even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names - cliff robertson (as the conniving husband), jean simmons (in the title role), jenny agutter (as robertson's artist half-sister), simon ward (as the enigmatic chauffeur), ron moody (as an ill-fated doctor), michael jayston (as robertson's business partner), judy geeson (as simmons' best friend and jayston's wife), flora robson (as the housekeeper), david tomlinson (as the notary reading simmons' will) and, most surprisingly perhaps, jack warner (as a gravestone sculptor) - although most of them actually have nothing parts, i'm sorry to say!
