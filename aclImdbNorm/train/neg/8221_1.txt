this "film" attempts to follow the genre of low budget, hand-held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful.<br /><br />this one, fails, and how.<br /><br />it's amazing how many so called "awards" this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover..... it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this....<br /><br />words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is. seriously, it's that bad.<br /><br />i watched it in 20 minutes flat, on almost continual fast forward.<br /><br />from rubbish lighting to dreadful directing, grainy visuals to muffled sound, and of course not forgetting the abysmal acting, this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so-called film making.<br /><br />it seriously, has no redeeming qualities - whatsoever. save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick, there are plenty out there - dead end, the blair witch, rec, to name but a few.<br /><br />avoid this rubbish at all costs. do not waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film.<br /><br />take heed of all the other comments! you've been warned!
