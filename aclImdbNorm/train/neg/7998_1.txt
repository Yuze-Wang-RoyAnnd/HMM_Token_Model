not only was he invariably annoying to listen to, but he had no jokes. i swear, some fobby asian guy telling yo momma jokes would've been funnier than leary's crap. (well, maybe funny for a couple minutes but at least i'll be able to laugh at least once!) leary claimed he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes"... apparently he was still high on something; he was just some crackhead imprecating rants mostly drug related. one of his jokes was something like, 'i wouldn't use crack, especially having the same name as between my ass' - oh man, how did he come up with that one?! i swear the only guy that needs to shut the f**k up is denis leary. thank god i didn't have to see him live. this guy totally sucks.<br /><br />if you're easily amused by swearing, and "jokes" where you can come up with yourself, then waste your time with this junk.
