due to budget cuts, ethel janowski (again played by priscilla alden) is released from a mental institution (even though she killed six people) and delivered to the hope bartholomew halfway house. once there, she immediately relapses into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food.<br /><br />holy moly! does this movie suck! you know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film, apparently filmed off a tv screen. nick millard (under his pseudonym nick phillips) decided to return to the world of crazy fat ethel over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend. let's just say that millard's unique style doesn't translate well to video. seriously, i have made home movies with more production value than this. and millard tries to pull a silent night, deadly night 2 by padding half the running time with footage from the first film (which looks like it was taken off a worn vhs copy). alden is again good as ethel but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage. i mean, at least the first film tried. here we have no music, weaker effects (if that is at all possible), shaky camera work, horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two vcrs hooked up. avoid this at all costs!
