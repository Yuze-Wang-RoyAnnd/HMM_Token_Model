this movie had so much potential - a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget. i'm not sure where it all went wrong, but each of those elements was wasted. the story went nowhere, the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring, pointless, waste of a film. i hated it. judging by the other votes, i'm in the minority here and must be some sort of freak. however, i thought this movie was dreadful. i had high hopes, but was very disappointed. a particular disappointment was jody foster's character. a very cocky "fixer" of sorts makes a nice idea. jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere. denzel washington played the same character he always plays - enjoyable but nothing new.
