lulu (louise brooks) works as a typist and is missing something in her life. she enters a miss france contest against the wishes of her boyfriend andre (georges charlia) and she wins. she sets off for the miss europe title leaving her boyfriend behind. she wins again but returns home to andre because he has asked her to. once back together, her life becomes mundane again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as miss europe. andre follows her.....<br /><br />this film is a silent film with a piano music-track all the way through. it is also sped-up so everything seems fast. limited dialogue has been added on afterwards and it is very phony. the cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film. the best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long. after watching this, i'm not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of louise brooks - she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat. i don't need to watch it again.
