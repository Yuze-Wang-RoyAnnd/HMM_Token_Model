lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that stars the wondrous zhang ziyi, in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in 1928 china, just prior to the japanese invasion of manchuria, and reunites with a former lover who is now working for japan. every bit of drama and forward motion of the story is sucked dry by director ye lou's somnambulist directorial style. characters stand still staring at each other for long minutes, saying nothing, hand-held cameras hold forever on faces showing interminable reactions way longer than they need to, edits repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy. we know nothing about the characters as the story begins and are given little new information as the story progresses, only silence and static shots of lovers who don't speak, who interaction through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy. a very sleep inducing film.
