oh dear! the first time i heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot "johny test" while we were playing video games. i thought he was confusing "johny quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons i've ever seen in my life", and changing the "quest" with "test". its something weird that i'm wrong, but actually i was wrong, he wasn't changing nothing, he heard of this show.<br /><br />one day, while watching tv, i heard that cartoon network was going to be released. i wasn't sure of what was the plot of this show, so i adventured myself to watch it, and here is my answer "i want my damn hour back" (because i watched this crap and "my gym partner's a monkey".<br /><br />this is one of the worst shows i've ever seen. first, the beginning, with the most stupid song in the world, then the plot. oh, where are my manners? i haven't said the plot of this show. is about a boy who has to amazingly intelligent sisters, that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother. ohhh, now i see why his name is johny test, he is the test of his sisters experiments.<br /><br />you know, i honestly miss dexter's lab (before it was transformed to the new dexter, a total crap too). this is a bad copy of that old good show, except that this show is amazingly bad. don't watch it, make something more productive in that half-hour than watch this crap.
