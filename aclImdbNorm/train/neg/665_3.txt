in bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher richard fenton (johnathon schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student donna keppel (brittany snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. three years later, the traumatized donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. on her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend bobby (scott porter) and two couples of friends to the pacific grad hotel for the party. but the psychopath richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.<br /><br />the forgettable slash "prom night" is a collection of clich'es with a total lack of originality. the stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of johnathon schaech in the role of an insane killer. the predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): "a morte convida para dancar" ("the death invites to dance")
