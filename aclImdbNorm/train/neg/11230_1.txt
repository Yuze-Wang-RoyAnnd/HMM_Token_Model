in sixth grade, every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester. every class had something to do with this terrible show. we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters. in math we talked about charts and other sea crap. in science we talked about whales (which was actually somewhat interesting, so this wasn't a 100% waste of time). all day everyday was torture. not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well. i could see if this was a new series or something, but it was, like, '93. i'm still trying to block this out.
