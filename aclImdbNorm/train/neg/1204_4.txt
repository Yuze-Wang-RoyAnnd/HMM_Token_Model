i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. it's not that bad for a made-for-tv horror movie, but it is derivative (mostly of the exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. it won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it's not a waste of time, either. it's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard.<br /><br />however, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you won't be disappointed. the early scenes, with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginning.<br /><br />not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv.
