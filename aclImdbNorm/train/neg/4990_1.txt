i can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick, but this is just bad. and not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing mst3k make fun of it. it's just nauseatingly bad like you can't find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try. i truly regret wasting 2 hours of precious life on this crap. you can tell by watching it that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew this film would only bury their careers. apparently "walking tall" has garnered enough income that someone decided they could make a buck off their investment. if it's not the worst film i've seen, it's so bad that it's blotted the worse films from my memory.
