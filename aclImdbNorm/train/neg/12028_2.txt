i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie. very poor acting, offhand production values, utterly pedestrian direction, and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written, let alone produced. even hollywood "professionals" apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential drivel.<br /><br />oth, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad. and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad.
