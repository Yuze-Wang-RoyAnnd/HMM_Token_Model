for starters, "hobgoblins" tries to ape the more successful "gremlins". that's bad enough but they don't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here. instead, it's more like a bargain basement, everything-must-go clearance of embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound fx, acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws 'em down the old tube-aroo.<br /><br />the plot? grrrr.... meddling kids track down gremlin-like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies. sound cool, does it? well, see that wall on the other side of your room? run right at it, top speed, face first. see, that is cooler than this movie.<br /><br />you dare to doubt? quick, name something else one of the leads has been in other than this. what other scripts have the writers done since "hobgoblins"? name another rick sloane directoral effort. how many "hobgoblins" action figures do you have? see? thank you.<br /><br />i cannot believe i took so long to write about such a horrible film. i'd rather write about more important things; like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in europe, that kind of thing. but no, "hobgoblins" it is and it is bad - bad like your grandparents' wallpaper, bad as pink flamingos on your lawn, bad like underwear that says "home of the whopper"...and i think we'll stop there.<br /><br />well, mike and the robots fight valiantly but try as they might, they can do only so much with "hobgoblins" before they realize that, yes, the director does need kicked in the shin.<br /><br />real, real hard.<br /><br />one star for "hobgoblins", seven stars for the mst3k version.
