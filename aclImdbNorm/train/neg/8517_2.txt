the biggest mystery of veronica mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen.<br /><br />rather, the mystery is why this perennial ratings disappointment is still on the air. this week marked a nadir for veronica mars: it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be big 5). yes, you read right. veronica mars was beaten by every show of the now-defunct wb and every show on upn. it was beat by all the shows on fox and of course by all the shows on abc, cbs and nbc.<br /><br />now, the hip hypesters are going to say: but this was a re-run. but everything on tv that week was pretty much a re-run! it boggles the mind why cw would choose this proved ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from upn.<br /><br />clearly something is going on behind the scenes. favors are being exchanged and influence peddled.<br /><br />sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? the "veronica mars has potential" line is clearly dead now that it's had two years to establish itself and failed to do so.<br /><br />maybe it's joel silver's influence and clout, but frankly, i am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their clout on a bad show that no audience is watching.<br /><br />a great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for cw.
