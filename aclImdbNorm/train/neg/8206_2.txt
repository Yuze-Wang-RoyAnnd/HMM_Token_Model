with one of my very favorite actors, james spader, i expected this film to be at least tolerable. it wasn't. after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. so trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each scene. one can even predict the dialogue word for word. this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say, "how did this movie ever get made?" in an effort to say something positive, i'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. but, on the whole, if you've seen 5 sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
