first of all, jenna jameson is the best actress in this movie, and she's just awful. this movie has every horror move clich'e in imagination, and all badly played. the over-sexed teen couple. the comical(not)horny jock. the snotty cool chick. the creepy local color guy. the parental-type couple. the virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films. the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool. it's almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner. i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago, but somehow, this just got worse. sure, the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat jameson's implants, but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog. avoid at all costs.
