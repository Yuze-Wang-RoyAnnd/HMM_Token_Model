this film concerns the story of eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community. the plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible. but this is inconsequential, as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized. screenplays not always need be 'chatty', but they should at least assist the development of the story. here one line attempts such as "he just took off" or "i know you don't have love in heart" just do fully evoke something worth the audience's time. also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music. talk about trying to hard. if you are interested in a good film, the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you.
