a group of us watched this film are were really disgusted. we were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character jo wasn't on (it's not like the writers/producers could do anything about that). the writing was poor, the script was sub-par. what really annoyed us: 1. when the two guys realized they were both dating natalie, they didn't just leave they put up with that stupid (and ultimately degrading) contest - but only because they were macho competing guys, not because they really wanted natalie. 2. despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion, natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy, it's as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film). 3. blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children, she blissfully agrees with him.
