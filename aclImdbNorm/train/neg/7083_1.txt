my husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense. (he never reads the synopsis).<br /><br />well, it would be funny if the thing was watchable. it simply isn't. the same thing over and over, no intrigue, and where did they find the leading man?. the leading man, michael des barres, is not even feasibly good-looking, especially for this role he is given. also, sexual harassment at work is something, if you want to see, rent michael crichton's "disclosure". at least michael douglas looked good in the early 90's. <br /><br />alexandra paul, who is usually watchable, plays an embarrassing scene here. there are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam. don't even waste time renting this. 0/10.
