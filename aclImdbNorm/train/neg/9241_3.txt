a few weeks ago the german broadcaster "sat1" advertised this movie as the "tv-event of the year" - sorry, but i've seen better things on tv this year.<br /><br />i didn't thought much of the movie but i soon reminisced about two other horrible movies when i watched the commercial - namely titanic and pearl harbor because the picture looked so familiar: the "heroine" (if i can really call her that) in the middle and her two "loved-ones" next to her - pearl harbor, anyone? in fact the love-story is a poor man's version of the one in pearl harbor and that one was already poor!<br /><br />but as i like watching movies and analyzing their patterns i eventually decided to watch that rubbish. the movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against russia near the end of the third reich promising his wife that he will return. now fast forward to spring 1948: germany lost the war and the allies & russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their ideologies: capitalism versus communism. well, i guess you already know the story because you have to know it - the movie doesn't really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts. the movie tries to depict the us government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially great britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that they're trying to help.<br /><br />what was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroine's mother tells her daughter that germany might be parted in two with a response like: "that's impossible!" or when stalin (where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he will look like him) says that russia has to stop "coca cola" from spreading in germany. yeah right, if stalin has ever said something like this. or there is this one us pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it - please! burgers were invented way before that time.<br /><br />in the movie you once see a map showing the airlines, funnily enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser printer - in '48. the us general lucius clay who's main idea was to stay in berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the airlift and improving on that idea came from the fictive character phillip turner, the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects: not enough african-american soldiers in the movie, there were like two in the whole film! also relationships between us soldiers and german civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the us soldier would've been sent home. i don't want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married, if it wasn't for the death of the pilot in his fake cgi plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the cgi fire!<br /><br />if it wasn't enough all americans in this movie spoke accent-free german although they only were in germany for a couple of months - look i'm also american living in germany for my whole life and even i have a little accent. notably bad was also the child acting - the kids had like two expressions on their faces: "normal-i-look-monotonous-like-a-robot" and grinning.<br /><br />all in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in pearl harbor just with half of the dialogue. the sad part is that the movie was very successful - 8.97 millions watched the first part and 7.83 millions the second part the day after thus sat1 receiving two consecutive wins in the overall market share and a whopping win in the commercial relevant group. but like i always think: the biggest pile of bull-crap is where the most flies go to.
