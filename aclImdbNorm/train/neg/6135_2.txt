america needs the best man possible to win "the game" so who do they hire? a gymnast (oh brother!) played by kurt thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game which involves ninjas, a village of crazies and richard norton who is told by kurt thomas "to keep his hardware in his pants." (his exact words) i missed this in theaters and it's a good reason because i would have probably been kicked out due to the laughing i broke into at regular intervals. the first thing that went through my mind was just how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass. kurt thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as "the best man for the job" as to the acting talent of kurt thomas, well if you can't say something nice... in all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to furnish an idea so stupid. only the decision to cast tara reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here. for 18 years though this held the title of the dumbest movie i had ever seen. not to say i didn't find this unwatchable, i was laughing so hard i almost choked to death. twice. only in the 80's could a movie with such a bad idea get made. although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so wimpy, he can't even pull a wedged sword out from the ground. this is the wimpiest action movie ever made, and one of the most hilarious also.<br /><br />* out of 4-(bad)
