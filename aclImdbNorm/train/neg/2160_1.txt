gods...where to start. i was only able to stomach about the first 10 minutes before i turned it off in disgust. aside from the actor playing robin hood himself, the rest were just terrible. and, i can only stretch my suspension of disbelief only so far.<br /><br />from the very opening of the first episode, i lost count of how many errors, plot holes, and horrible costumes there were. it began with some poor peasant trying to hunt for a deer to feed his family. all well and good. however, the poor blighter must have been mostly deaf, because a handful of soldiers, in full armour, on horseback, were able to sneak up on him to within about 10 feet.<br /><br />then, as he's running away, he goes from having them 10 feet behind him, to a shot where you cannot even see them at all, immediately followed by them about 20 feet behind him again. then, he runs into some bushes, and is immediately manhandled by two of the soldiers...who just mere seconds before, were galloping on horseback, dozens of feet behind him.<br /><br />the "armour" on the soldiers is so painfully obviously cloth which they tried to make look like maille, and miserably failed. not to mention, the lead soldier's "armour" being about 5 sizes too big for the poor fellow. seriously, he looks like he is a small child wearing his father's over-sized armour! finally, robin manages to fire about 5, perfectly aimed shots all around one soldier's hand, in the span of about 2 seconds, from what appears to be a recurve bow. no human alive could make those kinds of shots, in that short amount of time, with a scoped rifle, much less a bow.<br /><br />after that, they escape the soldiers and stop to help an amazingly well dressed and clean "peasant" with digging a ditch...something that all noblemen were willing to do all the time, right? how this sorry excuse for a series ever got a second season is beyond me. the production costs (at least for what i saw) must have soared in the dozens of dollars (or euros)...<br /><br />seriously - i think a highschool drama class could have put on a better rendition. this was so bad, even that terrible kevin costner version of robin hood was better.<br /><br />i highly suggest you skip this monstrosity, and go rent or buy the mid-80's "robin of sherwood" series. much better written, acted, costumed, and produced.<br /><br />for shame, bbc...for shame...
