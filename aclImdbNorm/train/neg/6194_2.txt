with a title "borrowed" from werner herzog and liberal helpings of kubrick, haneke and noe it is painfully obvious that thomas clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of rubbish our british cinema churns out. "robert carmichael" (for short) sets itself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the iraq war. the problem with the realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical - contrary to the fetid imaginings of "extreme" filmmakers most teenagers are not drug addled rapists. as a critique of the iraq war, a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - subtext society has damaged this sensitive individual)is so infantile as to hardly bear thinking about. there are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this. like kubrick and noe he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film. people liked "clockwork orange" and "irreversible" because they liked the rapes and the violence, but most of all they liked feeling culturally superior for liking things that most hated. so too much kubrick and not enough haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) here labels this as one of the most moronic films in years. (i am not against violence in film. to do it seriously is a hard trick though - people in cinemas cheered alex in "clockwork orange" showing how kubrick's supposed intent was missed by miles. gratuitous violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many art-film directors.)
