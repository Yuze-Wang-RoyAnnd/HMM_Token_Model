what do you expect when there is no script to begin with, and therefore nothing that the director can work with. hayek and farrell, and donaldson and kirkin are good actors, they just don't have anything to say or anything to react to. even the earthquake was pretty poor. and i don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but two have the jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes don't amount to anything. and he even buries camilla out in the desert, instead of bringing her back to l.a. for a nice catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. pathetic. and the l.a. set was ridiculously graphically created. anything good? the window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. and donaldson is always great. has been since the body snatchers or night of the living dead, whichever it was.
