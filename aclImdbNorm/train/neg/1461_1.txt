i saw that movie, and i was shocked! robert carlyle isn't hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be hitler. the movie lies, it doesn't reflect the truth. in the scene were hitler hit the guy with his gun. hitler never had hit anybody, he wouldn't hit people with his fist, but with the fists of soldiers. understand?? another thing is: it is too obvious, that hitler is that evil, he was more clever, than shown in this movie. no german would have accepted him as the leader, because the can see that he is evil. so the real hitler haven't shown his evil side to the people.<br /><br />have any of you yankees watched the movie "der untergang" or "the dawnfall"? this is a great movie, with amazing actors. and its a german movie. i think, this theme of nazi-germany, should not be realized as a movie by people who don't know anything of germany. people! watch "der untergang": <br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/<br /><br />its a great movie about a very sad period of time for human beings around the world.
