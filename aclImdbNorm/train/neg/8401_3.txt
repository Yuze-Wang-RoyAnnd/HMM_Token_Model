having just seen this on tmc, it's fresh in my mind. it's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars, they don't really run the show. first, they're broken into 2 groups - moe, as "shorty" and larry and curly as a pair of vagrants, so there's not a whole lot of full team work. the love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability, there's another group of musical stooges that are unfunny, unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish. the music is tiresome, they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses, the dorky western wear is silly, and there's an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera. by the way, this is obviously after curley's first stroke, and his reduced energy level is clear. vernon dent appears early on in an uncredited role. i loved everything these guys ever did, including all the non-curley stuff, but this little dogie is pretty lousy.
