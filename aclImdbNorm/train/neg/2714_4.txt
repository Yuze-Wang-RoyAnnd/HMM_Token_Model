the 60s (1999) d: mark piznarski. josh hamilton, julia stiles, jerry o'connell, jeremy sisto, jordana brewster, leonard roberts, bill smitrovich, annie corley, charles s. dutton. nbc mini-series (later released to video/dvd as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. the film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of dutton as reverend willie taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. however, dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. rating: 4 out of 10. not rated (later rated pg-13 for video/dvd release).
