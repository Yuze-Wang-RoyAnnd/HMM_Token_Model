great western i hear you all say! brilliant first effort! well i'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one i saw. great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none! the acting was poor to say the least and i couldn't care less about any of the characters, making the whole film pointless. the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to tv low budget rubbish like you see on those "fact or fiction" programmes on sci-fi.<br /><br />please, if you are looking for a good film, a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half, please look elsewhere.
