i like chris rock, but i feel he is wasted in this film. the idea of remaking heaven can wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely. when eddie murphy remade dr. doolittle and the nutty professor, he re-did them totally -- so they became murphy films/vehicles, not just tepid remakes. that's why they were successful. if chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. the few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine -- so he might as well have done a concert film. it also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly. so why does hollywood keep making junk like this? because people go to see it -- because they like chris rock. so give chris a decent script and give us better movies! don't remake films that weren't that good in the first place!
