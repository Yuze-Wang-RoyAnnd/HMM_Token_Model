i watched this today, partially attracted to the all-star cast and partly because i have enjoyed so many other films of this ilk. however, this is one to avoid. there are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity just does not flow, the billiards challenge at the start, for example. the fighting scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white tarzan movies, you know where you see a spear fly through the air and camera cuts to a dead native lying motionless on the floor with it sticking from his thigh. is that instantaneous death? there are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot, like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers. the really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch. if you do see this movie the crabs which inch forward at about 5kph are the highlight. somehow one manages to creep up on david mccullum and give him a nip. its as if there was no time to get out of the way, like when the obelisk in the city falls over, the native has all the time in the world to take a 2 step to the left, but no he screams and it falls on him. i only give this a 2 because of ekland. and why does mccullums voice develop a stutter as the movie progresses?
