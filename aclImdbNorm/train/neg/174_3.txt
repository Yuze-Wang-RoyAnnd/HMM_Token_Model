*possible spoiler*<br /><br />'return to cabin by the lake' is a useless movie. the acting was not good and the plot wasn't even remotely interesting.<br /><br />'cabin by the lake' is a good tv movie. the sequel was not. judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this. it seemed as if he wasn't even interested in doing the sequel. his acting was good but it could have been better. i really don't want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion, they're not even worth mentioning. but i'll do it. the character of alison isn't even hardly shown in the first part of the film. all of a sudden she's the center of attention next to stanley caldwell. the role didn't make sense and it should have been thought out a little better. dahlia salem was absolutely terrible. her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else, anybody else. the director, mike, was a confusing character. he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn't seem like his death was necessary. the acting for this role was good, nothing great but better than salem's.<br /><br />the plot was real lousy if you think about it. stanley, who is presumed dead, makes his way onto the set of 'cabin by the lake', the movie based on his script. he stumbles upon the director and in a short time, the director is dead and stanley is running the show. yeah, out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him. there's some killings, not a whole lot, and the one's that are shown are ridiculous. one of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene. another character gets chewed up by a motorboat. and one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning. these writers must have been hard up for excitement.<br /><br />i just have to say that i was not impressed with the filming of the movie. the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast. also, the new cabin by the lake was poorly created. we aren't shown it but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more, but it didn't work in this one.<br /><br />there were too many characters in this sequel. all of them except for a few had no reason to be there. the acting of what little is showed was really bad and...they just didn't have a purpose in this movie.<br /><br />all in all, 'return to cabin by the lake' is a sequel picking up from where the first left off. 'cabin by the lake' i can take but this was just not impressive. judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you. it's nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow. nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second. not to mention that the writing was horrible. put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep.<br /><br />so, we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well. by the way he talks, it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself. quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright!<br /><br />(did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one? they were all done in a tank. never, never reveal the secrets of filming.)<br /><br />
