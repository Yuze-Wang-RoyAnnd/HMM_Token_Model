lot of silly plot holes in the film. first we see him watching his master practice kung-fu, and die in the midst of his practice. that's fine with me. and then at the end of the film, we see him use the kung-fu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid. is that even possible? i don't think so.<br /><br />this show is purely for jay chou fans, and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development, cinematography styles and unfolding of plot.<br /><br />anybody notice that the captain of the basket team (forgot his name) and the idolized player li xiao look so similar to each other, to the extent that you'd think they were the one and same person? long hair, sunshine-boy look, tall and strong. the two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm. not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all.<br /><br />the jokes were lame and not funny at all.<br /><br />the scene with regards to the 4 masters of jay chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court, degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala royal rumble style. worse of all, when the 4 masters won the fight, the crowd began cheering, and the match continued. it was truly a wtf? moment.<br /><br />at the end of the show, when they win the match, all thanks to jay chou's excellent kung fu skills. how he acquired those kung-fu skills is a mystery, because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by observing his master.<br /><br />and then his long-lost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge jay chou as his long-lost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the film.<br /><br />in short, this is a jay chou-flick (instead of the usual "chick flick"). watch it only if jay chou is your fan. if you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those in the list of imdb's top 250 films of all time, then this film is not for you.
