as some other comments show, this movie might scare you, when you're a little child. (and that is probably all that it is good for.)<br /><br />however, if you're older, this movie only does one thing: suck majorly -and thereby i don't mean the acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. like that. i'm simply talking about the "plot" (if you can call it that). <br /><br />spoilers ahead ------------------------<br /><br />i don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary (if after reading this, you really still want to watch this movie) but if you graduated from any school, this is just a big insult of your intelligence. when watching this, i was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was just that stupid.<br /><br />this includes:<br /><br />-the forming of unite (an evil un-association) <br /><br />--> we are just supposed to believe it's evil. is it even evil at all? if so: why is it evil?<br /><br />-the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /><br />--> there is no necessity to impose this on the people, so why the hell (no pun intended) are they doing it? <br /><br />-inviting christ to your heart merely as lip service <br /><br />-->because there's nothing anybody, who in this movie is considered "a real christian", ever does, besides saying that stupid prayer. so...just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved - no matter what?! <br /><br />thus, rating 1/10
