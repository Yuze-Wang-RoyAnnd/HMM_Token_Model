this movie is an abomination, and its making should have been considered a capital crime.<br /><br />one of the great mysteries of film-making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery. it is a tale of a really gripping mystery, nice old-fashioned romance, and dry english humor. why did the makers have to change richard gordon from a scotland yard policeman to an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his english servant, change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of gordon's struggle to save the accused, etc., etc.? these producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person's product.
