honestly, i can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short. what i will say is that, alone in the dark succeeds in only three things: 1. it will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. it manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them.<br /><br />and<br /><br />3. it utterly disgraces the classic pc game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film-making.<br /><br />doctor boll, if that is indeed what you are (i'm thinking proctology here), what on earth are you doing in a director's chair?
