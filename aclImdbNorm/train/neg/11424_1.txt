i noticed "fire" was on cable the other night and i began watching it because i couldn't recall anything specific about it other than i remember it being a horrible film when i saw it back in '85. twenty years later the film is still awful. besides the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as is evident in the title song. hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them. and to compound this musical assault rob lowe's character played saxophone, and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was charlie parker, only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo. all the characters were intensely unappealing, although i must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them. actually i thought mare winningham was appealing, and i initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear, but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with rob lowe's character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon.
