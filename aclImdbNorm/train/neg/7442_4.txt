sorry this movie did not scare me it just annoyed me. it was just so frustrating when i saw the potential and that, all that, fell by the wayside. the children! the father! the premonition! had so much potential and ziltch! zero, nada! i have heard it all before. scary! no! i can scare myself alone, here where i sit, than they could in the movie. are there men writing that figure that women should be so annoying? huh? this movie was quite atmospheric. or at least it could have been, had the director/writer bothered to work it. we could have had some good music that would have added to the tension too, if someone had made the effort. what i really want to know is why do they get the money? just give it to me and save all that hassle. abandoned?... no we where betrayed
