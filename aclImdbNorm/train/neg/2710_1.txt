somehow they summed up the 60's, ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. and what a painful four hours it was. they trivilized the major events and happenings and they "claimed" it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family. if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash. what was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways, but managed to attend every major 60's event through the country. and the second family was such a non-factor. they devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family. that poor son... please nbc, do not make any movies about any other eras....leave that to pbs and the history channel
