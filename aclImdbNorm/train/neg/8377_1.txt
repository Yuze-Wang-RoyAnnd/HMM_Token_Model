this is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless . . . because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother!<br /><br />this film is even worse than white chicks! little man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby. story is awful considering it was written by six people. the idea still wouldn't be too bad though, if it was original and not a rip-off of a cartoon episode. it has funny moments but some of them are way over-done and some are just stupid. the acting was very, very bad. so was the directing. anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves. it is racist and very offensive to midgets. i mean, instead of showing sympathy to them, the film-makers make fun of them! it really disgusts me how they do it. they see midgets being just like babies. and for a character who is a midget, pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family. that is its lame excuse for showing something like that. it just was not worth it. don't watch this film. it is a huge waste of time and money.
