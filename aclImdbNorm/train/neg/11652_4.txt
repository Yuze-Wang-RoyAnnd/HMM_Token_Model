the script for "scary movie 2" just wasn't ready to go. this is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident, to the actors and the audience alike. director keenan ivory wayans, and many of the actors are funny people; and so the movie isn't completely humorless. to their credit, the film has several funny moments. but as a whole, "scary movie 2" is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original.<br /><br />the first "scary movie" was a laugh a minute film. it turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold. the humor in "scary movie 2" is as heavy handed as it is un-original. they even miss obvious opportunities for parody. two of the movies stars are former cast members of "beverly hills 90210," and this was a show that was begging to be parodied! in the final analysis, "scary movie 2" is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon. the script needed a lot more time to age. 2 stars out of 5.
