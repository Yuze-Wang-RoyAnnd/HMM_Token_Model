being a fan of the manga and anime of go nagai (devil man, devil lady, violence jack, etc.), i was looking forward to this one. i'd seen neither the manga nor the anime, so i had no preconceived notions going in. good thing, too. what we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the type that used to turn up with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night. while it's tame compared to what gets rammed down the throats of regular cable viewers (our hero's naughty bits are either tastefully tucked away behind a strategically glued-on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for the kiddies. while i have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes, i do dislike amateurishly made movies (there are at least four in this series). on the plus side, there's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes i saw. it's no wonder nagai's testicle boy never made it...
