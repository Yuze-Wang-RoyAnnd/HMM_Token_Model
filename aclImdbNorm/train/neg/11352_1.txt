this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic american) to write a story of a moon trip. absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities maybe it held some fascination in the 3d dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while. save your time and money and watch bolt instead<br /><br />damn. not enough lines, yet i feel that sums it up... well, i agree with an above review - this is like a cold-war propaganda story. maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute. btw - why were all the main character flies deformed? - not one had the full compliment of limbs!
