ok, i first saw this movie like at 9:00 on cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be award winning, boy was i 180d on that. this movie bit the big one. i mean, the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the end of the movie. i'm going " that's it? why doesn't she show it briefly a little bit more earlier in the movie." the plot being the mother and son feast on the blood of young women. wouldn't it be better if they just went on, you know, a killing spree killing like a couple of young women each, then having the sheriff or a cop find out about and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters,save the young woman/women, and have 1 or 2 more people killed in the process? i think it would be a hell of a lot better that way. it also sucks because the son is the main character and he gets killed first. why not get rid of the mother first? plus, how does she have that strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people? she said it herself she was too weak. what the heck was wrong with stephen this time? i can never, ever dis the acting on any movie by any actor, after all, they try their best. if it weren't for good acting, i'd have given this movie a 1/10. 3/10.
