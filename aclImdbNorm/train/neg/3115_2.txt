i rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time felt complied to. night listener is without doubt one of the dullest films i have ever seen.<br /><br />there was nothing happening in this film what so ever - i didn't care for any of the characters, didn't buy in to the whole mystery type plot, didn't care how it ended....nothing.<br /><br />there is no comedy, no action, no thrills, no suspense, nothing. the highlights include (no spoilers - there's nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it's horn.<br /><br />i really enjoyed "one hour photo" and hoped for a similar eerie role from williams, but alas was sorely let down. what's more disappointing is that i'm sure there is a good film in there somewhere - the idea was interesting and i should have felt sympathy for the characters, but it just didn't work for me.<br /><br />i might even have given it 1/10 but that score is reserved for the remake of the producers
