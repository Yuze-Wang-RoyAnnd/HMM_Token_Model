what a huge pile of dung. shot-on-video (really crappy camcorder, not digital) pile of garbage. it is without a doubt, the stupidest thing ever made. the fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine. everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it. seriously. i felt like it killed several brain cells after i watched this garbage. the positive reviews of this a$$crap were obviously made by the "filmmaker" (and i use the term very loosely) himself and/or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life. trust me, stay the hell away from this video. you'll thank me for it. avoid it like herpes.
