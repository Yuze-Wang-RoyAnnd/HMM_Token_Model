extremities <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />sound format: mono<br /><br />a woman turns the tables on a would-be rapist when he mounts an assault in her home, and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police, in which case he could be released and attack her again.<br /><br />exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough 'n' ready rape fantasy in the style of day of the woman (1978) will almost certainly be disappointed by extremities. true, farrah fawcett's character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker (a suitably slimy james russo), but scriptwriter william mastrosimone and director robert m. young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production. would their final solution hold up in a court of law? maybe...<br /><br />based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance, the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action. acing and technical credits are fine, though fawcett's overly subdued performance won't play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation.
