after seeing the poster from the film smother,i knew i was about to live one of those intolerable film experiences which make me want to take my eyes out.however,i felt a slight optimism because the movie had a solid cast which i thought it was going to rescue the movie.unfortunately that did not happen.smother is a horrible movie,but it is not execrable.that is the best i can say about it.<br /><br />the screenplay from smother (written by the same guys from license to wed,something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor.seriously,i did not laugh even once watching this film.besides,the solid cast i previously mentioned is absolutely wasted.after the big number of garbage she has been involved in (like the monumentally atrocious and execrable because i said so),some people may think the career from diane keaton is extinguishing.however,it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades,on films like annie hall or baby boom.on smother,she makes her best effort with her performance,but her character is so horribly written she cannot do anything with it.dax shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films baby mama and idiocracy.however,he does what he can with his character.mike white also makes a good effort,but he does not reach too far away.he is a very talented screenwriter (like he has shown on films like the good girl and school of rock),so i would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie,instead of only acting on it.liv tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors : being wasted.<br /><br />the worst fail from smother is being absolutely boring and unfunny.its screenplay is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we have seen on sit-coms.stay far away from this crappy comedy.
