if it wasn't for the performances of barry diamond and art evans as the clueless stoners, i would have no reason to recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />the plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion, which takes place in a supposed abandon high school(looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick), and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on. this student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge.<br /><br />john hughes falls in love with his characters too much, as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady(goonies' anne ramsey). we're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed, but never see a blasted thing! this is a horrible movie that continued national lampoon's downward spiral throughout the 80s and 90s.
