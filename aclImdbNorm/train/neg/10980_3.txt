a truly frightening film. feels as if it were made in the early '90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good, normal, mainstream-aspiring people. retrograde to the point of being offensive, ltr suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad, lonely, sex-crazed gays. wow! who knew? the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (the effeminate buffoon, the bitter, lonely queen, the fag hag, etc.) and the main characters are milquetoast, middle-class, middlebrow clones, of little interest.<br /><br />as far as the romantic & ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned, there's not much to say: we've seen it all before, and done much better.
