granted, i'm not the connoisseur d'horror my partner is, but a well put together, clever flick is worth the time. my quibbles, in brief:<br /><br />- dialog often weak and at times unbelievable coming from the given character.<br /><br />- unconvincing acting.<br /><br />- storyline never really caught fire.<br /><br />the writers plucked choice bits from half a dozen mainstream films, tossed into a kettle, simmered not nearly enough and tried feeding us poor saps the resulting mess, al'dente.<br /><br />long and short, while not absolutely terrible, it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my netflix rentals.
