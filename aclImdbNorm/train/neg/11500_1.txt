this move is slow, plodding, cold, dark, and without a plot or hope. it follows that tried and true european formula that they love to subsidize, that is never seen, but that the critics think makes an "important point".<br /><br />the movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between americans and europeans regarding employment. in this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it's the government's duty to provide them with work. whereas in the u.s. we know we have to go out there and create value for someone.<br /><br />spain never looked so backward!
