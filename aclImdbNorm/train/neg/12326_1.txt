a woman (sylvia kristel) seduces a 15 year old boy (eric brown). they have sex...but it's all tied into some stupid plot or something.<br /><br />easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation? i suppose it's ok cause it's a teenage boy--if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would (rightfully) be outrage. sorry, but having it done to a boy doesn't excuse it. it's still sick. i realize brown was of age (he was actually 18 when this was made) but he looks 15. i just find it disturbing that some people find this ok.<br /><br />plot aside the acting sucks (kristel is beautiful--but can't act; brown is easily one of the worst child actors i've ever seen) and the constant nudity gets boring and isn't even remotely erotic.<br /><br />i saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981. i was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin (who could easily pass for 18). he wanted to see it--i didn't but i decided what the heck? we got in and i actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage. my cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through! let me make this clear--three teenage boys left a movie with tons of female nudity! that should give you an idea of how bad this is. i'm surprised this was ever released. a 1 all the way.
