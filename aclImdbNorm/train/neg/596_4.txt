basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970's classic kitsch horror 'death line' which ironically was like this cobblers, also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station.<br /><br />making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych, this film contains basically the same plot - dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train - originality is not this film's strong point.<br /><br />indeed strong points are sadly lacking. the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub-gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device.<br /><br />franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often, indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film, out-acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats.<br /><br />if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag, or you just want to play 'spot the tube location' them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin. if you are looking for classic horror, go and dig up a copy of death line (aka raw meat).<br /><br />if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film, you will need to change trains.....
