of all the movies i've seen, this one rates almost at the bottom (haunted mansion, nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom.) it is hasty, the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted. of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous, and illogical. oprah gives a palatable appearance as "bigger's" mom, but is not nearly at her potential. other famous performers also seem to be at their worst. the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. so when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins caterwauling. the blind mother (yes) hears this, so bigger tries to silence her, but instead smothers her. now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves her into the coal furnace. so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom. if your desperate for a bad movie, this one could do the job, but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40's and 50's or see a good drama, there are a lot better options. avoid this.
