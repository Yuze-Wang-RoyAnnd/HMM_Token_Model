....cause it's crap! the kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say "why?". horrible camera work...count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can't. the dialog is ridiculous. the acting is comical. it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible. i'd bet $10 they used home video cameras to make this. either that, or most of the cameramen were drunk. truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie. if you ever want to host a "worst movie party", bring this one. want more entertainment...stare at a wall.
