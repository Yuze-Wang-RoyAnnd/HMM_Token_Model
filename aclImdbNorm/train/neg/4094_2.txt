despite being released on dvd by blue underground some five years ago, i have never come across this italian "sword and sorcery" item on late-night italian tv and, now that i have seen it for myself, i know exactly why. not because of its director's typical predilection for extreme gore (of which there is some examples to be sure) or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time (it is set in the dark ages after all)
