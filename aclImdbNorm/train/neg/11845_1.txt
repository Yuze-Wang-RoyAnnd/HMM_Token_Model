...is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. kirsten dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star marion davies like she thinks she's in "legally blonde." the guy who plays william randolph hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him. eddie izzard is pretty good, except that he's playing charlie chaplin, and is about, oh, 125 lbs too heavy for the part? hard to believe this hamfisted, uneven wreck was directed by peter bogdanovich, but then again, he hasn't made a watchable movie in, what? 30 years? sometimes, there's just no coming back.
