the american humane association, which is the source of the familiar disclaimer "no animals were harmed..." (the registered trademark of the aha), began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film jesse james (1939). needless to say, the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me. i suppose one could say that at least the horse didn't die in vain, since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making, but i can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this sure wouldn't have been the path he would have taken!
