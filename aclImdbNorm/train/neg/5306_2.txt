ok, i am blessed. i have seen two very strong stage productions, the one in new york with the original cast, and another at the san diego rep (rosina reynolds and monique gaffney, you rock!). compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable. i've been plodding through the dvd for the past two evenings and am still not finished. way too much extraneous dialog, and waaay too many added scenes and people. yes, the four major performances are quite good, esp. ms. streep's. but comparing stage to film is definitely an example of "less is more." the thickening of the play to satisfy film-goers' need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice. please, please, please go find a stage production somewhere near you.
