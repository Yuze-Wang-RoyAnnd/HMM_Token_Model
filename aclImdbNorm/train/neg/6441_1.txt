when i looked at this years wrestlemania's match card, i was so stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement.<br /><br />it starts...and it ends.<br /><br />i'm sitting there, angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back. i mean, you watch wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then. the one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when hbk tapped out!!!! that very moment of hbk losing to john cena!!!!!!!!!! john cena is such a loser/poser. it almost ruined wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat triple h! i couldn't watch wwe after seeing wrestlemania 23. i'm starting to watch it again (luckily). i again have faith in wwe after wrestlemania 24 (the greatest i have ever seen) which was a pure classic wrestlemania. it definitely made up for 'mania 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as well.<br /><br />if you have watched any of the wrestlemanias before this one, like the ones that turn you into fans (wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), please don't watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave wwe behind. and if you do watch it and are angry, start watching it again and watch wrestlemania 24, it is absolutely classic.
