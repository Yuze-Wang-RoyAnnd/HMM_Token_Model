going into a movie like i this, i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills.....what i got was even less.<br /><br />christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit. horrified, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. the story begins 33 years later and harry stalling is your normal everyday joe.....cept for the fact he's obsessed with santa. after his boss makes fun of him he goes insane, dressing up like santa and starts killing non-santa believing patrons and his boss. an unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they're about to torch him, he drives his van off a cliff.....into the moon. not the best ending i've seen but it was original.<br /><br />it was a slow paced, boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when harry went apeshyt on the church goers. there was hardly any gore and even the "sex" scenes were toned down.<br /><br />too boring......4 out of 10
