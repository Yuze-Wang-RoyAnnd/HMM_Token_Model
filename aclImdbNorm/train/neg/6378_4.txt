this movie was amusing at times, hell sometimes it was even downright funny.<br /><br />the underlying message i got from the film though, was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man. every time a woman is depicted in the film, she is being lazy, being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason. i don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men.<br /><br />but, it is a comedy, and a piece of art, so it is simply someones point of view. even if i don't agree with it, they are still entitled to it.<br /><br />an amusing film, but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid. best film ever my foot.
