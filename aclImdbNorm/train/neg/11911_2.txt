i sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, yet keeping an attentive eye. i waited for the next awful special effect, or the next ridiculously clich'ed plot item to show up full force, so i could learn how not to make a movie.<br /><br />it seems when they set out to make this movie, the crew watched every single other action/science-fiction/shoot-em-up/good vs. evil movie ever made, and saw cool things and said: "hey, we can do that." for example, the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking, is the one car the protagonist, an attractive brunette born of bile, is thrown on to. the car blows to pieces before she even lands on it. the special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie. but what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility, and lack of reason for so many elements! for example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways, happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important vip. nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck, you know they are already dead. then the guy protecting the vip says "under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" he gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies, he gets whacked in an almost comically clich'e fashion. then for no apparent reason, defying logic, convention, and common sense, the dumb ass vip gets out of the truck!!! a lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn't make sense. transparent acting distanced me from the movie, as well as bad camera-work, and things that just make you go: "wow, that's incredibly cheesy." shiri appleby saved the movie from a 1, because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeal.
