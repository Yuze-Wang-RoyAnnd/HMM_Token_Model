the animation was good, the imagery was good, although not totally original, however, the story was too long, way too confusing, and over the top dramatic. after about an hour i couldn't wait to get it over with. with so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn't one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies. if you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it, but frankly, i've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell. go rent a miyazaki film and watch it twice, you'll get way more out of it.
