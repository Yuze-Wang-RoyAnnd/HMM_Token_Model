okay, the story makes no sense, the characters lack any dimensionally, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of movie, the cinematography is dismal, and only editing saves a bit of the muddle, but sam" peckinpah directed the film. somehow, his direction is not enough. for those who appreciate peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a disappointment. even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort.<br /><br />the proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director san peckinpah, james caan, robert duvall, burt young, bo hopkins, arthur hill, and even gig young bring to their work. watch the great peckinpah films. skip this mess.
