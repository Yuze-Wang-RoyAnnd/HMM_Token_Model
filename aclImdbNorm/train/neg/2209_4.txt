if you read my review of syfy's "dinoshark", you know that i can appreciate the low-budget schlock that these made-for-television movies can provide. they're stupid...they're silly...but they're still pretty fun in a "so bad, it's good" kind of way. so, still smacking with guilt for liking (and recommending) the undeniably hokey "dinoshark", i sat down to watch "hammerhead: shark frenzy", a syfy original movie about a half-man, half-hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island. with the syfy channel's sure-fire recipe for creating b-movie creature features and a cast that includes william forsythe and hunter tylo, how could it possibly go wrong? well, to my surprise, it actually misses the mark...not by much, but enough to make me not recommend it. why? well, first of all, its titular monster, the dreaded hammerhead-human hybrid, takes a backseat to a bunch of faux-military thugs who really become the movie's primary villain. though the hammerhead does rack up the body count, he (or it or whatever you call the thing) only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after. the rest of the movie is filler, pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. that, to me, is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people! <br /><br />please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
