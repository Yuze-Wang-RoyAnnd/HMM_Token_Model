i want to start by stating i am a republican, even though i don't agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office. and i love the daily show and colbert report. they have to be two of my favorite shows on tv. i enjoy the bush jokes on conan, letterman, leno, because i admit that w is not the smartest guy to ever walk the earth(i do believe he's not the dumbest either.) but it comes to a point when enough is enough and it's not really that funny anymore. i see where it can be funny and it is(hey he's making fun of our authority figure he's hilarious.). comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him. i mean maybe one special episode, but an entire series is just dumb. it seems cc is just saying the same bush jokes that we've heard way to many times. i really cannot see this show going past 1 season.
