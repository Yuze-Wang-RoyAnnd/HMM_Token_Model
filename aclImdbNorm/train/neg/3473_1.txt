this is quite possibly the worst christmas film ever. the plot is virtually non-existent, the acting (affleck in particular) is poor at best. ben affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree. as far as i could gather the plot consisted of ben affleck, a millionaire salesman, is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. on doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for christmas... and that is it. the film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family.... blah blah blah.
