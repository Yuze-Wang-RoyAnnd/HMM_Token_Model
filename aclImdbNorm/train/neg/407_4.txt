i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real. the special effects of this movie are very good. i have seen most of this movie, since it's been airing on hbo for the past couple of months. i must admit, i may have missed a few scenes, but i'm usually drawn into movies, and have seen some scenes more than once. but every time i see some of "hollow man," i feel depressed, almost like a "film noir." i'm not sure why; perhaps it's that i don't want kevin bacon to be evil, and there's disappointment in that. but i think it's witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes. regardless, i can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 (perhaps 12, if they are mature).
