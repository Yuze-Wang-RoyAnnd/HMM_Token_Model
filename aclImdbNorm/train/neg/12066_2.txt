ok, how's this for original- this mean, rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children, all of them ungrateful losers, and two creepy servants, provided they spend the week in his spooky old house. what happens that night will surprise only those who haven't seen a movie or television show before. after a string of murders in which the victims look like they're bleeding restaurant ketchup, we have a painfully obvious twist ending. the cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks. there are also a few second-tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now. as a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of "matlock." i will give credit where it's due- the closing scene is clever and amusing, if you're still awake.
