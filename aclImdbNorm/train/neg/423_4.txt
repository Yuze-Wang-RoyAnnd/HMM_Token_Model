i don't know why, but after all the hype on npr i thought this was a new movie.....all the best footage has been used for bbc docs and natgeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs...it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over-dramatic music for disney to take advantage of earth day-there are great moments, and it is always nice to listen to darth vader.......oops,........... james earl jones speak, but i had hoped for a ground breaking movie , considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film......it has been sanitized for a child audience, so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube ....i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is certainly not it
