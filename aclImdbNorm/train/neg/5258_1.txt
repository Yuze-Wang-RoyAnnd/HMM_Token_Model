well, i rented this movie and found out it realllllllly sucks. it is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family,then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie ,and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees, etc etc etc..... they go to that town which no one know it exists (blah blah blah) and the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you don't understand what is that movie!!!!i have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst, honestly it doesn't have a description at all and i wish i didn't see it.
