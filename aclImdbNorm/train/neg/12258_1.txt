an mtv-style film crew consisting of american t.v. programme producer zack zardine (matt borlenghi) his camerawoman, the australian cecily (kate fisher) and two surfer 'dudes' named bog hall (dax miller) and jeremy (joel west) arrive on some nice looking island somewhere, it's not actually revealed where. the crew plan to shoot an expose on 'bloodsurfing' which is apparently the latest craze in extreme sports. surfers throw bait into the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks, just to see if they can out-surf them without being eaten. once there they are greeted by sonny lofranco (cris vertido) and his wife melba (susan africa). their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of lilo-cay. sonny, melba and their daughter lemmya (maureen larrazabal) take them in their boat. soon after arriving and having already shot some 'bloodsurfing' footage sonny, melba and lemmya are all killed by a 30 foot saltwater crocodile that some say 'owns' the island. the boat is sunk. zack, cecily, bog and jeremy appear stuck on the island until such time a rescue party arrives. however, after a run in with some, erm well i don't really know what they are. pirates? drug smugglers? revolutionairies? fat ugly people who just don't like being with other people? who knows? and more importantly who cares? not me that's for sure. anyway, after escaping from these guys who look like pirates, they are picked up just off the coast of the island by captain john dirks (duncan regehr) and his girl arty (taryn reif as tara reif). the film crew believe they have been saved. little do they know that the crocodile and captain dirks go way back and he has a score to settle and four members of a film crew aren't going to stop him. captain dirks heads back to lilo-cay for a final showdown with the giant man-eating crocodile.<br /><br />directed by james d.r. hickox this is one awful film, but it's still not as bad as tobe hoopers crocodile (2000). everything about this film sucks. the script by sam bernard and robert l.levy is terrible, extremely slow as the crocodile isn't even seen or mentioned before the 30 minute mark and by that time i was seriously bored and annoyed with the hideously unlikeable characters thought up by bernard and levy. the whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well, within the first 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who will survive. the crocodile effects are awful and seem to be repeated over and over, there is a small puppet head that obviously has someones arm stuck inside it controlling it's movements as the water splashes become huge! the cgi shots of the crocodile are just plain embarrassing to watch. there is no gore apart from when a character is bitten in half which is achieved using cgi to digitally remove the actors legs, again it looks terrible. there is also a brief scene when someone is impaled on wooden spikes when they set a trap off. there is a reasonable amount of nudity and sex, plus the female actresses are nice and easy on the eye. there are basic continuity and logical errors in the film too, in one sequence cecily is filming bog and jeremy 'bloodsurfing' but from the angle and distance she is at it would be physically impossible to obtain footage of both the sharks and surfers at the same time, and surely that is the whole point of her shot? when dirks manages to harpoon the crocodile the angle of the wire changes dramatically between shots, in one shot the angle of the line looks like it's coming from the sky, in the shot straight after the angle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surface of the water when in actual fact the harpoon is attached to the back of the boat and the line should be almost level with the surface. i could carry on, like why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if it's so smart as this film tries to make out? but i would probably exceed the 1000 word limit if i listed everything that was wrong with this film, so i won't. i hated this film, but rather scarily it's still not as bad as tobe hoopers effort at a giant crocodile film. definitely one to avoid.
