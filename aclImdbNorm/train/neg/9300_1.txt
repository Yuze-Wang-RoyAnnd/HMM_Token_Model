spoiler alert well i think this movie is probably the worst film ever made. probably in the style of ed wood(without the heart). the lightning is terrible. the music is very bad(piano and orgue... come on!). the acting is... well there is no acting!<br /><br />there's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger.<br /><br />the killer is a fat, unscary clown who couldn't outrun a turtle!<br /><br />every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clich'es of slashers movies in the film without effort.<br /><br />the end is so far the most stupid ever made. think about it: the guy(ken hebert) who's acting skill is about the same as his writing(he's the brain behind this flop) invite a co-worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week-end and kills them... on monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen.<br /><br />the tragedy is that mr.hebert try to make us beleive that it's a family affair that goes on for generation(his uncle is the clown killer)<br /><br />so of course no cops are gonna question him after his co-worker goes missing...<br /><br />whatever.<br /><br />
