i found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible.<br /><br />the only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was lacy chabert's performance who i thought played the multiple personalities really well. for me she was definitely the highlight of this movie.<br /><br />dina meyer was pretty as always but i found her role pretty bland so i don't think one can say that her acting was great.<br /><br />as for the male lead, armand assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series.<br /><br />all of that i could have lived with. however the terrible, terrible, terrible end/solution, the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing i have seen in a long time.
