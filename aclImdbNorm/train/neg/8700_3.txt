i really hope that concorde/new horizons wasn't trying to make a serious horror, or even action movie when they made carnosaur 3. the movie is flat-out silly from start to finish. even the humor in c3 is funny because it's bad. definitely a high water mark in the 'so bad it's good' genre. if you enjoy the very worst of the worst, this is for you.
