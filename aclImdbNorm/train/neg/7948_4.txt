"the seventh sign" borrows a lot from "rosemary's baby" and "the omen" (it actually blends the two stories).even its title recalls bergman' s "the seventh seal" .<br /><br />nevertheless,it begins well enough,with all the omens scattered on the whole earth,and in parallel ,a -seemingly- distinct plot with moore's husband trying to save a poor boy (who killed his parents who were brother and sister)from death penalty.this time,both christian and jewish religions are called to the rescue (even the wandering jew is involved),which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny (have you ever been to sunday school? but they taught me that god was love!).the best scene imho ,is the short dialog between priest john heard -who does not seem to take things seriously ,too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid-back acting is priceless-and the young jew.<br /><br />demi moore probably registered the same desire as ex-husband bruce willis :saving the world.she does not save the movie for all that.
