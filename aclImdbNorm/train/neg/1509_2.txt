i really have problems rating this movie. it is directed brilliantly, there is obviously a lot of money in it. gere and danes are intense (although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up), editing and cinematography are excellent. on the other hand, it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes, and, yes, one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire.<br /><br />in purely artistic terms, it is a 9, but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie ....
