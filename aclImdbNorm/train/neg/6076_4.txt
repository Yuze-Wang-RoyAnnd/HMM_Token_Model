in the fan robert de niro plays gil renard . or is it travis bickle ? or rupert pupkin ? or max cady ? you see the problem with this type of role is that de niro has played very very similar characters in taxi driver , the king of comedy and cape fear and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts . i found it slightly difficult to believe that renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psycho<br /><br />the character arc isn't the only problem with this script - it also lacks a character focus ( a problem i had with the untouchables where de niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat ) , for several stretches of the movie i kept thinking that bobby rayburn was the main character then the story switches back to renard . it also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball . i'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans originally but again there are elements which hint it might have if the producers had made up their minds has to who and what the story should focus upon <br /><br />i will admit i was entertained by the fan ( especially by the soundtrack ) but it is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that by the mid 1990s characters being stalked by nutters as in single white female , unlawful entry etc had run out of steam a long time ago
