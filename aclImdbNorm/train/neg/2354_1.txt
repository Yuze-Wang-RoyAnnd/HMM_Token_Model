i do not even want to call this thing a film - it is a movie that should not have won any awards. the acting was horrible as were the silly scenarios. this is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an nri audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the movie. <br /><br />i find it strange that so many actors conversant with the english language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. i'm sure many readers know what i am talking about - all those token english phrases thrown into a movie, in hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. there are few indian movies in which the english seems completely genuine - being cyrus was a recent one. although not a great film, it was a good film and the language did not seem "put on". <br /><br />i feel ashamed that p3 was awarded the nfa in 2005. the only semi-enjoyable parts of this rubbish were konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. other than that, do not even waste your time with this film.
