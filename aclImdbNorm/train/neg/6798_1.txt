this is the worst movie i have ever seen. everyone involved should be embarrassed. everyone. ice-t is pitiful, the dialogue is absolutely awful, and hokie does not begin to describe the performances by every single actor in this movie. the plot steals heavily from executive decision, but compared to air rage, executive decision is academy award material. i have never been so disappointed when watching a movie. air rage should be burned with its ashes locked in a vault never to see the light of day again. anyone who has seen it should take a shower and wash the stink of horrible movie off of them. the best part of this movie probably comes from the ending, when the credits rolled. this was easily the worst movie i have ever seen. <br /><br />ice-t should stick to law and order, and the other people in this film should retire early or commit suicide. either way, they should never attempt to be in a movie again.
