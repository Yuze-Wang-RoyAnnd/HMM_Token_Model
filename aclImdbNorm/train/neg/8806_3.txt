how did this ripoff of "being there" ever get to be so loved? people say it's proof that a decent, honest man can succeed despite lack of intelligence. they're wrong. the movie is proof that luck is everything: hope your friend invests all your money in apple and not atari; hope your shrimp boat is the only one out at sea when a storm breaks; hope that you don't die of shock when you're luckily shot in the buttocks and not in the back; hope you don't get aids from your wife. this movie is also politically reactionary -- all who rebel against societal convention lose their legs, do drugs, beat their girlfriends, or die young. in addition, the product placement in this film (nike and dr. pepper) is shameless. an emotionally manipulative film that is very, very empty.
