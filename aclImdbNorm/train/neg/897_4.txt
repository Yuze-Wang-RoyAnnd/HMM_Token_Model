two years before he wrote and directed "arthur", steve gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedic vehicle for henry winkler, then tv's "the fonz". a 1950s college thespian (and all-around jerk) woos a co-ed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon; to make ends meet, he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling, eventually becoming a "gorgeous george"-like celebrity. turning likable winkler into an obnoxious goof-off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from his television alter-ego), but the jokes and situations are often wrong-headed and mean, staged rather sloppily by director carl reiner. particularly crude is a wincing bit involving herv'e villechaize (of "fantasy island") putting the moves on polly holliday (flo from "alice"). as henry's beloved, kim darby looks a little out of her element--particularly when surrounded by all these tv hams--rendering the romance aspect of the script inconsequential. *1/2 from ****
