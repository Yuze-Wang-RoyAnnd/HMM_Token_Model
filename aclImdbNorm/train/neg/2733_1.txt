i debated as to whether or not i should tick the spoiler box. since 99% of this show has probably already been seen by any follower of scrubs it probably doesn't come under the category of a spoiler.<br /><br />clip shows. grrr. we all knew friends was going down the tube when they started with clip shows...and five and a half years into scrubs they've gone and fallen down that hole.<br /><br />i have to wonder if the writers just couldn't be bothered writing that week and just said to themselves "let's show the other funny stuff." it didn't work.<br /><br />for starters, showing all the times that people have fallen down isn't funny when taken out of context. it's not funny to see todd dangling by his banana hammock unless we know why he was dangling by his banana hammock.<br /><br />second, for what was supposed to be a compilation of jd's fantasies, one was turk's dream, another also wasn't his fantasy, although i forget which.<br /><br />and that's the problem. this episode is totally forgettable. we've seen all these things before. and the collection of clips of people dancing? why? that's not funny.<br /><br />finally, i must admit two of my favourite scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation...dr. cox realising that ben died...and jd telling him how proud of him he is.<br /><br />but even seeing those moments again didn't save the episode. the summary says it all.<br /><br />worst episode ever. bill lawrence, please don't let your show go the same way as friends, keep it fresh, keep it funny...or wrap it up.
