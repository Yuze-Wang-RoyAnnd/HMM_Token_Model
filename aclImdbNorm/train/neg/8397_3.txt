after reading the previous comments, i'm just glad that i wasn't the only person left confused, especially by the last 20 minutes. john carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him. i anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior...naturally i assumed he had something to do with the evil goings-on at the house, but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse (hereafter referred to as zombie #1), these scenes made absolutely no sense. please, if someone out there knows why carradine kept climbing down into graves -- let the rest of us in on it!! <br /><br />all the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so i'll attempt a synopsis. john carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is throttled by zombie #1. so far, so good. but then we get the confusing scene where john ireland and jerry strickler, out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard, discover carradine's dead body. strickler repeatedly tries to push ireland into the open grave from whence zombie #1 had emerged, but ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead, and presto! strickler comes out as zombie #2! yeah, i guess we can infer that strickler was dead all-along (a witch?), but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting-flesh version by flying into zombie #1's grave is never explained. (considering how excruciatingly slow-moving these zombies are, i'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his "normal" form until his business was concluded). this scene also brings a question to mind -- just who the heck is zombie #1 ??? we can only assume zombie #1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie's opening credits, but who knows which one, nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew.<br /><br />anyway, after ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the exact same shot of zombie #2 shambling through the trees as we saw for zombie #1. (this leads to momentary confusion over just how many zombies there really are). then in best 1950's horror-movie fashion ireland manages to trip while fleeing. he conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of faith domergue's dead cat (wasn't that nice of john carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew?)<br /><br />meanwhile, zombie #1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house. he easily dispatches three film-crew members, then starts up the stairs. faith domergue hears him, and thinking it's lover john ireland back from his night-shoot, goes out. upon seeing it's only zombie #1, she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves ireland's revolver. while starlet carole wells is showering at this point and can't hear the scream, her co-star charles macauley (who's boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom) does. taking his sweet time (and only after some more swigs from his hip-flask) he finally decides to investigate. (one thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how slow to react the stars are to screams and gunshots). domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready, but mistakes macauley for zombie #1 and shoots him six times! he does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrified domergue backs up, right into the waiting arms of zombie #1.<br /><br />carole wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and domergue's screams; she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate. so during this time zombie #1 has time to string domergue up from the neck with a rope. wells sees domergue's hanging corpse and faints dead-away. the next time we see her is in a stream outside the house (???) -- but more on that later. meantime, ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers zombie #1's bloody carnage. though ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined! mercifully for him (and the audience), zombie #1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor. that's the last we see of zombie #1. at this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths, showing that the new ones "mirror" the old ones. how profound.<br /><br />zombie #2, meanwhile, has gotten near the house (remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in january) where he happens to see carole wells floating by in a stream, and fishes her out. how did she get there? did zombie #1 carry her down, throw her in, then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush john ireland? apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub, so wells has to drown too (but why outside in a stream, instead of in the tub, is never explained). zombie #2 never makes it into the house himself (everyone's dead by now, anyways, thanks to zombie #1) but instead he carries carol wells back to the graveyard. as the end credits flash on screen, we see zombie #2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave.<br /><br />the viewer is left wondering: yes, but wasn't this zombie #1's grave? why is zombie #2 taking up residence? and what if zombie #1 comes along and wants to climb back in -- is zombie #2 gonna let him, or will there be a zombie fight? will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased carole wells? and what about now-dead john carradine -- where's he gonna stay? after all, from the earlier scenes we know he's clearly at home in the grave... if this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused, don't worry cause you're not alone.
