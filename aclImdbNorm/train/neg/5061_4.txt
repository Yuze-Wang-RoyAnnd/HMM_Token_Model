anurag basu who co-directed the flop kucch to hai made his debut in this film <br /><br />the film was ahead of it's times in a way though it has a story not to different and it came closest to hawas which released 1 week before and luckily this was better and did a better business<br /><br />the movie starts off well, malika's guilt is well shown at the start though the scene with emraan- malika is too crude/vulgar<br /><br />the scenes between emraan and malika are well handled and the twist in the tale where ashmith confronts emraan is brilliant<br /><br />the pace moves fast and the viewer is kept on the edge but the second girlfriend track of emraan isn't fully convincing<br /><br />also the cop track seems half baked<br /><br />the finale is too filmy too<br /><br />direction by anurag basu is good music is a winner, all songs were fab camera-work was stunning<br /><br />emraan played his naughty streak very well, this was the role that gave him stardom and though he kept playing such roles and got annoying in this film he was superb ashmith too was good in his role for once, he did a nice job and one of his only good performance and he looked good too malika was brilliant in her role esp in the second half but her dial delivery was at times not up to the mark sadly rarely she showed such potential in other films raj jhutsi is okay
