lifetime did it again. can we say stupid? i couldn't wait for it to end. the plot was senseless. the acting was terrible! especially by the teenagers. the story has been played a thousand times! are we just desperate to give actors a job? the previews were attractive and i was really looking for a good thriller.once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isn't one of them. unless one has nothing else to do i would avoid this one at all cost. this was a waste of two hours of my life. can i get them back? i would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. that would have been more entertaining.
