the movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong shannon lee and introduces two very simpathetic side characters through the first half. but later something happens and all the sudden shannon turns into this straight faced, second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in it's own context. the second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clich'es, bad acting, a horrible plot and even worse stunt coordination. not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gang.<br /><br />"game of death 2" was bad and clownified bruce, but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played bruce lee back then. i truly believe that she can do much better than this and i hope she participates in a better production next time.<br /><br />if you are a real hard core action fan and don't care about quality go ahead and see this movie. i was personally looking forward to it but just got terribly disappointed.
