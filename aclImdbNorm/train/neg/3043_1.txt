this movie is supposed to be a "lighthearted" tale about santa claus and his "magical and mystical" wonders. but instead it comes off as being downright creepy. two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1) the way santa looks.- have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus? and 2) the "evil rep. of satan" pitch's just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch. only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh. i can't believe this is a children's movie.
