william lustig's followup to "maniac" proves conclusively that, without tom savini's spectacular effects and spinell's convincing performance, "maniac" would never have become the cult hit that it did. "vigilante" is badly directed, with a simple-minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn, and also mediocre performances by all the actors. judging from the sense of "deja vu" this film gave me, lustig had watched "death wish" several times too many before making this!
