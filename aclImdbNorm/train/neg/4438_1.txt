i borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful. how wrong am i!<br /><br />it is such a bad movie that i have to write something about it. mira sorvino is so bad in the movie, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. she is a pretty girl, but in this movie, she is not seductive at all, but i will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters. it is so ridiculous.<br /><br />and the dialog of the film is so pretentious, and lack the humorous fact that make then acceptable.<br /><br />totally failure.
