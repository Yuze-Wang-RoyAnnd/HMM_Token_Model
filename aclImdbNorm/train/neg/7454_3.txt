i like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly. danny glover does a good job making you wonder if he's the bad guy. meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. dennis quaid didn't have as much room in the story as he could have had. i thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded. i'd watch it again though. i rated it a 5 (wish i could rate it a 5.5)
