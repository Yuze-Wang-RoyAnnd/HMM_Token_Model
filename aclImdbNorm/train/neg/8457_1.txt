i only watched this movie because i was so impressed with olivier martinez in swat. but this is no swat. swat had a plot and some likable characters and made sense. bullfighter had none of these. <br /><br />i should have realized that it couldn't possibly be any good, after all, the always painfully bad michelle forbes had a starring role.<br /><br />one poster here called the movie incoherent. another called it the worst movie ever. both gave the movie far too much credit. i am so glad i got it from the library for free, yet i still feel ripped off.<br /><br />imdb needs to include a "0" in the "rate this film" vote, just for movies like this one.
