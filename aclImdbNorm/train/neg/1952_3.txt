scott menville is not casey kasem. that is the first, most important, and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re-imagining scooby-doo and company.<br /><br />shaggy's voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows. they've also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original.<br /><br />i'm not sure what they're on about yet with the villain angle, but it surely isn't following the formula used in any of the previous scooby shows.<br /><br />and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. i like it, but it's not real scooby-doo type animation. but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me; this might, too.<br /><br />it's worth a glance at -- once -- if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice. that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly. besides, i am trying not to be an inflexible, nitpicking fan. evolve or die, as the saying goes. we'll see how it looks after two more episodes -- by then i'll have formed a much more solid opinion.
