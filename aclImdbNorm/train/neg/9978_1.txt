my girlfriend and i were stunned by how bad this film was. after 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself. it didn't.<br /><br />i can't understand the praise given to this film. the writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />one thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines. i understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness (like in happiness). this was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing. this film might actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film, because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much.<br /><br />i generally like these types of small quirky films (the real blonde, walking and talking, lovely and amazing), but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years.
