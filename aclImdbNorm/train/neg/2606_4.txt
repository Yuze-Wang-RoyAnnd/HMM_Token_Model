drew barrymore plays young holly gooding, who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter patrick highsmith (george newbern) and completely disrupts his life by claiming that her "doppelganger", or evil twin, is out to kill her and her family.<br /><br />this silly horror film is kind of hard to take seriously, even if the film-makers and actors themselves seem to be dead serious. "doppelganger" is muddled, with some unpleasantly dumb dialog.<br /><br />some viewers will note that drew's character's name is drawn from audrey hepburn's role in "breakfast at tiffany's", and that newbern's character's name is a play on the name of famed author patricia highsmith (he is actually trying to re-write "breakfast" as a horror film, believe it or not!).<br /><br />i suppose that it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror film - i mean, writer/director avi nesher seems to genuinely care for his characters, and gives his film more plot than standard slasher fare.<br /><br />after a silly villain-explains-everything-to-the-audience confrontation, the film goes on to submit a hideous, out-there climax that has to be seen to be believed. this film certainly does not skimp on the gore.<br /><br />but hey! drew kills her mother in this one. no, i'm not joking. jaid barrymore shows up near the beginning only to get violently slaughtered.<br /><br />drew is always very watchable, and very sexy in this one. newbern comes off as a likable-enough, "nice" sort of guy. but the highpoint of the film has to be the scene with sally kellerman, an attractive veteran who's very professional in her one scene as a former nun who's started a phone sex business(!!!!!!).<br /><br />the film is basically junk but fairly amusing on a sleazy, sordid little level.<br /><br />4/10
