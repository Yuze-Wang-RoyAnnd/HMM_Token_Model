you know the story..pretty kids alone in the woods,when bam!something starts cutting them up.<br /><br />well this crap is no different.a bunch of kids return to a cabin where the male leads twin brother disappeared for years before.suddenly an "unkown creature" stars cutting them up,and their only help is a doctor/biker.<br /><br />to say this film was bad is an understatement,it's smut! the acting was horrible.<br /><br />the creature looked very cheesy. and as all films do these days they try to get you with a twist ending,which they do not!<br /><br />there is one bright spot to this film- lost star maggie grace as the female lead.
