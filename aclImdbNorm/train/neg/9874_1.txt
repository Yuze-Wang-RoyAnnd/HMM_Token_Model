a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do. that being stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem "solved". they are of course "out foxed" at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land.<br /><br />the"film" version ,and i use the term film very loosely, is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movies particularly the oceans movies. they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely. so kudos to them .they'll make lots of money and destroy another classic roald dahl children book.
