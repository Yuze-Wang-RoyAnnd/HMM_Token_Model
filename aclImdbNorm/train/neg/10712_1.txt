this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever, i emphasize, ever made. what's worse, my old hero dolph is in it and he's starring it. jesus... the story is actually quite good but the way it's carried out made even my body hurt. the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter. the actors, except for dolph who kinda sucks also, perform so badly you can't help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they're all friends of the director, who by the way must have been absent most, if not all, of the time. this is ss12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because by the look of the effects and scenery, the cost can't be a cent above ss1000.
