!!!!! possible spoiler !!!!!<br /><br />you`d think a story involving archie grey owl - an englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved . in fact i`d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama . worse , he`s made an extremely dire film too . pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and pony ( played by the equally wooden annie gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he`s a native american . the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of archie being an englishman - that`s why i wrote " possible spoiler " it`s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is english , but it`s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there`s absolutely no surprise involved.<br /><br />yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn`t actually a new concept . theodore roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green ( and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn`t actually been a great ecological film . in fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes grey owl , a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor
