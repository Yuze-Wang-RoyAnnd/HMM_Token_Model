i believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies. when i want a sermon, i'll go to church, but i don't want one from a movie. i don't mind some supernatural themes, (after all, religion is about as supernatural as you can get!) but this movie had so much preaching in it that i was really annoyed. the landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies. the bad guy even looked like he had horns. <br /><br />and what a silly ending: the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men, and that broke the spell. if only life were that simple. i think that when movies are that stupid, they ought to be distributed with a warning: danger! preaching contained herein!
