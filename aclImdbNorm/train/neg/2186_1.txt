...but it'll make you wonder if we had any in the first place! this movie is just as bad as any of today's horrible horror. a man goes around ogling semi-clad ladies, trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body. one scene involves a man staggering around and spurting all over the set for a full three minutes, coating everything what what must be well over ten gallons of "blood." the movie also attempts to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the movie is so badly done it's impossible for the audience to dredge up any feeling of shock or outrage. aimlessly dark and unimpressively sinister, this movie can't even get its own title straight-- the beginning credits say "the brain that wouldn't die," but the end credits list it as "the head that wouldn't die."
