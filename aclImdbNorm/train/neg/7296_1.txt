columbo movies have been going downhill for years, this year it may have reached the bottom. peter falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie. as is usual in this series, crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking. brenda vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and andrew stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady's man. (his faint, though, was a hoot!)the script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising. they should never have brought columbo into the nineties, just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots, better scripts and sharp characterisations.
