patricia hunter: oh, professor, do you also make a habit of collecting coffins? dr. lorenz: why, yes, in a manner of speaking. i find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed. <br /><br />interesting bela lugosi (glen or glenda, dracula) vehicle where he plays the mad scientist. i was especially creeped out when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests when they were sleeping.<br /><br />luana walters (girls in prison) was really appealing as a sensual reporter, patricia hunter< who was to be a victim, but woman-power trumps evil scientist every time.<br /><br />2'11" angelo rossitto and creepy frank moran , who liked to stoke the women's hair added to the film.<br /><br />interesting look at a 40s horror film.
