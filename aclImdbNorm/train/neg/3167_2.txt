henry, a veterinarian (paul rudd), and his bossy fianc'e, kate (eva longoria) are looking over the last minute arrangements for their reception. it is the morning of their wedding and kate is in a frenzy, giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation. but, horror of horrors, the "angel" ice sculpture, ordered by kate, arrives without wings. in an ensuing fight with the sculptor, the heavy "ice" maiden falls on kate and sends her to the hereafter. now, one year later, henry's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward. yet, the lovely medium, ashley (lake bell) becomes interested in henry herself, much to the chagrin of her catering partner (jason biggs). more importantly, kate returns from the other side to create havoc for ashley, as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on henry. can anything be done to return kate into heaven for good? this is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen. no, its not the cast, as they try gamely to make things work. longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fianc'e and bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious. biggs, a funny thespian, too, is totally wasted. as for rudd, a very gifted performer (see anchorman, knocked up, or clueless, please) he tries hardest of all and, in truth, is the main reason to see this clunker. his charm, looks, and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable. but, nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. so, if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one. even were free tickets to fall into your lap, be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who adore love-and-laugh cinema.
