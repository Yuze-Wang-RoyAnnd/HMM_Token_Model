what the heck was this. somebody obviously read stephen king and sartre in the same semester. we get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror. there were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music, cgi, or acting.<br /><br />the problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy. even david lynch's work feels like that at times, and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long. and sadly this is only 98 minutes.<br /><br />the cast was attractive, and that is about the limit to this. i suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have, but just doesn't make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fates...whatever they were. the final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous.
