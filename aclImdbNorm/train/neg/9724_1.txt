poor tobe hopper. he directed an all time horror classic "texas chaimsaw massacre". since then everything he's done has been horrible. this is probably the worst...and that's saying a lot. it's about a man (brad dourif) who has the ability to make things (and people) catch fire...or something like that. hardly an original idea (anyone remember "firestarter"?) it's a real mess...literally everything is done wrong! pathetic acting (even dourif!), asinine script, loust production values, crappy special effects...everything is bad!!!!! a must miss...not even good for laughs.
