takashi shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film ju-on the grudge. while i haven't seen that film, i would have to wager that there's more imagination and originality (or some rip-off originality, in other words skill with known tropes of the japanese ghost movie) than in his own directed remake. maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal, or i would guess accessibility, for an american audience. what starts off with some potential - the hint of something very screwed up going on with bill pullman's sudden movement - just goes into a total jumble. and as a horror movie? gimme a break.<br /><br />tension could have been built on the situation - a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted - but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel. scares? how's about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something. a black cat? yeah, why not just make the ghost-boy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which, in effect, is only creepy if you want cats. plot? why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told (meaning, while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall, they aren't), or for that matter have us care about anyone in the cast.<br /><br />by the time the characters, or those that are there for exposition, get around to telling us what is going on or whatever, there's little point to care. the film-making is shoddy (i.e. the 180 degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way), and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked (gellar especially is disappointing, but pullman, who shows up later after his first scene, is sorely miscast). even when shimizu tries for some average old "boo" scares, like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the grudge ghost, it's still silly. just watch when she's going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots. either you'll go with it, and if so more power to you, or you'll laugh hysterically at the results. count me in the latter.<br /><br />i'm not totally sure where this project went wrong - was it shimizu having to retool it for the studios, or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision? or maybe raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing and/or dull than they would be with someone else. the grudge gives us a lot of information that doesn't make sense or at the least give us some horror-fodder to chew on. it's cineplex trash of a sad order.
