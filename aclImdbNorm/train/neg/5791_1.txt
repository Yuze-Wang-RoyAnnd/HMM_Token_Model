as a native film professor, i can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with native content that i have ever viewed. i would rather get a root canal than view this film again. the use of stereotyping, uncreative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work were only made worse by the glib uncreative story-line and bad script. the writer and director have displayed the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying native people and communities. if this person is native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor that they have developed. if this person is non-native, they need to seriously re-examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined, unintentional racism, or if they are intentionally being ignorant. my only hope is that the native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts. if you want to see good native films then check out: christmas in the clouds, dance me outside, medicine river, powwow highway, smoke signals...to name just a few.
