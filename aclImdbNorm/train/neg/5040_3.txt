i read comments about this being the best chinese movie ever. perhaps if the only chinese movies you've seen contained no dialogue, long drawn-out far-away stares and silences, and hack editing, then you're spot on.<br /><br />complicated story-line? hardly. try juvenile and amateurish. exquisite moods and haunting memories? hardly. try flat-out boring and trite.<br /><br />this was awful. i could not wait for it to be over. particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of "how are you? i'm fine. are you sure? yes." wow! what depth of character. i guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them.<br /><br />as a huge fan of many chinese, japanese and korean films, i was totally disappointed in this. even zhang's sentimentally sappy "the road home" was better than this.
