children love dinosaurs. it's somewhat part of their culture. but they've got the land before time. the original. at least that movie had heart. this. this movie is just plain pathetic. just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children. this movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and it's more by the numbers stuff. not as soul sucking as theodore rex, but it's lightyears away from being a land before time.
