i read this thornton wilder play last year in eighth grade. i was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen. let me tell you, it's not a terrific play, it is easily surpassed, but man it deserves a much better shot. the acting was really lacking, the scenery-honest to god-looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. as if it couldn't get worse, the sound quality is lousy...there is this mind-numbing 'buzz' whenever an actor speaks...and i also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between george and emily, well, is non-existant. the actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. there is no music. it is in black and white, which would be ok but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more. in any case i think that if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie, which i don't really reccomend, then don't aim your hopes to high. the play, as stalwart as it is, is probably better.
