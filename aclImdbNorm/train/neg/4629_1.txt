obviously made to show famous 1950s stripper misty ayers "acting" talents. too bad she can't act.<br /><br />boring little tale about sweet, innocent sally down (ayers) being drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). then she meets likable tommy cole who instantly falls in love with her. he wants to help her escape but can he? you really won't care.<br /><br />there's no real skin here--ayers just strips down slowly to her underwear (twice). the rest is just a boring little tale chockful of bad acting, atrocious "comedy" (never thought prostitution was funny but what do i know?) and terrible post-dubbed dialogue. i admit there was a twist at the end i didn't see coming but that's not enough to sit through this. also ayers' attempts at acting are hysterical! a real bomb. avoid.
