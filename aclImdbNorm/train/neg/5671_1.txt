if you like to see animals being skinned alive, their heads smashed, dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them, then this one is for you! but if you are somewhat normal, and don't need to see real footage of animal cruelty, pass this one up. this movie tries to shock the viewer, and it sure does.with the animal snuff at the beginning, and the killing of babies in the movie (fake at least)its was enough to make myself turn it off.i've seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage (btk movie) and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie.we watch gore and horror because we know its just make-up, and special effects, so we shouldn't sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, its not what we rented the movie for.if anything, there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won;t be surprised by it. as a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned my stomach. the entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked.
