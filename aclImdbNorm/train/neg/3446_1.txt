this film on paper looked like it could possibly be good, after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible!! the plot has no meaning, and i think i counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous. i watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the scariness of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, they play opera i mean be serious!! this film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film. to be honest ill say no more but watch at your own risk this film is just complete rubbish, enjoy!!
