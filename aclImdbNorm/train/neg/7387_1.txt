the dvd was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and segals voice not even his!!!! pathetic! when the audio sync was better in about 5 minutes the poor plot, lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should be.<br /><br />while segal had some good movies in the early days the latest ones are a joke and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company that made it.<br /><br />if segal was the one that handled this he better return to having another party run the show, because he has no talent what so ever in this.<br /><br />this film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who viewed it. i turned it off in about 20 minutes.<br /><br />i will be asking for my money back at block buster! mark from ontario, canada
