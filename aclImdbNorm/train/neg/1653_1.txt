it just seems bizarre that someone read this script, and thought, "this is funny! i mean, it's so hilarious it just has to be made!" who was this person? is he or she the person really responsible for this? are they the one's who owe me for my time, more so than the director/writer?<br /><br />this film stinks in most every way possible. there's no one shred of good dialogue, and not one likable character. and the story...<br /><br />i prefer the 2nd worst movie ever, hulk hogan's "no hold's barred" to this by quite a considerable degree. it seems almost shakespearen in comparison.<br /><br />the ending is padded out with several minutes of outtakes, and it's still under 80 minutes. the outtakes include cast members laughing at the 'hilarious' mistakes they've made, and things that went wrong on the set of this 'comedy.' glad to see someone laughing in someway, with some connection to this 'film.'<br /><br />nothing in this film is funny. nothing. it just goes on, and on. it's truly that lame. i love films that are so bad they're good. this is so bad it's...something, but i don't know what, and hopefully will never find out.<br /><br />amanda peet doesn't suck outright, and is in fact the only half good thing about this wannabe film. but, that really means little.<br /><br />avoid at all costs.
