as many agree, origin is a beautiful anime artistically. the music, graphics, and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works. however, if you are looking for more than this, than i suggest looking else where. the beauty stops short of its appearance, and when it really comes down to plot and characters, there's nothing special. action is slow and minimal and the people are flat, corny at times, and do not act realistically. not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there... so, in summary, oh my goodness, i've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my goodness, it's like... -poke- people don't act like that. it took a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization, and unfortunately, there's not even that much action to make up for that...
