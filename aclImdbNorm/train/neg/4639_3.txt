eyes of the werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. the premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible. i wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production. some blind dude gets some new eyes, bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf. nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature. can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? who is that weird little troll who helps him out and what's up with that female cop? if you really want to find out, check out eyes of the werewolf!<br /><br />not a bad idea for a movie. i just wished the filmmakers would have spent a lot for time in pre-production before they decided to shoot the movie.
