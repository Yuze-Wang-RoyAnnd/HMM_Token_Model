this is a rather tame fluff piece concerning ww ii codes being broken, stolen, etc. the acting is about what i expected from this cast of mgm "b" actors.<br /><br />one big caution. jean rogers, who did such a great job playing the very sexy dale arden in the first two flash gordon serials is just awful in this movie. her character is extremely annoying. she absolutely never lets-up with her overacting. we are supposed to believe that during the height of a world war in what would obviously be a top secret code facility, she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office of her choosing although she has no official function. from that standpoint i'm sorry that i ever watched this film. it has forever changed my perception of ms. rogers. talentwise, she is an extreme lightweight.<br /><br />lee bowman is his usual self, meaning that he is merely adequate.<br /><br />
