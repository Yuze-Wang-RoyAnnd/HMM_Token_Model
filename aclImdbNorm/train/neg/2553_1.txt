bad. bad. bad. bad. bad. what else can i say. kate jackson must have been desperate to direct. may be she should go back to acting...on second thought she was a bad actress to. who would put money in to producing something this bad. i like anti-christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just bad bad bad. the acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera. the special effects, if you can call them that, where laughable. i would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of. we had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes. this so called movies original prints should be destroyed, all disc' and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie. then those people should never be allowed to act, direct or film any thing but their own home movies.
