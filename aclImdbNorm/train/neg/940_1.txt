okay guys, we know why we watch film like "the invisible maniac" (just look at the cover, man!). t and a all over the place (with a lot more t than a). but...shouldn't there be a story to go with it?<br /><br />"c'mon," i can hear you say - "this is just girls gettin' naked! who needs a story??!"<br /><br />well, if this were called "the naked maniacs", i wouldn't have a problem. but since these guys are cribbing from "the invisible man", they need to have a bit of story hereabouts, you know, to keep your mind busy.<br /><br />however, all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and, when he cracks, uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers. and when you see the smarmy-looking teenagers he goes after, you'll be grateful.<br /><br />one star, for the t and a, but there's a little too much gore for you skin fans, so proceed with caution.<br /><br />tidbit - yes, it's that savannah.
