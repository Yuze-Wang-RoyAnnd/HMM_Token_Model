mr perlman gives a standout performance (as usual). sadly, he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces.<br /><br />larsen is in "die hard" mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles, i'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part.<br /><br />the lovely erika is very decorative (even though fully clothed!) and shows some signs of "getting" acting at last.<br /><br />sfx are mainly poor cgi and steals from other movies.<br /><br />the shootouts are pitiful - worthy of the a-team<br /><br />not even worth seeing for perlman - avoid
