i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse (supposibly children's) film i have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />i took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins. the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film. they should pay you to watch it not you pay them. it's truly truly awful, there is no other way to describe it. the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences.<br /><br />aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren regards, stephen
