this was a disappointment - none of the nuance of the original. the brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over-the-top histrionics of the american version. the original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings. i have watched the series many times and am still enthralled.<br /><br />just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of "cracker". get hooked up with bbc america or bbc canada and watch for such delights as waking the dead, spooks, silent witness, and judge john deed. watch the original touching evil, then look for "wire in the blood" for more of the truly understated, elegant performance of robson green. hollywood needs to have a look at this actor!
