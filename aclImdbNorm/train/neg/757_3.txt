my children watch the show everyday that its on. its a great program for younger children. however they need to stop showing re-runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of rooney's and deedee's yellow teeth. moe is the only doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 don't ever brush their teeth? does the show ever make its way to the united states and if so where can we find its schedule at. and one other thing if we might be able to add. moe you need to stop hiding so much. sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope? what does that signify? other then getting wet all the time. they need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole. kids loose interest that way.
