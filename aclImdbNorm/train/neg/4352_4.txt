if you have seen friends, the writing will feel very familiar. especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same comedy setups.<br /><br />the show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young (about 10 years old i think). now, they're in their mid-twenties, and they meet again on a class reunion. this is where the series starts.<br /><br />a typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once. they're usually not connected in any way. each story line is cut up into multiple sections, which are then shown in a mixed order.<br /><br />the sketches is where my problems lie with this series. as in the later seasons of friends, it's often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations. one of the main characters does something really stupid that's hard to believe. the situation is then heavily exaggerated, as if it wasn't silly enough. if you're into this kind of in-your-face humor, then maybe you'll like this series. for me it is a great turn-off.<br /><br />the reason i started watching friends is because of the first few seasons. there are interesting and especially credible story lines, with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters. the class has none of this. the characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far. it's therefore not possible to relate to them and like them.<br /><br />at least with friends, it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out. but in the class, it seems it has run out of steam before it even started.
