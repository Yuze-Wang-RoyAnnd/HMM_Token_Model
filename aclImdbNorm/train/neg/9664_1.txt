this book-based movie is truly awful, and a big disappointment. we've been waiting for this move over a month. many film reviewer were hopeful for it. also in newspapers and tv, it made big sense. when 29th april comes, many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful. why? first of all story was so monotone. it has been many indefinite scenes, sometimes it's hard to realize what's going on. the actresses, out of hulya avsar, weren't harmonized with their roles, especially vildan atasever. she acts better in comedy films, in this movie, a kind of drama, she couldn't disposed of her previous role. and finally movie is too short, just 66 minutes.
