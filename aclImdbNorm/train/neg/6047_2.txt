what made the french connection work so well was the relationship between doyle (hackman) and russo (scheider). in this catastrophe directed by frankenheimer (who also brought us such gems as raindeer games and the island of dr. moreau) the movie focuses on doyle and his singular obsession of capturing charnier (rey). the fictitious idea that the nypd would allow doyle to travel to marseilles to find charnier with the help of the french local authorities is laugh out loud funny. correct me if i'm wrong, but didn't charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack!!! a street value of 32 million but yeah, let's send doyle to find this guy, it was his pinch after all. please!!! the story was weak. the acting was terrible (with the lone exception of hackman, who completely overplayed his part). the direction was all over the place. even the cuts between scenes were terrible. do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one.
