i actually paid to see this movie in the theater.<br /><br />it would get a 1-rating, but the fight scenes between the robots are okay, and there's a surprise.<br /><br />i realize that some movies have larger budgets than others. i don't have a problem with that. unfortunately, science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons. but, one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap. i mean, couldn't they even make it "look" good?<br /><br />the other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting if i watched the movie now and knew what to expect, i might just enjoy it for the cheese-factor, but at the time, i was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being.<br /><br />thankfully, the experience was over in only 85 minutes.
