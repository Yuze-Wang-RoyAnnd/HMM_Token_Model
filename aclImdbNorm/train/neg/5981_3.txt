i just saw this movie (mainly because brady corbet is in it), and i must say that i was not pleased. <br /><br />of course, the computer graphics were amazing, but the story line needed a little touch-up. also, i think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood, as well if it were rated pg-13. <br /><br />that would definitely attract more people to see it-->teens. what would also attract more teens (particularly teen girls), would be a large close up of brady corbet on the thunderbirds poster! <br /><br />even though the movie had it's down points, i still saw it and thought it was okay!
