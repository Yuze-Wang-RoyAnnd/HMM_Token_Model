the story is a little slow and a little stupid. greta garbo doesn't look very good and i couldn't understand half the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. melvyn douglas, meanwhile, plays his normal unlikeable role and constance bennett is just so-so except for a couple of her screams, which were funny. <br /><br />on the plus side, roland young had the best role in the film. i wish he had more lines, as he disappeared in the second half of the story. also, it was interesting to see ruth gordon look so young. i had only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late '60s to the '80s and a whacked out old woman. story-wise, the best part might have been the final few minutes when we see a stunt man doing amazing things on skis, pretending to be douglas falling down the slopes. that was amazing and humorous footage.<br /><br />overall, i can see where this film - garbo's last - was not a box-office success. it just drags too much, going on and on about deceptions. it's an annoying story. garbo knew it, too, and called it quits.
