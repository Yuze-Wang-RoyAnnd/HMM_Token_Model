the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. ooooof! her loins rival those of nina hartley. this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. i'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the '80s. kurt russell must have had a fun life.
