filmed in a documentary style, but you can pretty well tell participants had been coached. a recently divorced wannabe film maker(myles berkowitz)sees a chance to liven up his love life and step into the movie biz at the same time. he intends to make a documentary piece about finding love by filming twenty dates including ramifications. the comedy is spotty at best; the rest is mishap after mishap. also taking part are richard arlook, robert mckee and the enticing elisabeth wagner. trying for credibility the fetching tia carrere is talked into a cameo. this will suffice as a handbook on how not to get a satisfactory date.
