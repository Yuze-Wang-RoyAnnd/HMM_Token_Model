this film has got several key flaws. the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life. this means that the film cannot captivate it's audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it! in short, it really is very very very very very very very bad! do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman.
