yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can.<br /><br />boring direction and performances (with the exception of the lovely annabel schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material, and the ever earnest charlton heston) earn the rating of a real stinker.<br /><br />it's amazing to watch heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is. he even plays in a sub-plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie. the way they ended up resolving it was that they didn't. it simply falls off the end.<br /><br />really. don't waste your time on this one.
