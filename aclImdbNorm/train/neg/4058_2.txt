from the start, you know how this movie will end. it's so full of clich'es your typical nra member will not even like this movie. i give it 2 out of 10, only because of the acting of william benton. i can't believe people voted 6+ for this movie. it's so biased towards a 'certain point of view' (once a thief...). people aren't born bad. neither are they born good. they are born with a clean slate. it's society, parents and education what makes them who they are. and if they take the wrong turn, somewhere down the line, it certainly isn't going to be the american penal system that gets them back on track! anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. i bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap.<br /><br />
