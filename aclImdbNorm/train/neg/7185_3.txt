i was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror.<br /><br />to my disappointment, this turned into more of a comedy than a horror. the acting, dialog, and flow of the movie was all very poorly done. much of it didn't make sense. for example, there's a party of about 30 people and they're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard. i kept thinking, maybe this was a parody of another movie like scary movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome - emphasis on try.<br /><br />the blood and gore are also poorly done. i've seen halloween costumes look more believable than this. a guy with his head cut clean off... looked clean - missing signs bone, flesh, blood, and even the head. a strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something... seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax.<br /><br />revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist, but contradicted other parts in the story. what was going in the guy's mind to turn out like that? if there was going to be a twist, you should at least build up to it adding mystery and suspense.
