i watched the movie, and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience. the language would put to shame the street loafers.<br /><br />the plot; a father forcing none of his son to marry, seems far-fetched. <br /><br />the idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded's attention.<br /><br />...and i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh, and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look.<br /><br />hope it saves your time!
