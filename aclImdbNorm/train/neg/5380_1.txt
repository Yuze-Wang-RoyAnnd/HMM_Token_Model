at the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50% of imdb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1. i can only surmise then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members. <br /><br />they say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters, those monkeys, just by random proddings at the keyboard, would eventually type out the complete works of shakespeare. however, i seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time, you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10.<br /><br />i patiently watched the first half, foolishly assuming that the film would, on some level, develop either the plot or the characters, or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke barely intellectual thought. failing that, i was quite prepared to accept action, suspense, comedy, horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention. ultimately, i was disappointed and consequently, much of the second half was viewed at double speed as i searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption. sadly, there was none.<br /><br />if "the choke", was put up against an episode of scooby doo then i'm afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. and speaking of cartoon characters, the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable (at best) and embarrassingly poor with brooke bailey's portrayal of the freaky, death obsessed pseudo goth, london, being so bad i almost felt sorry for her.<br /><br />i would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack, a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock, failed even to entertain, let alone serve to enhance a very poor flick.
