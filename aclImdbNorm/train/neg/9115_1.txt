if you ask me the first one was really better one. look at sarah m. g., she is real, mean, cruel girl, look at amy adams she is just little fool hanging around. she is nothing! people don't adore her! second, sebastian was cute and hot in first movie, now he is "baby face". story is not that good, and i do not understand. why didn't they make this one first, it is the beginning. loosy actors, nothing with story. this is not cruel, this is playing. first one has better actors, better story, and its mean. i think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3. it is not the worst movie i saw, but in compaer with first one its one big, big, big nothing.
