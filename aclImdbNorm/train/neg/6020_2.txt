i like end-of-days movies. i like b-movies. i was hoping i would like this movie.<br /><br />i could ignore the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the cringe-inducing lines. i could ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter. i could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys. none of these things kill the movie. what kills this movie is that it's just plain and simple boring. nothing actually happens; almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense.<br /><br />if you're looking for an entertaining b-movie, look elsewhere. this movie is just boring.
