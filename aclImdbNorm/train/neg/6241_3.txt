something that really does not go down right with al gore (and his supporters)'s theory is the whole thing about "concensus".<br /><br />if there were such a consensus, why is it that the "believers" in the almighty global warming feel the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who questions them.<br /><br />why is it that anyone who does not toe the line on global warming is met with smug accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of the oil companies (apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean you're on anyone's payroll in that wondrous world...) why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled, when it is the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions? for some ideas on the answer to those questions, read prey by the well-know oil-stooge michael crichton... oh wait, he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies. he just took a huge career risk in not toeing the line of the greens and other kyoto worshippers and told the truth as he researched it. by the way did you know that abiding to the kyoto protocol would result in almost no lowering of temperatures, according to its own backers? just a few questions that al gore made sure to stay away from lest he not get every penny of the environmental lobby in case he decides to run again.<br /><br />so who's a stooge..?
