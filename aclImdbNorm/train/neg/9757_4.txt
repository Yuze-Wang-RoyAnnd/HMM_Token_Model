not the greatest film to remember paul naschy by.<br /><br />gaston (guillermo bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman i have ever seen. zorro would be ashamed! his only salvation came as the competition was just as bad.<br /><br />this film is described as adventure and horror. forget the horror - there is none. no nudity, no blood, no monsters; just a robin hood adventure against an evil baron (paul naschy) who wants to be king.<br /><br />the main feature of the film was seeing graciela nilson, who only made four films in two years and disappeared to our regrettable loss. where did she go?
