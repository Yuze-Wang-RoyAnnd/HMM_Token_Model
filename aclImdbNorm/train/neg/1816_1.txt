this movie is truly brilliant. it ducks through banality to crap at such speed you don't even see good sense and common decency to mankind go whizzing past. but it doesn't stop there! this movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of ludicrous comedy: behold as kor the beergutted conan wannabe with the over-abundance of neck hair struts his stuff swinging his sword like there's no tomorrow (and the way he swung it, i really am amazed there *was* a tomorrow for him, or at least, for his beer gut). don't miss this movie, it's a fantastic romp through idiocy, and sheer bloody mindedness! and once you have finished watching this one, dry the tears of joy (or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling) from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another $5 to make a sequel!
