i generally don't give worry much about violence in films, or a vast amount of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us. there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature, a good setting of characters, a good direction. this film could be voted for as a good film. however, it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting.<br /><br />first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film. not movie violence, i am talking about real violence. this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two; the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women. not that we all don't have some real twists with women.(respectively men). but the conclusion of the film ruins it all. <br /><br />*spoiler* our "heroine" finally dies, (by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it enraged me, now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch)and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon, nature growing over her, in particular her sex.. of course it is the director who "kills" the women heroine. women have to die, especially if men are attracted by their sexuality. that seems to be the final conclusion.**end spoiler*<br /><br />well, well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself. but to use big pictures, artsy directions cruelty to living creatures, just to say men can be frightened of women, and men are cruel to women. thats just not enough. i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and whatever approach. but to me this film is just totally marred.
