this is a review of 'freddy mercury the untold story,' theatrical release, chicago int. film festival, 2007 one of the phoniest, uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries i have seen. if the film i saw in a movie theater was originally released on tv, i would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature. even as a made-for-tv documentary, the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous, pseudo-literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed infomercial. the only redeeming aspects of this "the untold story of freddy mercury" -- or, uhm, was it "the untold story of princess diana" are the original concert, video and tv footage -- unabridged freddy mercury and queen. testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights, such as: "he was a free spirit," (really.. i thought freddy mercury was a company man...) belittle those freddy testimonials, by brian may or montserrat caballe that shed new and affectionate light into mercury's complex life and character. and... what up with the harry potter-like boarding school segments? how did the interview with the first girl-crush ("...who now works in a travel agency") and members of freddy's first school band contribute to what i really want to know about mercury? vital milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, queen, the band remain unexplored. these filmmakers don't ask a single, provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject, instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend, who doesn't deserve to be remembered by this history channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a sunday night.
