inspector gadget (1999) **<br /><br />starring: matthew broderick, rupert everett, joely fisher, andy dick, dabney coleman director: david kellogg 80 minutes rated pg<br /><br />by blake french:<br /><br />disney's new film, "inspector gadget" is about a cop named john who survives a major accident and is saved by a state of the art experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine-like agent who has tools and contraptions of all sorts built into his body at his use when he says "go go," only to be called inspector gadget!<br /><br />the actual movie's structure is much like the body formation of inspector gadget himself. it is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consist of a bunch of half hearted contraptions thrown together to make something that doesn't have much in common with anything else present. the film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are kind of pasted together with characters and an uneven story that only kids between the ages of 6-9 would enjoy.<br /><br />the cop who is dramatically reinvented is played by matthew broderick, who, until "inspector gadget," was on a success spree with movies like "election." his character becomes inspector gadget after an encounter with the film's heavy handed villain named claw. he is played by rupert everett, who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful "william shakespeare's a midsummer nights dream."<br /><br />there is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as ample amounts of scenes involving inspector gadget's wacky body parts and mechanism elements. it has gadget and claw drooling over the attractive character brenda, played by joely fisher, for both her looks and her knowledge of a specific invention made by her late father, who was earlier killed by claw. competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film. also a major character is the gadget mobil, a life like automobile that is devised for inspector gadget himself. it is voiced by d.l. hughly from the sitcom comedy "the hughly's."<br /><br />"inspector gadget" is a movie that i found quite bad. i know, i am not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers, but even my ten year old relative found the film to his disliking. the movie is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. i never found myself caring about the characters. there is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits, unlike the much worse 1997 film, "mr. magoo," which opened using clips of the original cartoon. is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedy-which is seldom funny and hardly ever convincing. the overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gags and consists of one joke: inspector gadget's bumbling goofiness.<br /><br />in movies like this the audience lusts for boundaries-something to help make out what can happen and what can not. in "inspector gadget" there are no such boundaries. this is truthfully nothing more than a party time for the actors, who surly had lots of fun. i am reminded of another lacking comedy released a few years ago called "blankman" which again, contained lots of props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and props, but it too lacked something needed for every movie: audience participation.<br /><br />a character that i found being left out a lot is gadgets daughter, who by the end of the movie, i still has not clue of what her name was. she is used only as a plot device-and i question how she was used to further the plot as well. for her presence brings nothing relevant or productive to the film. we never know her reactions to her father's operation or accidents. thus, this is someone who could have been completely left out and would have not affected the movie a bit.<br /><br />in closing, i'd like to state that "inspector gadget" is an awful, insufficient excuse for a children's comedy. and believe it or not, i find myself comparing this film to last years violent and very anti-young audience action picture "blade." i am stating once again that i had much rather have a movie where nothing happens than one in which everything happens. "inspector gadget" had so much going for it at the same time, it made literally made me dizzy.<br /><br />
