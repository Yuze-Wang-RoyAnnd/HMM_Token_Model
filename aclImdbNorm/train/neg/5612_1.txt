as a spiritualist and non christian. i thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith, but what a load of i seers. i thought the film would have great arguments, but only got one sided views from atheists and jews??? and who are all these street people he's interviewing who don't know the back of their arm from their head. where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from. not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970. personally this dvd was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti-christ told me so. please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding god because his own ego and demons got the better of him. no im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves. but if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in jesus then entice us with your worth, not your beating off the drums.
