please, be warned: this movie, though a pretty bad storyline, was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen...ever. just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.<br /><br />so, it officially begins with a party. just your average party but there's some guy there. he's pretty into kate...if you know what i'm saying. memorise his face; it'll help later.<br /><br />so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney (didn't i say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. that's london underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. so the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. now kate, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground. alone. well, almost...<br /><br />so the movie just carries on from there. blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.<br /><br />in short, it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho. or as the case may have it, creep.<br /><br />i'd say give it a go if you're into saw, hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us, scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much.
