this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. this is saying quite a bit, considering some of the choices i've made in film rentals.<br /><br />i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it. the topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender.<br /><br />the "skits" are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gags, and it's such a blatant (and poor) rip-off of the kentucky fried movie that you'll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of "vince offer" (whoever that is).<br /><br />unless you are a masochist, avoid this pile of rubbish.
