the secret is...this movie blows. sorry, but it just did. <br /><br />****spoiler****<br /><br />in this bad riff on i know what you did last summer and scream, beth, played admirably by dorie barton, joins several friends on a spring break trip. the group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. then, the deaths begin. first one then another then another of the friends is murdered, leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results. <br /><br />one note, dorie barton is the poor man's reese witherspoon
