i, too, was fooled by the packaging. i, too, fell for the gory packaging and the dvd casing that claims "grieved fans as every copy was pulled from shelves". though it was inexpensive ($6.99), it wasn't really all that worth it - no scares, and very limited gore. the ending was very cheesy and didn't deliver the punch it should have. i really don't even know how it became a "video nasty" with how very tame it is. the story drags, the characters are obvious amateur actors...it doesn't live up to the promise. the dvd bonus feature (the "interview")is very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there. the lead actress talks like she's appearing in a shakespearean production. it's a great laugh.
