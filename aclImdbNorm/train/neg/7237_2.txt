life is really too short for movies like this. i knew it couldn't be good when i realized what i'd already suspected - that david schwimmer would be playing the exact same type of person he plays in 'friends'.<br /><br />let's face it, either the guy can't play anything but a nerd or he is never offered any other parts. i have a feeling that it's a mixture of both.<br /><br />and i have to say that it is extremely difficult to like a movie that utterly wastes the considerable talents of gwyneth paltrow, barbara hershey, toni collette and carol kane!!!
