i saw this film yesterday. i must admit, it weren't my cup of tea. although it's supposed to be a horror movie of its kind. but as i was watching this, i was thinking.. 'this movie isn't making any sense at all..' where on earth did this guy in the dark coat came from? where were the two guys were going when they left the girls behind? where on earth did a shark came out from?<br /><br />all these elements in this film somehow didn't add up. i felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a film that was so bound to be so crap.<br /><br />i've seen many good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the most worst horror flicks i've seen. at the end of the movie, i said to myself that i wouldn't watch it again.. so much pappy show in this film, i've decided to give it the thumbs down! count me out on this one! 0 out of 10!
