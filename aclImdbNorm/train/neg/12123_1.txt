recently, i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city (olathe, ks.) of this title. it is difficult for me, being a lover of the art as i am, to report the following, but, the truth sometimes hurts, and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe (i'm using the slang definition here - worthless statements or writing) for an hour and a half, i feel obligated to share (warn) any interested parties. let's begin at the beginning, a good place to start as always. the first 15 minutes are not really that bad, a couple of laughs, and decent development, but then it is downhill from there. this is the story of a woman, in her mid thirties, that (as the writer would like for you to believe) is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled. the first major difficulty occurs when if you don't know that fact going into the movie, you won't know it when she suddenly risks it all for, in my opinion, a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman. there is little development (drastically insufficient development) to justify her actions for the affair she has, and when it occurs, one feels, as i did, that she is just of low moral character. the word "slut" comes to mind, hopefully, they'll let that pass the review and post the comment. this, in my opinion, is the first fatal flaw of the film. if you're married or have ever been in love, irregardless of whether you are male or female, its going to turn you off. quite frankly, i feel that it would have made a much better "blue movie" - that's the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving. the second fatal flaw is the casting, diane lane just didn't work for me here, and viggo mortensen is not the right man for the job, believe me. the only saving grace to the entire film is anna paquin, the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places, conveying a subtle yet very blunt (i apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate) portrayal of an emerging teen. bravo, well done. i'm not going to give the ending away, but i was disappointed, being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing... but an ending like that.... well, if that teased you enough to see this picture, don't say i didn't warn you, but you better look fast - if this celluloid is released, i doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames. i'd say wait for the video, but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value. hmmm, dustin hoffman produced this, you think he'd learn after ishtar. this film once carried the working title "blouse man" and should have been left on the rack. if you've never in your life wanted to walk out on a film, give this one 35-40 minutes, the only thing worth staying for is anna paquin, if you can stomach the fact that you'll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home, which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you're off to the movies to see this one. that's my two cents, for what it is worth.
