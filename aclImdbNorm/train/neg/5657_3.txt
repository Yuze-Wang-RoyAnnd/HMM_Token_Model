i'm a great admirer of lon chaney, but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me. the story jumps around oddly (i've since learned that the film is missing a section), and characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness. some of the intertitles are overly explanatory (e.g., "why, you're not a child anymore!"--cut back to picture for a long, slow beat--"you're a woman!" yes, we got it the first time) but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear. (let's hear luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, please!) the plot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch. to the writer's credit, this issue was treated as a problem, and a may-december match is not portrayed as the right-and-good inevitability of some mary pickford films (e.g., "daddy-long-legs"). chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but i think he has been better-directed in the past--he overdid it a few times here, imho. i did enjoy the clown sequences, and was very impressed at the stunts. loretta young was charming, though astonishingly young. the film has its moments, but so far, it's my least-favorite chaney picture.
