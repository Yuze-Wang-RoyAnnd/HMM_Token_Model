i found horrorvision almost unwatchable. while only 70 minutes in length i still found myself hitting the fast forward button again and again. the acting was of the `if i scream and say ***k a lot i'm intense' school. and the story was at best a scenario that had yet to be fleshed out.<br /><br />while i never go to full moon for great film making i have never seen them produce as bad a piece of junk as this.
