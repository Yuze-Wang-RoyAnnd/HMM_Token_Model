this is a typical low budget 1970's mess. it's supposed to be a docudrama about a crew hunting bigfoot through the pacific northwest. every character is a stereotype, from the native american to the cynical cowboy. the acting and narration are a complete joke. if you're hoping to see a lot of bigfoot footage - keep hoping. there won't be much, and what there is you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder; it would look better than this movie.<br /><br />it's not that i don't like 1970's low budge fare; i do. it's that this is such a mess of bad acting, bad characters, lousy story and no thrills that you just can't enjoy it. it does not fit into the "so bad it's good" category, nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of illicit substances. it's mostly a lot of boring footage of the people camping, hiking, riding horses, and watching wild life. there is a bigfoot attack which is completely stupid; supposedly our friend sasquatch is throwing rocks down on the campers from above while they fire their rifles back at him. by that point you are rooting heavily for bigfoot to drops some rocks on the filmmaker's heads and stop the whole thing.
