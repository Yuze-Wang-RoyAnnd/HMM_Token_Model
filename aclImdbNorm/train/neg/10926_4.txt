while the idea is more original than most sci-fi movies, the execution is, as usual lacking. while the practical mummy effects are not bad, and the "gun nut" character is over the top giggle inducing, the only real draw is to see morena baccarin and adam baldwin reunited on the small screen. i suspect that was the idea all along. they do the best they can with what they have but the "must see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when morena's character sported some tomb raider style shorts. not high brow cinema i know but you can't deny true beauty when you see it!!! and adam baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate. if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you. if you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere.
