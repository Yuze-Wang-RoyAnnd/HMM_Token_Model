you know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious, thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably? when you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? "house of the dead" struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema.<br /><br />from start to end "house of the dead" manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. it is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which they exploit shamelessly) whereas the males for their hardcore "kick-ass" attitude. i honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. uwe boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. at least then we'll get better acting
