while william shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in, (and i especially love him as denny crane in boston legal), well, this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down.<br /><br />it has none of the intelligence of millionaire, none of the flair of deal or no deal.<br /><br />this show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the time.<br /><br />i watched it of course just to check it out. i did watch it for over 45 minutes, then i had to turn it off.<br /><br />the best part of it was william shatner dancing on the stage. he is a hoot!!! unfortunately, this show will not make it.<br /><br />that's a given
