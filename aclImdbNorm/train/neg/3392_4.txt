what's with indonesian musical movies? never have i seen indonesian musical movies like the ones made in bollywood. they miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of 'what they called' poetic lines.<br /><br />this story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks. it's a simple story plot (but it's quite focused though) with 'meant to be' musical story lines here and there.<br /><br />confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected. the main actress may try to live up the character, but it's the best that she could do, trying. as for the casting, i don't feel the necessity to put a balinese student in that story and of course, that's not the only unnecessary characters.<br /><br />the strange thing is, why would i want to watch this movie? maybe because of the mangoes...
