spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta. the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii, or goodfellas. it is not in the same league.<br /><br />but what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent. pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him. i was looking forward to see abrahams and loggia, but their steenky accents spoiled the fun.<br /><br />ah well, the script ain't too hot either. don corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the back all the while.
