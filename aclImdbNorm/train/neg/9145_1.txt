let me first state that i enjoy watching "bad" movies. it's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones. this film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. this vehicle for sam mraovich's delusional ego doesn't just border on talentless ineptitude, it has redefined the very meaning of the words. this should forever be the barometer for bad movies. sort of the mendoza line for film. mr. mraovich writes, directs, and stars as blunt object arthur sailes battling scorned wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben "dead behind the eyes" sheets struggle for marital equality. as a libertarian i believe gays should have a right to get married. ben & arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes. the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and ham-fisted, trademark mraovich, that you can't possibly take any of them seriously. arthur's brother victor, the bible toting jesus freak, is so horribly over-the-top evil/effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role. that's because sam "multitasking" mraovich was also casting director. the worst of it all is sam mraovich himself. when you think leading man do the words pasty, balding, and chubby come to mind? sam also delivers lines like domino's pizza, cold and usually wrong. the final tally: you suck at writing, directing, acting and casting. that's the ed wood quadruple crown. congratulations you horrible little man.
