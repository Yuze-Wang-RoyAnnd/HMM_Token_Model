as with many other pop-culture franchise series, this line just didn't know when to quit. instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended, they went on to generate this; the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark.<br /><br />this movie should never have happened. it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line, and it sure shows. the premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same.<br /><br />after the wonderful experience which was the omen, this was a major disappointment which stank of 70's cheese and horrible acting. it was reminiscent of the amityville horror in those aspects, and left a terrible, lingering stench long after it was over. <br /><br />it rates a 1.4/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
