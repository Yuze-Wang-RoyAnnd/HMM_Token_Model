les visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny. i like jean reno as an actor, but there was more. there were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of louis de funes.<br /><br />now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors in great part and the same time traveling. the plot changes a little, since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers. so they jump up and down in history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. the duke, jean reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing, but his character has been emptied, so there's not a lot he can do to save the film.<br /><br />now the duke's slave/helper, he has really all the attention. the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience, but he does not succeed. it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling that joke till the end, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer.<br /><br />if you liked les visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. if you didn't like les visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel. if you liked this sequel... well, i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies.
