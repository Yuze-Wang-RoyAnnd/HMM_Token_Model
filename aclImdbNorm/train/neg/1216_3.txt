the genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one. the big problem is implausability. i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next, but this movie was so predictable, and is just not believable. i find that the more i watch this kind of movie, the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger. continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid. if they took the time to make it more realistic, i might have enjoyed it a little. having said that, you might be better off staying away from this one.
