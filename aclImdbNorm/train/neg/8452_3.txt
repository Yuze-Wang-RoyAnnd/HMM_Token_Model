this is the first time i have commented on a film because i felt that if the right person read it, they might wake up and do something about it. over the last few months, abc family began airing a new format of movies. i have seen the last three and enjoyed them. they were engaging and did the trick. my wife likes these films. i was looking forward to viewing "see jane date". the trailers looked and sounded great. unfortunately, this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project. the year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store. it was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all. it worked against it. i work in the business of film and television . i enjoy being entertained. this is one instance where i kept thinking could it get any worse. the script had lines from another decade and i know these women can act but you wouldn't know it from this movie. to add to the overall experience, the end left me shaking my head. an advice to the executives at disney, abc , abc family and the producers: under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films. they have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word "contemporary" , "present day" and "current" means when describing a romantic comedy. there is a world passing you by. all in all a huge disappointment from folks at von zerneck-sertner and abc family.
