this film aka "the four hundred blows" is a mistranslation.faire les 400 coups" means"to live a wild life. as a french,i'm stunned when i see the popularity of this good ,but by no means outstanding film. 1.it's not the first film of the "nouvelle vague" move;check agnes varda's "la pointe courte",(1956)alain resnais's "hiroshima mon amour"(1958),claude chabrol's "le beau serge"(1958) are anterior .historically,"les 400 coups " comes after. 2.the "nouvelle vague" was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors:overnight,julien duvivier,henri-george clouzot,claude autant-lara ,yves all'egret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion.this selfishness and this contempt is typically "nouvelle vague".you 've never heard (or read) the great generation of the thirties (renoir,carn'e,gr'emillon,duvivier already,feyder) laugh at ,say,maurice tourneur or max linder.so,thanks to truffaut and co,some people will never discover some gems of the french fifties or forties(duvuvier's "sous le ciel de paris",autant-lara's "douce",yves all'egret's "une si jolie petite plage " and "man`eges").the novelle vague clique went as far as saying that william wyler,georges stevens and fred zinemann were worthless! 3."les 400 coups " is technically rather disappointing:it's very academic ,the story is as linear as it can be,the teachers are caricatures,and the mother claire maurier delivers such memorable lines as (you've got to be a french circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is): well ,your father 's got only his brevet (junior school diploma)and,as for me ,i've got only my high school diploma!you've got to know,that circa 1960,hardly 10%of the pupils had the hsd in france! antoine doinel should have been proud of his mother after all!she wants him to have diplomas,who can blame her? 4.compared to the innovations of "hiroshima mon amour",which features a brand new form,and a new "fragmented " content,"les 400 coups " pales into significance.truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior "jules and jim", helped by the incomparable jeanne moreau. 5.the interpretation is rather stiff;jean-pierre l'eaud ,arguably listenable when dubbed in english ,is still decent,but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation. 6.the topic=stolen childhood had better days,before (julien duvivier's "poil de carotte" ,luis bunuel's "los olvidados") and will have after (maurice pialat's "l'enfance nue",kenneth loach's "kes") i do not want to demean truffaut,his movie is not bad,but,frankly,french movie buffs,prefer "jules and jim" "l'enfant sauvage" (a film honest ,true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault)"l'argent de poche"(as academic as "400 coups" but much more funny)or his nice hitchcock pastiche "vivement dimanche".<br /><br />
