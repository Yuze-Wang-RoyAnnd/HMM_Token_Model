how good is gwyneth paltrow! this is the right movie for her... too bad she's completely out role. i haven't read the book by jane austen, but i can't believe it is so superficial and the characters aren't much more than caricatures. it wasn't probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book, but i had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups. i was taking a sigh of relief every time i saw an actor who didn't overstep the mark of overacting (a couple of times).
