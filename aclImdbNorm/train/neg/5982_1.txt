i am very sorry to say this but "thunderbirds" does not even come up with a loud pop, never mind any thunder. at one stage i gave serious consideration to walking out of the cinema, i stayed in the forlorn hope that the film might improve. i was to be disappointed, it did not get any better, it got worse if that is at all possible. had i gone to see the film with the thought that it was going to be a "spoof" i would still have been let down. they had an excellent opportunity to make a great franchise of films here, they have totally wasted that opportunity. bill paxton and sir ben kingsley should be embarrassed to have there names attached to this film and jonathan frakes well what can i say, he should be embarrassed and ashamed would not be to far from the truth. i saw this film at a pre-release showing, i had been waiting to see it most eagerly, having grown up in the sixties with the original shows. to say i was disappointed would be something of an understatement. one final thing i will say about the film was the puppets in the tv shows were just a bit more wooden than where the actors in the film.
