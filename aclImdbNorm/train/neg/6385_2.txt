gayniggers from outer space is pretty much summed up by its name. running only 27 minutes long, it describes a spaceship of gay blacks that come to earth to free the men from women. while i see a little significance to the plot, it also is really illogical. granted, its meant to be a comedy/spoof on society and science fiction. i found myself laughing several times, so it succeeds there.<br /><br />the special effects are horrible. when the spaceship is floating above the earth, you can see stars zoom by for no apparent reason. the asteroids shown in the beginning look fake, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several misspellings in the text, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are messed up; in general, the whole thing doesn't take itself seriously. if you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie, its very accessible and easy to see through to the end. some parts are hilarious. but overall, the only thing that you are left remembering is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever.<br /><br />seeing that its a short film and has some funny aspects, its not the worst thing to see. but its illogical and holds little long-term value. i can't really recommend it; if you do watch it, do so for the unique concept, not the quality.
