director fred schepisi(roxanne) directs this well intentioned, but inferior comedy about albert einstein(matthau) trying to hook his scientific niece(ryan) up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950's. to get ryan to like robbins, einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scientist. the idea is cute, but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue. tim robbins, meg ryan, and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are unable to rescue the film. its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie. i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan.
