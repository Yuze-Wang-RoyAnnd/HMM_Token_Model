disney's done it again. the company that made "mr. magoo" and "george of the jungle" has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based, and keeps none of the spirit of the original.<br /><br />"inspector gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when i was a young one, and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then. now that that movie does exist, i was severely disappointed, even outraged.<br /><br />first we have the characters.<br /><br />gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon (with well-done special effects accompanying them), and he even has some of the naivete of the original gadget, but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while penny and brain just watch.<br /><br />penny has little to do; while she played a major role in the cartoon, discovering the crime and halting it, and occasionally getting captured by the mad agents, now she is simply introduced and then forgotten, although she does at least sneak into claw's base.<br /><br />claw is the movie's version of dr. claw, who was a rather sinister, raspy-voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair, his face hidden from view, as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes. now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand, with no mystery behind the character.<br /><br />brain and mad cat exist in the movie, but are rather insignificant to it.<br /><br />even small parts of the cartoon aren't spared in this butchering. the famous expression "wowsers!" was mysteriously changed to "wowser", and gadget's gadgetmobile now looks different and talks.<br /><br />there is even product endorsements everywhere. why is "yahoo!" advertised on a sign? why does the gadgetmobile have buttons for m&m's or skittles?<br /><br />fans of the cartoon will hate it, others might will likely find the movie below par, and when all is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show.
