this is indeed a god adaptation of jane austen's novel. compared with the american version with guinneth paltrow, the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book. but the acting was awful. besides kate beckinsale, who i believe was a true likeness of the emma in the book, all the other actors were trying too hard. mark strong was not the "gentleman" he was supposed to be. he was often rude and offensive, had no feeling whatsoever, and throughout the entire film you could not see his love "growing" for emma at all. this had a terrible effect on kate beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to "resque" her leading role as well as her partner's. moreover, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. hariett smith, played by samantha morton, seemed to have no real attachment to mr. elton, played by dominic rowan. therefore, she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book. the settings of the film are also too poor. the costumes are even more so. i would have imagined emma woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here. the ending is also too long. it is good that it resembles the book's ending, but it is a killer ending for a film. and again, i can see no feeling of happiness in the face of mr.knightley. to conclude, i believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book, but with poor actors. it seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all. i would prefer to see the "lighter" version with paltrow and northam, even if it is clear that it was made to be a "blockbuster", than to watch these actors (excepting the good olivia williams and the better kate beckinsale) ruin the entire script.
