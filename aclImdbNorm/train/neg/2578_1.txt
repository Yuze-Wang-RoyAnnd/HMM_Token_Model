to summarize this movie: without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes. the music is just awful, the humor isn't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks. it seems to me, that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy, who thinks that drinking is cool, women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks. also, the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies, other than a few names and mr. levenstein who is a minor character in this one. the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls. don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the 5.4 rating, because it obviously overrated and doesn't deserve anything above 2.
