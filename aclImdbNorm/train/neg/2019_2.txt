oh man, this s-u-c-k-e-d sucked.... i couldn't even get any camp value out of this......and i sat through the whole thing on showtime.... don't bother waiting around for the 'naked' scenes either.....it's too late and only plastic jenna jameson is involved.. shows how much discretionary cash must be laying around hollywood just to get your name on the closing credits.. i guess showtime had to throw something in at 1am... next time i think i'd even rather be watching espn loop around every 30 minutes...
