this movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in 109 minutes. except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little resemblance to the book. a book full of strong latino characters and they are represent, for the most part, by non-latinos. there is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. and to delete a complete generation is inexcusable. isabel allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read!
