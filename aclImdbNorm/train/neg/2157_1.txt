siskel & ebert were terrific on this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict their separate professional opinions generated. roeper took this show down a notch or two because he wasn't really a film critic and because he substituted snide for opinionated. now, when ben lyons comes on i feel like i'm watching "teen news" -- you know, that kids' news show, hosted by kids for kids? manckiewitz is not much better. it's obvious they've encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives. the idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous. if they are reviewing a non-formula film, they are completely lost. show them something original and intelligent -- they just find it "confusing". wait -- i think i get it ... abc is owned by disney ... disney makes movies for kids. while siskel, ebert, and roper promoted independent films and were only hit-or-miss with the big budget studio productions -- what a surprise: these two guys love the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few indies. plus everyone knows the age group tv advertisers are aiming for. the blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake. in what alternate universe do these guys qualify as film critics?
