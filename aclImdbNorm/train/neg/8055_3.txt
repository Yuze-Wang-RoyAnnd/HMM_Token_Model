the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend. her aunt (edna may oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn't like wheeler--a sentiment i can easily relate to. the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler. they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. at about the same time, woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. so when wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.<br /><br />i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s. i have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers! despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood (cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey), i can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. for example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother's film, duck soup, yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. at times, woolsey talked a bit like groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! in fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. his only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. additionally, wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as "who's on first" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. in fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. i knew that "who's on first" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.<br /><br />once again, i have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly (such as silly billies and the rainmakers--which i actually gave 6's to on imdb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey. where was all the humor?!
