you ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason? well, out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the t-rex. knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the t-rex from jurassic park, i knew i had to rent this just cause i was in the mood for a bad movie.<br /><br />i was not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives, and of course, a big, poorly animated, sock-puppet t-rex. is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies? not to mention the rex's hungry is never satisfied...ever. how he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn't have an throat (really if you look down his mouth when he roars, it's solid...like a toy or something). now, i like watching incredibly bad b-movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is. this one was hilarious. i'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, make no mistake, you will laugh. <br /><br />do i blame the movie's budget...yes, but the acting didn't help either. ok, tony todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles...when you cry shouldn't "tears" come out? meh, i am not going to be angry at this movie, i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what i recommend: watch this movie, then immediately watch jurassic park and then lost world back to back. you will be writing mr. spielberg thank you letters the next day.
