why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers? that point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie.<br /><br />i think sports movies fall into two categories; well made movies about the human spirit and competitions, and `by the sword'.<br /><br />honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be, a touching drama for trying to be your best in life, an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick. in the end it didn't do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it.<br /><br />for the record i also am a fencing instructor (and now i am officially as bad as the rest). but putting bad fencing in a movie doesn't make it bad automatically. i mean look at star wars (episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fencing). i liked those movies. but when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effort.<br /><br />don't be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing. this is just a bad movie. in the end, this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells.<br /><br />when i see a movie and am forced to think, `man, i wish i was watching the mighty ducks.' i know that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby that will somehow give me two hours of my life back.
