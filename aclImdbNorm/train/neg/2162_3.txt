i do not believe all the praise for this movie. the play and movie were a ripoff of sleuth. michael caine wishes he were olivier, and reeves wishes he were caine. caine even had the nerve to do a remake of sleuth with jude law playing his original part. jude law? you mean the one that did the remake of "alfie"? <br /><br />this movie was made during a period of caine's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts. he would do anything for money. he would star in such award winning movies such as this, and "beyond the poseidon adventure". what seems to be driving the praise for this movie is reeves death. he deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie. and so does caine. this movie can be found in the $5.97 bin at walmart. along with gems like "the island", and "blame it on rio".
