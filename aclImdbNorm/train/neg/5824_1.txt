i thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful. it was slow, pretentious, and boring. i almost fell asleep. there are some decent songs, but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out "yaowwww!" while someone taps randomly on a wooden object. that being said, there are some pretty songs, but it's not worth seeing hte movie over. go on itunes (they have the album), preview it, and choose the good ones. <br /><br />half the movie is some guy making tea. well, that's a slight exaggeration. but you'll see what i mean if you see it. that being said: don't see it!
