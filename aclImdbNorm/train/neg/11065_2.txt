this movie had so much potential. anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it's ridiculous. too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. where was the character development? the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception. where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals? instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer, but fail to address the major point in dahmer's development. also, the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this; his cannibalism and his desire for flesh, etc. i could go on, but to sum up, too many lagging points in the film, focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore - the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is "dahmer."
