previous comment made me write this. it says that muslims are blonde and serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). this comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist.look,race is nothing.i'm color blind.i look like pierce brosnan but i'm no irish. so what?i might add that i am not 100% serb,that i have some austrian and croat blood within me but whats the point.i'm dark, half-breed?is that so? anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like lantos(producer9and director is racist for me.karadzhic, izetbegovich, milosevic, tudjman they are all monsters and i blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, yuggoslavia. hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back. i am proud of being serb and i am proud of my cousins, austrians,croats,muslims, hungarians, arabs (yes i am from serbia and i have multiethnical family).this movie doesn't show sufferings of serbs or croats within sarayevo,terrible terrorism of street gangs,muslim extremism.i add: i kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers muslim,catholic or orthodox, killed in this war.this film is manipulation with our misery,false humanitarianism's which doesn't help at all.it helps lantos to fill his pockets with more doe,alright!
