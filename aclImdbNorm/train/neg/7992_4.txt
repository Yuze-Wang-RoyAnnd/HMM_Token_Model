i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television. i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man-eating ants. what i didn't remember was how awful it was!!!<br /><br />i recently caught this movie on television late at night. i'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again! suzanne somers (at the pinnacle of her career playing chrissy on 'three's company') plays a vacationer at lakewood manor. constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants' nest. or should i say, a *man-eating ants' nest*!! one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants. one minute he's picking them off his clothes one by one, the next minute he's covered in them. the next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt.<br /><br />if you thought that was pretty far-fetched, you should see myrna loy playing a wheel-chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the manor via helicopter! i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie!<br /><br />the final scenes depict suzanne, robert foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing through straws and covered in ants.<br /><br />that's basically the movie. there's really no "disaster" appeal or "big-star" draw to the film. it was intended to be a 'grand-scale' television event at the time. now, it's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4:00am timeslot on your local television station.<br /><br />if you want to catch suzanne somers at her best, then watch an episode of three's company. if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills, then watch this movie.<br /><br />0/10
