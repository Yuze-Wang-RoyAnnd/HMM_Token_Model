first i'd like to excuse my bad english.<br /><br />i'm not a hostel-hardcore-fan, but i liked that movie nevertheless. live feed, however, sucked big time! i have never seen a gore-movie with superb acting, but hey, who's surprised? the acting in live feed was... well, not there! i've seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something. okey, but not by students in media or acting school. this was no class at all! and what about the story? a really sad rip-off on hostel. and what about the gore? what about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold-sweating? that was the most disappointing about the hole movie! short, quick and no edge. more like an execution rather than a torture. okey, there where buckets of blood, but it didn't even look real. the slaughtering and the violence reminded more of braindead than hostel or any of the saw-movies. and braindead was fun! okey, i laughed at live feed a couple of times, but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun!<br /><br />so instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching live feed, watch anything else!
