i am a big fan of old horror movies, and since i am middle aged, old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920's to 1960's period. i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being creepshow 1, which i thought was great. i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending. all the stories were great though. so why did i like them so much? the characters had some decent development, the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear, and the funny bits were really funny! this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent! i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb.com, lol. when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it's telling you something.....4 of 10. also, romero's expertise is hard to find here, they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard (i don't know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me), and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on. it's shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing (yuck yuck) to see it.
