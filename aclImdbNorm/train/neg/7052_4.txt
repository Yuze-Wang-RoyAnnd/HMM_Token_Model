god this film was just so boring apart from the music which i really loved, i mean what was the point in actually making this movie please anyone who reads this review do not watch this film, it is a waste of time.<br /><br />emraan can act but was really pathetic in this film, i am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie, it was just really bad.<br /><br />celina is just another pretty face with no lack of talent what so ever, she can't act at all, and there was no point of her being in this film, as for the other girl radha she was okay i guess but could have done better.<br /><br />what a waste of time. please buy the great music and don't watch this movie.
