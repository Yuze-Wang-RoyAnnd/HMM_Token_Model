edwin porter's 1903 short film entitled "the great train robbery" bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film. just like melies' "a trip to the moon", critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema. in my eyes, they were right. it had everything from the planning, the actual heist of the train, the murder of an unwanted civilian, and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business
