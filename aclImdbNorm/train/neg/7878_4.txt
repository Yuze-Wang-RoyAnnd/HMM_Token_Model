i am a big fan of the original book and this adaption is simply bad. first of all, it had trouble deciding if it is a kiddie toon or an adult one, that caused a strange mix of an adult story and some pretty violent scenes with a silly little duck that keeps giving "funny" moments in the beginning.<br /><br />but that's hardly important, the film is simply boring, unmoving and not true to the original story. it simply fails to transfer to the picture all the points orwell tried to make to his book.<br /><br />{spoiler}<br /><br />second revolution?!! haven't they guys learned anything?? who be the next napoleon then? benjamin?!!
