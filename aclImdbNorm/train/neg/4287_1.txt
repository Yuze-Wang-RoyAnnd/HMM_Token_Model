i gave timecop a perfect 10, i gave this 1<br /><br />it's story is very boring, and it has only little to do with the original timecop. lots of things from timecop was scrapped, and they put in new stupid stuff instead. this story is taking place in 2060 (if i remember correctly), but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous :confused:<br /><br />and the action scenes are nothing to be happy about, well most of them aren't... only the first one is great... and there aren't many action scenes at all, and they're all pretty short<br /><br />at one point in the story, the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes... no wait, make that two times...<br /><br />in short: don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
