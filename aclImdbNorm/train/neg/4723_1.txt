first of all, i apologize for my english. <br /><br />everybody from ex-yugoslavia who isn't some extreme serbian radical will agree with me. this movie, shows serbian side, and only serbian side. no serbian crimes were represented. luckily, everyone can see that this movie was made by serbians, so there is no neutrality. all ''professionals'' who were interviewed are not professionals at all. some guy only read a book written by some radical serbian, the other one is genocide denier etc.etc.<br /><br />even slovenians were accused in this movie.and the whole war in slovenia lasted for few days, and only because slovenians were lucky.there weren't many serbs in slovenia, and yna couldn't reach slovenia trough croatia (after croatia-serbia war started). every slovenian is outraged by all accusations in this movie. <br /><br />every reasonable croat will agree with one thing: the independence was too early. perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided. however, mentioning wwii and some unrelated things was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything. just imagine japanese throwing nuclear bombs at seattle and washington, and saying that was justified by hiroshima and nagasaki. you will find no evidence about strangled yna soldier, and murdered serbian civilians near vukovar. but you can find the tape with reporter committing that his claims about serbian civilians near vukovar were lies. all over the internet. and the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of vukovar by yna (now on serbian and montenegro side-and 100% full of serbs and montenegrin) and let's not start about the chetnik movement. at the beginning, it was simply a resistance movement. but director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the nazis, including ustashe, ethnic cleansing, and fighting again the yugoslav partisans. there are thousands of other things, but all of it can be easily checked. there are many misleading things in this movie. only few of all accusations are true. every croatian is outraged by this movie. <br /><br />i believe that i don't need to mention srebrenica genocide denial, the genocide that has too many evidence. imagine the movie about holocaust denial. this movie is the same. and according to this movie bosnian muslims in sarajevo bombed themselves. every bosnian muslim is outraged by this movie. <br /><br />somehow director forgot to mention the short occupation of small piece of macedonian (fyrom) land by the serbs. <br /><br />croatians, slovenians, bosnians, and macedonians never entered serbian borders. if you are not serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie, know that serbs have some kind of propaganda that croats, bosnian muslims, and macedonians are actually serbs who made up their history. so...<br /><br />even 50% of serbs will say that this movie is ''little'' extreme and pro-serbian. <br /><br />and serbian radicals are very, very pleased with this movie (there is about 40% serbs who vote for radicals).<br /><br />i think everyone understands my points in here. in this so called documentary is very little truth, and my advice to everyone is: inform yourself before watching this movie. after that, you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations.<br /><br />watch real, neutral documentaries about death of yugoslavia.
