the year 1934 was when shirley temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself. unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here. two of those things were singing and dancing. another was a short, interesting film that kept people's attention and got their minds off the depression. you know the other keys to shirley's successful films.<br /><br />this film achieved none of the above, despite the star presences of gary cooper and carole lombard and despite a very good director in henry hathaway. in addition, there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring, and too many arguments between a sullen lombard and cooper. to top it off, you didn't get the normal feel-good ending which is what the public wants. i guess they learned after this movie.
