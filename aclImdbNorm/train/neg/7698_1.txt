can i give this a minus rating? no? well, let me say that this is the most atrocious film i have ever tried to watch. it was painful. boringus maximus. the plot(?) is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. i rented this film with a friend and, after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better, we decided to "fast forward" a little to see if things would get any better. it never gets better. this film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls, sounds interesting, but, in reality, it is just a bore. nothing even remotely interesting ever happens. if you ever get the chance to watch this, do yourself a favor, try "plan nine from outer space" instead.
