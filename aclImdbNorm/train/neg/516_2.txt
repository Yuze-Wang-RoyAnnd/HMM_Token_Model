ever notice how in his later movies burt reynolds' laugh sounds like screeching brakes?<br /><br />must have been hanging out with hal needham too much.<br /><br />and from the looks of "stroker ace", way too much.<br /><br />can you believe this was based on a book? neither could i, but it was. and probably not a best-seller, i'll wager. <br /><br />burt's another good-old-boy in the nascar circuit who hitches up with beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team. anderson provides what love interest there is and nabors does his umpteenth gomer pyle impression as faithful mechanic/best friend lugs. <br /><br />a lot of people here are friends of burt's or hal's. others must have needed the work. and even real nascar drivers get in on the act, and look to have more talent than those with sag cards. <br /><br />as far as laughs go, bubba smith (pre-"police academy") gets them as beatty's chauffeur. and petersen, in full elvira mode, gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know lugs real well. real well.<br /><br />it's a shame that burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like "stroker ace" where it didn't matter whether he bothered to act or not. they didn't bother to write a character for him, why bother to act?<br /><br />two stars. mostly for petersen, and for the out-takes at the end. now they're funny.
