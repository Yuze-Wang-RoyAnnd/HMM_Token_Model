it's hard to know what was going through per kristensen and morten lindberg's heads when they wrote "gayniggers from outer space" - the movie is billed as a comedy, yet there are no real jokes beside the crude character names (capt. b. dick, sgt. shaved balls). the rest of the movie is a (presumably) unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronised voice-overs (with the 'actors' basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling), 'futuristic' computer displays filled with spelling mistakes, and a plot that makes almost no sense.<br /><br />even though 65% of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, this is the complete opposite of what a good film is. it may be entertaining to watch with some friends, but this film only deserves about a '2' out of ten...slightly higher than the lower possible rating only because of the sheer fact that the writers somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this movie.
