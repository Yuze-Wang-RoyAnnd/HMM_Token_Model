"the leap years" is a movie adapted from an e-novella by singapore writer catherine lim, which became the first singapore novel/novella to be sold over the internet. the film had a tortuous post-production schedule: shot in early 2005, it was slated for release at the end of 2005, but only turn up eventually 3 years later, on the 29th february 2008, a leap year.<br /><br />before i say anything, i must first admit i'm no fan of the romance genre, so i may be a little biased against this film - i watched it merely because it was a singapore production, and that it's available for borrowing at my neighborhood library. here's my two cents on the movie.<br /><br />let's just start by saying that other than qi yu-wu's ks and wong li-lin, everybody here of note seems to be a eurasian. the love interest is a eurasian (ananda everingham), and wong's trio of buddies are all, er-hem, eurasians. does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with eurasians are more "in" than the common chinese (or whatever asian race you are?) i don't know, it sure seems that way. also, everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical "anglified" accent which doesn't exist anywhere, certainly not in singapore. it's the kind of "semi-perfect english" that authorities would like us speak, but which doesn't exist anywhere outside, say, the mtv channel. the effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted, not helped by the lack of true-blue singaporeans in the cast.<br /><br />the scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string one-liners after one-liners. after twenty minutes, the "wit" of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clich'es. <br /><br />i guess i didn't enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable. <br /><br />there are other incredulities in the film. i can't for one believe that ks (played by qi yu-wu) would fall for one of wong's girlfriends. and the scene where the bridegroom says, "go, before i change my mind," has been used in a hundred east asian (korean, chinese, hong kong, taiwanese etc) tv serials...<br /><br />so 4 stars for this film. the production value is fair, and wong li-lin tries her best, but she's not helped by the script. joan chen has a 15-minute bit-part in the movie as the older wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot, but, hey, her role is just cameo.<br /><br />if you come across "the leap years" in the rental or library, you may want to pop it in the dvd player for curiosity's sake, but otherwise, for people who don't exactly enjoy the romance genre, you can decide whether or not to give it a miss.
