ah, the sex-and-gore movie. it's too bad they don't make these anymore (unless you live in japan). but if they all turned out like this, that is not a bad thing.<br /><br />the movie basically consists of the two lovely vampires picking up "johns" along a country road, taking them home to their castle, having crazy sex with them, and then eating them (except the first victim, who they keep around for no particular reason). things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women she keeps seeing. it gets real ugly from here. by the end, the two vamps are in such a bloodlust that they're eating everything in sight, and manage to let their captive victim escape. oops, so much for that secret existence.<br /><br />the fact that the two vampyres don't mind taking their clothes off and fooling around with each other is the only thing this movie has going for it. otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing mess (why is their tomb so far away from their castle?), watchable only for the scant few minutes of vampyre playtime. the only thing i got out of this movie was these two valuable bits of advice: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires, and, don't pick up hookers along a country road; they are probably vampires. other than that, it really wasn't worth my time.
