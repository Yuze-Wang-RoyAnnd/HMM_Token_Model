i couldn't relate to this film. it failed to engage me either intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. the dialogue was very dense and uninvolving. i couldn't connect with and hence care about any of the characters and i'm finding it hard to find much that's positive to say about it.<br /><br />i've read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of catholic theology. i'll admit that, as an atheist, i probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of catholicism, but i have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and don't rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs.
