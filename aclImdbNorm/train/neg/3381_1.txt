this may be the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ever. even the music has been destroyed. attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring false. i will say, though, that it is almost bad enough to be funny.<br /><br />the hairstyles are remarkably dated. i can not for the life of me understand what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where "a chorus line" is playing. are we to think that these people are auditioning for "a chorus line," which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning? oh no, the show is collapsing on itself.<br /><br />i saw the original production, and have listened to the album hundreds of times. why, oh, why, did they do this?
