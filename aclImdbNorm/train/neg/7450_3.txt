i have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that i could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: dennis quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. danny glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. also, jared leto was not believable as the former medicine student. the tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. the finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. all we could wait for was the end of the movie. all in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.
