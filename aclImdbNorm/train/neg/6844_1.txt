i have copy of this on vhs, i think they (the television networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years. so that we don't forget what was and that we remember not to do the same mistakes again. like putting some people in the director's chair, where they don't belong. this movie rappin' is like a vaudevillian musical, for those who can't sing, or act. this movie is as much fun as trying to teach the 'blind' to drive a city bus.<br /><br />john hood, (peebles) has just got out of prison and he's headed back to the old neighborhood. in serving time for an all-to-nice crime of necessity, of course. john heads back onto the old street and is greeted by kids dogs old ladies and his peer homeys as they dance and sing all along the way.<br /><br />i would recommend this if i was sentimental, or if in truth someone was smoking medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. either way this is a poorly directed, scripted, acted and even produced (i never thought i'd sat that) satire of ghetto life with the 'hood'. although, i think the redeeming part of the story, through the wannabe gang fight sequences and the dance numbers, his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleaned up. <br /><br />forget sonny spoon, mario could have won an oscar for that in comparison to this rap. oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself silly and three-quarters embarrassed, be sure to drink first. <br /><br />and please, watch responsibly. (no stars, better luck next time!)
