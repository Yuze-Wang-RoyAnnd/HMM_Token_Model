phew--i don't what to say. this is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers. some of the acting reminded me of john waters' early offerings. perhaps i should take that back--i don't want to insult waters' ability as a director/storyteller.<br /><br />i particularly loved the lawyer taking about the "full faith and credibility" clause. it's "full faith and credit," by the way!<br /><br />this also reminds me of "the conrad boys," where the main actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc. those sort of multi-involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability (albeit a stunt, some might say) to pull something off like that.
