i like monster movies, generally. even if they are implausible and silly. but its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly and tries to take itself seriously all at the same time. like in a really posh kind of way.<br /><br />while the idea is somewhat factual, like orcas are known for killing great white sharks, its really hard to find it scary when i can't help but just see an angry shamoo destroying stuff. especially that one scene where some building exploded cause of the orca's doing...and while it explodes, the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like i was watching a show at sea world with fireworks. plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they're going to happen. on top of that, it takes a few jabs at jaws. its like "hey look, we're being factual and we can come up with better reasons why the orca is attacking".<br /><br />yes you are, ignoring your outrageous **** ups in logic of course. but jaws had one thing your movie doesn't. its scary. yes its implausible. yes its somewhat outrageous. but quite frankly, factual or not, a killer shark is not close to being as scary as a great white. and the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more. even jaws the revenge is scarier than this.
