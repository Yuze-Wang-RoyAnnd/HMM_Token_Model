to make any film about the supposed end of the world, there should be some facts & realism 1. we are never told why these people believe this. 2.location is new years eve in toronto canada . so please some one tell me why was then still shining at midnight & why(based on the costumes) did it seem like september<br /><br />3. the acting was in that neo-au-natural style, that needed a director who knew how to do it.<br /><br />4. the individual story pieces were all dreary & without any purpose. i could go on, but i do not want to make this as boring as the film.<br /><br /> rating *1/2 (out of 4) 2 on imdb scale<br /><br />thank you i am as always<br /><br /> jay harris (aka)sirbossman
