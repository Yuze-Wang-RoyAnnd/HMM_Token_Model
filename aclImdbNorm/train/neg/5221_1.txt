hello i am from denmark, and one day i was having a film evening with my friends. one brought this movie with him "russian terminator" and it was extremely awful. after watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable "highlights" or should i say "lowlights" in the movie. i was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my homeland denmark...that must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made.
