feh. this movie started out in an interesting manner, but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull. the confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning, where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so. the dull comes later, with a tepid romance between the two living people(pusses both). the vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film, which is sad. if the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber, the movie might have been better.<br /><br />maybe. because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile, as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead, with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well, take on solid human form, and most likely start killing off everybody. a sort of japanese mystical night of the living dead type thing. but this doesn't come to pass. even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual, she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter. no mass rising of the dead, no walking army of corpses, nothing. the priest merely makes the girl's spirit go back to the land of the dead, taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her, as she'd crushed his spine like peanut brittle(at which point i was tempted to cheer loudly, as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the dead girl,,ewwww!!!). the robitussen sucking, spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time, and that's it. no real horror, no real creepiness, which the japanese tend to do far better than american film makers with their emphasis on over-the-top cheesy face make-up, no screaming mimis. i was very disappointed.
