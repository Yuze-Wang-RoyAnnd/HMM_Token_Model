(very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /><br />normally a fan of diane keaton, i tried to watch this tonight. i had to switch it off before the second hour because i found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. both came across as self-absorbed with little regard for others, with the daughter also adding in rude, disrespectful and reckless to the mix. when the daughter died, the only thing i thought was, "at least we won't have to watch her anymore." keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving, but it was too far gone for me by then. i simply wasn't enjoying it, so i stopped watching. if you want me to care for the protagonist, you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner--if it's nearly an hour in and i don't care, it's too late.<br /><br />the supporting cast was sincere and well played--i felt for *them!*--and the gay best friend was wonderful, but even combined, that wasn't enough to carry the film for me.
