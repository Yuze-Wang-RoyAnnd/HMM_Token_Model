no mention if ann rivers siddons adapted the material for "the house next door" from her 1970s novel of the same title, or someone else did it. this lifetime-like movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough. having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. you know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course, one can't find in this version we watched.<br /><br />the film's star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. from the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, ms. boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera. that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved better.<br /><br />the film has a feeling of a cross between "desperate houswives" with "the stepford wives" and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness. the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting.
