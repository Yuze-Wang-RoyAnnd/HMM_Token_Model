drones, ethnic drumming, bad synthesizer piping, children singing. the most patronizing "world music" imaginable. this is a tourist film, and a lousy one. what really kills it is the incoherent sequences. india, egypt, south america, africa, etc, etc. no transitions, no visual explanation of why we're suddenly ten thousand miles away, no ideas expressed in images. just a bunch of footage of third-worlders with "baskets on their heads" as another reviewer said. walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning. if these guys wanted to make a 3rd world music video, all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of koya were shot, and film in mexico. that would have been a much better setting for "life in transformation."<br /><br />but no. what they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and mind-deadeningly overcranked filter shots. the only thing to recommend this film is that it doesn't suck quite as much as naqoyqatsi.<br /><br />rstj
