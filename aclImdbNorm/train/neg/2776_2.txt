the king maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the portuguese occupation in indochina.<br /><br />although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still fails to impress the viewer. the acting, in particular, was extremely poor. some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely irritating. the storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson. the movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an asian version of elizabeth.<br /><br />final say? costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion. in short, the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script.
