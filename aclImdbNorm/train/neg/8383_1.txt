...ever. this is the bottom. i am not joking. the theater should've had a warning of some kind. 'abandon all hope ye who enter here' would've been fitting.<br /><br />i don't have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is. its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse. this movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. the story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute bugs bunny cartoon and then stretched like mr. fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes.<br /><br />i remember when the wayans's were funny. i guess the pressures of hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate. i'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick-in-the-balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon.<br /><br />i disliked nearly everything about this movie. i won't spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with marlon wayans's face poorly superimposed over the midget's body. what i did like was the ending. not the movie's resolution, but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out.<br /><br />i gave this movie one star, but it clearly deserves less. i don't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star. this does deserve a razzie and i pray to god it gets it.<br /><br />when are people going to learn; if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out. seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film. avoid it at all costs. you have been warned.
