absolutely dreadful mexican film supposedly based on a short story by edgar allan poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc... when our hero, gaston, is given the grand show by dr. maillard, head of the asylum, we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific, such as men hanging around long in a dungeon, and comedic, such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building. then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both: a human man dressed as a chicken, yes, that's right a chicken, that pecks around the ground for chicken feed. the scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film, but, at least for me, it was the film's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining. ah! that is indeed the real horror that is dr. tarr and his legion of name changes. and that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem. yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems and others, of which this is one, have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once. this is definitely garbage. it has very little going for it. the only performer worth having a look at is claudio brook as the head of the asylum. he is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally, bellows orders, sashays with sword in hand, and praises the chicken. i got so tired of hearing him talk about the "soothing system" as his means to cure the mentally sick. what a bunch of ludicrosity(hey, a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word). it won't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting. cinematic chicken scratch!
