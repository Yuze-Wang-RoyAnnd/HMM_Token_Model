this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen, as it's absolutely god awful, john carradine has very limited screen time. all the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus i could see the two twists at the end coming miles away!. the great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn't so damn boring, and there isn't one character to root for either, plus i hope it makes it's way to the bottom 100, because it deserves to be there in my opinion. when john carradine finally shows up at the end, it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late, and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks, plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by bee's, as it was rather gory. i got this in a dvd horror set called back from the grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion, plus it's lucky this was included in a set i bought otherwise i would have chucked this out the window!. this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen, as it's absolutely god awful, john carradine has very limited screen time, and i say avoid it like the plague!, you don't want to go through the torture. the direction is absolutely terrible!. carl monson does an absolutely terrible! job here, making every thing look cheap, wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace. the acting is just as bad. john carradine is good in his scene, but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes. (carradine ruled!!). merry anders overacts here terribly as laura, as she didn't convince me at all. ivy bethune is ok, and somewhat creepy, but also overacted, she did have a creepy smile at the end though. rest of the cast, i didn't pay enough attention too, as i had a lot of trouble getting through it, but they were all really bad. overall please avoid this,it's not worth the agony!. bomb out of 5
