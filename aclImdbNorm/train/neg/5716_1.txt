this film is not deserved of the next few minutes i will spend criticizing it, but i know many people, like myself, rely on imdb.com to assist in deciding on films. for that reason alone, i am writing this.<br /><br />"live feed" is like an asian version of 1976's "the incredible torture show" (aka "blood sucking freaks") http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/. torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism... sure, it's all here along with a third-grade script, pathetic acting, and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy.<br /><br />the film takes place in china, yet everyone speaks english. there is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace, yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor. one gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend (how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film.) the film is absolutely awful, even for a b-movie. even if you were to download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
