i am not an artistically inclined individual. i am a science minded woman and i felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget. i watched part of it with my fianc'e and my future step daughter. we tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. my fianc'e and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to ocean's 13,but that is another story. not to be deterred i awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot. i began again watching this movie in earnest. i just don't get it,i thought i would get it.i thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers. interesting and still it had dead stuff inside. it was an odd and bizarre movie. maybe this is what they were after,however i won't be tricked a second time!
