first of all yes i'm white, so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race... anyway... white people hating black people = bad but black people hating white people = ok (because apparently we deserved it!!). where do i start? i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene were ice cube and co. get in a fight with some really big, really strong, really really angry and scary looking neo-nazis and win!!! the neo-nazi where twice the size :), and the chase! the chase is priceless... this is not a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it doesn't deliver... this is a racist movie that re-affirm all the clich'e stereotypes, the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead...cmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing it.<br /><br />save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written ,poorly acted, dull and clearly biased picture, if you are into the subject, go and rent american history x, now thats a movie
