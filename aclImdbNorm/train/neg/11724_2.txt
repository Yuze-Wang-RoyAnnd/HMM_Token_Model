i once used wesley snipes' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new, untried film in which he appears. so now, for the first time, my snipes-method of film recommendation has failed. utterly. i should first have come here to see these reviews.<br /><br />snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in "the contractor".<br /><br />one of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition. i feared that the shaky, blurry, pseudo-documentary, "unconsidered" directing and editing style (first brought to my attention by the paul greengrass-directed "bloody sunday") might propagate to other films. greengass' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the bourne trilogy films. my fear had come to pass. in my opinion, these films are made really bad by these motion-sickness-inducing methods, which mistake blurry swipes for "action-enhancement". but the "bourne franchise," as greengrass so loving calls his cash cow, apparently convinced others in hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast, big bucks.<br /><br />read my lips, you hollywood types. action needs to be clearly photographed and presented, not merely hinted at by poor, lazy cinematographic techniques.<br /><br />and "the contractor" goes so far as to emulate "the bourne ultimatum" in inanely-repeated sound bites, in hopes their juvenile (apparently-evaluated) audiences can't sense them. for example, if i hear a cop radio crackling "yankee-romeo" one more time, i'll just scream. the chances are good i won't hear it again: i certainly won't ever view "the contractor" again.<br /><br />i recommend to those of you who have yet to see "the contractor": just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life.<br /><br />2 out of 10; i am tempted to lower that to a 1.
