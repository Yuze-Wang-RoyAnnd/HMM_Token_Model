i'm afraid that i have to disagree with the majority. i found spike lee's latest a wee bit boring! although he was trying something different, i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, i don't think it worked too well.<br /><br />there's really a bit too much going on - vinny (john leguizamo) and dionna's (mira sorvino) relationship, ritchie's (adrien brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. the story is good, but at the end thats all you have - 2 or 3 stories. with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film? ><br /><br />there are some good points though. all scenes with the 'son of sam' killer david berkowitz look very nice (colour saturation etc...)and the acting is pretty good throughout.<br /><br />overall i felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings. it just wasn't strong enough in the end.<br /><br />
