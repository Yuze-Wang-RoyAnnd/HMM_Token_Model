what a boring film! to sum it all up, its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter-in-law karisma kapoor, while she tried to flee from the village, with her son. can someone say boring??? the concept wasn't too bad, but it was poorly executed. the canadian locales, and some of the village scenes were nicely shot. however, overall the cinematography came up short. the story could have been great, but the movie just seemed to drag on. there is only so much stupidity a person can take, let alone three bloody hours of it.<br /><br />the best part of the whole movie was the song "ishq kamina", and that was only five minutes long. other than that, this movie was a piece of crap.
