a family looking for some old roadside attractions to include in the father's coffee-table book come across an ancient, decrepit old freak show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. when their family van breaks down upon leaving the sideshow, they're forced to stay at a nearly abandoned fishing camp that was the site of a prison break decades prior.<br /><br />there have been many films in the 'freak' subgenre of horror, ranging from tod browning's beloved 'freaks' (1932) to alex winter's hilarious 'freaked' (1993). those are both classics (or soon-to-be with 'freaked'). 'side sho,' however, never will be. and if it ever does reach classic status. . . well, it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our genre. from the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17-year-old daughter that's obviously older than her natural mother, this film did not have much going for it. the writing was subpar, but not completely awful. . . just boring. the direction was poor, and the rare freak effects were pretty horrendous and unbelievable. the acting was abysmal and the casting was even worse. anyone who would believe the ages of these two camp-age teenagers must not have met a teenager in a long, long time. there was far from enough gore & violence to make up for the lack of any other quality. . . and when there was a bit of violence, it was not well done at all. and, i can't forget to mention the ending fight scenes which were, with all honesty, some of the worst i've ever, ever seen in a film. overall, this is an easily forgettable and poorly made horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar bin.<br /><br />final verdict: 2.5/10.
