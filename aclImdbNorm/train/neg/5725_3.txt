2005 gave us the very decent "gore porn" flick hostel, and 2006 gave us live feed; a not so decent rip-off of hostel. live feed follows pretty much the same formula as eli roth's earlier film, except this time the dumb kids are in asia rather than central europe. the plot focuses on these dumb kids, and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble. the locals decide to lock them all in a theatre, and kill them. despite the fact that i'd heard some less than favourable things about this film before seeing it, i still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director ryan nicholson previously made the very decent 45 minute rape and revenge film 'torched', but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous or boring. the film is obviously trying to hark back to the good old days of grindhouse cinema (which hostel did, successfully), but it really doesn't come off. surprisingly, considering nicholson's previous work in special effects - not even the gore is impressive...although it is a lot better than the acting! there's not much else i can say about this film...it's bad and not in a good way. avoid it!
