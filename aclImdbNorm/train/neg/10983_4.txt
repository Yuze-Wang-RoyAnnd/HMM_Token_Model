when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago, it would have been something quite different for the time. so therefor some people would have found it quite scary, and may well have been impressed with the special effects?<br /><br />looking at the play in this day and age, it doesn't seem to be all that scary anymore, even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel? i don't think so......but if you watch this play again, you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel, rushes straight through the red light! (maybe that's how it was in dickens time)?<br /><br />you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state. surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting. (i can't help but notice things like that)<br /><br />i will not take anything away from the acting, both denholm elliott (signalman) and bernard lloyd (the traveller) gave wonderful performances.<br /><br />i am not at all sure what is going on......i mean was the ghost the traveller, or what??? does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story??? (well maybe i am the only one that don't)???<br /><br />to sum up.....<br /><br />the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout, with great character. it suffers from not being that scary these days, and a little if not very confusing in places, and has some rather unusual signalling practises....<br /><br />thanks for reading my review.
