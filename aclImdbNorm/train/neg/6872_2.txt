this show had pretty good stories, but bad dialog. the main character was especially annoying. it's quite obvious why this show was canceled, although, like most upn shows, i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re-runs.<br /><br />most of it's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies, leading me to think the producers didn't have an original idea in their heads. <br /><br />i haven't commented enough. you've got to have at least ten lines of text. the special effect were not bad for a 2001 show.<br /><br />the gnome was a nice character.
