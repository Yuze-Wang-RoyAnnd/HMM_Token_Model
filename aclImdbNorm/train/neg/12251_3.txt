oh, cgi. a blessing when used properly. a sin with it's used by people who have no idea what their doing. sadly, that's not the only thing that's used poorly in this umpteen jaws rip-off.<br /><br />ok, anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things. 1: i like low-budget horror movies. and 2: if there is a cute guy in said low-budget movie, i'll usually point them out. so, let's just get this out of the way right now. this is one low-budget horror movie i didn't like. the acting, for the most part, is horrible, effects laughable, and the script rivals battlefield earth as the worst i've witnessed this year. as far as the resident cute boy...dax miller (bog) wins that prize hands down. this boy is hot! and surprisingly, he's not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt...he can actually act (well, as much as he can in this odious film). now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way, let's get on with it.<br /><br />in cliff notes version, here's the story (don't worry, i'll try not to give anything away)...<br /><br />a film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers (established cute boy and his buddy) who surf with sharks. unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island. croc shows up, mayhem ensues, and people are eaten. roll end credits.<br /><br />as i said earlier, this film pretty much blows. it started pretty well, but soon devolved into being silly and stupid. a main character becomes lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining heros utter one-liners at the victims expense. also, if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water, what's with all the sharks around? if this thing can eat a 40 foot boat, i don't think a few skimpy sharks would stick around. the fx is some of the worst i have ever had the displeasure to see. the cgi is horrendous, and they've even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs. attention, filmmakers. national geographic. discovery store. the croc hunter. they know what crocodiles look like. you obviously didn't reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film. and what's with the pirate/drug pusher gang? did you just need another reason to rip off a woman's top? <br /><br />it's funny how we get little sub-genres in the movie world. with alligator and it's sequels, lake placid, crocodile, and now blood surf, it now looks like "over-sized crocodile/alligator" movies should now get their own category at blockbuster. alligator was good. lake placid was good. i even thought tobe hooper's crocodile was good. blood surf, sucked.<br /><br />my grade: d-
