simply, i found the tv show "mash" trite, preachy, oh ever so "politically correct", repetitious, pretentious and biggest sin of all, and that is,? that it is (was) incredibly dull. you have alan alda as the main lead, "(star)", who is so in love with himself and his cleverness, that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode. the original series had both mclean stevson, and wayne rogers, whom i'll happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation. however, harry (henry) morgan, and mike farrell, both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with wonder bread. loretta swit, which i also found dull, also to no fault of her own wasn't a wonder to look at, and gary burghoff, who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on. seeing one show a year showed that to me. jamie farr was just low brow "comedy" and is not even worth really mentioning here at all. the reason i did not give it a (one) rating, which anyone reading this by now would be wondering, is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call, but a relative one. television, except for relatively few exceptions, is such crud. that relatively speaking, mash had some production quality, (by television standards) of that era and today, and therefore it is deserved of a two. rob ritter
