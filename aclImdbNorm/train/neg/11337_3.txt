i am normally a spike lee fan. it takes some time to really get into his "mojo", but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart, lee is a genius. unlike the 25th hour or bamboozled (two of my favorite films of his), there was no clear story in this film. i was able to understand the struggle between washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others, but for some odd reason lee was never able to get the true feeling out. washington did a decent job with what was handed to him, but you could tell that this was not lee's favorite film. not only did lee direct this film, but he also wrote it. you could tell. the camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film. this film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty. lee was not 100% behind this film as he was with do the right thing. of all the films i have seen lee direct, this was the brightest and more modest of his films. it was almost as if he created a hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own. i don't know if he saw the money from do the right thing and ran with it, or what
