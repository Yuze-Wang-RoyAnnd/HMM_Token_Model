well i just paid a dollar for a dvd of this movie, and it wasn't even worth that. it seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain, i am guessing.<br /><br />neagle - despite her glory, awards, and reputation - is a homely british gal who can't sing or dance or act.<br /><br />some of the fine old hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic. director herbert wilcox (neagle's husband) always thought anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen. he was mistaken. she was improbably popular in britain before and after wwii. her "serious" roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here.<br /><br />only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented. skip this one and find the one that stars doris day. at least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing!
