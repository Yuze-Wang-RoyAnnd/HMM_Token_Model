if you are going to attempt building tension in a film it is always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total tedium.<br /><br />unfortunately the butcher brothers haven't grasped this yet.<br /><br />this film sucks, unlike the majority of its characters who (if you didn't work out they are vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you) preference stringing up the plentiful supply of 'no one knows where i am' cheerleader types and homosexual drifters that waft conveniently and with a fast food swagger, past their isolated door.<br /><br />the only tiny bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place but the rest of it is ludicrous and sloppy.<br /><br />forced to up sticks (as opposed stakes) on a regular basis due to their penchant for filling their basement with bloodless corpses, they really are none too bright. if they fed their victims they could run their own little blood farm and it would cut down on the mortality rate, thereby allowing them to settle down and get chintzy.<br /><br />why the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the homicidally gay older brother i am not sure. it added zero to the plot, which was unfortunate given that there wasn't a great deal of plot to start with and had no shock value at all.<br /><br />one was never told why the parents had died, unless of course that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. clearly the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or other but again, it was for the viewer to write their own reason.<br /><br />the only well rounded character was the youngest brother who emerges looking like pugsley from the adams family. indeed he was way too rounded, having the appearance of a child who has inadvertently wandered from a weight watchers' class in to a very bad horror film. oh heavens, he had. never mind dear, have another doughnut with a yummy blood centre.
