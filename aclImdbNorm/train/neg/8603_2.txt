this could have been a rather entertaining film, but instead it ranks with other duds like leeches and rest in pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. had they played this flick tongue-in-cheek, it could have been a very entertaining film, like re-animator or dead alive, but juan piquor simon plays it tongue-in-cheek in spots but straight more often.<br /><br />the premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs. there is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive, meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot. health inspector michael garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. the climax is a laugh riot - unintentional at that - which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and screenwriter) the scenario of destroying the slugs is.<br /><br />story: $$ (no new ground charted here. simon seems to play the gore elements tongue-in-cheek but the dialogue is straight. had simon worked with a clever script - one with plenty of one-liners and eccentric characters, this could have been a cult film).<br /><br />violence: $$$ (you won't be letdown here. we get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine italian restaurant. the blood and guts, that many horror film watchers enjoy, is in full swing here. you also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes).<br /><br />acting: $ (wow! michael garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film-making endeavor is. kim terry, as his wife, does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold-your-face-while-you-scream bit. the "teenagers" were all horrible actors - no exceptions. man, this film could have used bruce dern or jeffrey combs!) <br /><br />nudity: $$ (two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched - in a poorly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's bedroom. both male and female nudity here).
