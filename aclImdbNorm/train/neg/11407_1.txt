this movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie. jacob have i loved is quite possibly the worst film that i have ever seen. there is no storyline, plots disappear, and the editing is awful. to top it all off, the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible. bridget fonda's acting is decent, but everyone else's acting is totally amateur. i would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut-scenes, bad transitions and acting that should have been re-shot! read the book and don't waste your time with this film.
