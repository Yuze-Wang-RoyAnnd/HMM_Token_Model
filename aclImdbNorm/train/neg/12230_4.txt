michael williams, who works for bbc, finds a somehow impressive italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled diabolical art: a documentary. but since his wife's mysterious death her daughter, emily, has been emotionally disturbed, so he goes spoleto, where the problematic picture is, with her and her nanny, jill. and there is a countess, who is also a psychic, and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named emilia was executed. michael doesn't believe her story, but after that emily has hysterical spasm and jill is killed... this italian film is, of course, almost innocently influenced by the exorcist, but this one is much cheaper, much simpler,and in a sense, much dirtier. first of all, it should be said this film is full of confusion. for instance, the story shows emily is a reincarnation of emilia. but when emily sees her in the flashbacks, she perceives her exclusively from a third-person's point of view. but if she is the reincarnation of emilia, she should and must see the past from nothing but emilia's point of view. confusions of this kind, which the film has many, are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly, rather than ambivalent, to specify its own quasi-freudian theme, namely, pre-adolescent girl's one-way incestuous wish. to make matters worse, this film also has characteristic problem (if not confusion); every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and/or believable living human. regarding emily (or emilia), she is after all a child, and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness. (and according to the freudian theory, every girl wants to have her father's child(ren) in her own way. in this sense, emily is not exclusively pathological; only her way of excluding other women from her father's love is problematically pathological. but, as i already mentioned, this film per se is too cowardly to be freudian.) the problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as emily is. and because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything down-to-earth, and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way. in addition, special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable. although stelvio cipriani's music is noteworthily beautiful (indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone), the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap b-film which can disappoint even the 1970s'-italian- horror-film-lovers.
