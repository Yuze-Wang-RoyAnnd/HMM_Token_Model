i rented this movie on dvd. i knew that the movie wouldn't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case, but once i saw that leatherface (gunnar hansen) was in it, i had to rent it. it starts off pretty good, with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable. however, the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever, and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging. there are way too many unanswered questions. there was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, but overall this is a very sub par movie, but i guess it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.
