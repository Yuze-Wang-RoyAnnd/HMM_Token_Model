this movie is truly awful. after seeing the advertisement for it, i thought it could have its charms ... but it didn't.the girls cannot act, and they cannot sing either. the soundtrack to this movie is full of their songs, and its not a pretty sight, terrible story line, unbelievable plot, its one of disney's worst movies by far!. ally is not a bad actress on "phil of the future", so i don't know what happened in "cow belles". and her sister, aj, seems to be just hitching a ride on her sisters "fame", and she displays no talent what so ever.<br /><br />at the end of the movie the girls do finally learn some clich'e morals, but this is to late to rescue this train wreck movie.<br /><br />awful
