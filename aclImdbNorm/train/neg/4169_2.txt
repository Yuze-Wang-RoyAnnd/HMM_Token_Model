i gave it a 2 just because natassia malthe (as the vampiress quintana) looks sooooo sexy in this movie.<br /><br />certainly there is very little logic to this movie, but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flicks. the movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories. unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not just unreasonable, but ridiculous.<br /><br />there is too much gore and too many rip-off-the-body scenes that made me feel sick. a good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don't need to see a lot of blood -- we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he/she is going to do what a vampire will do. a few moans or screams are all it needs to describe the scene (like the one at end when quintana tries to sexually arouse rosa, all it needs is a few moans, the rest is your imagination). anyway, it's just my personal taste.
