we went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled. it is without doubt one of the worst movies ever. it is not that i don't like cult-movies i do. but nothing happens in the film. one does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever. endless times without dialog. and the car. how do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car? it is a two seater! i have to say however the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie, so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway.<br /><br /> i would not recommend it, as it is a waste of your time
