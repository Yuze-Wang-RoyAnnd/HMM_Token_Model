the plot of " astronuat returns to earth as a mutating monster " died out in the 1950s mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the earth's orbit doesn't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters , and that the first film to use this plot the quatermass experiment was the only decent sci-fi movie to use the idea . so the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start . alas watching the incredible melting man it seems the plot is the least of its problems <br /><br />first of all this is an incredibly badly made movie . the budget is in single figures and i'm talking about lira not dollars . there is no cinematography to speak of and there's countless editing blunders . for example a photographer takes his ( barely legal ) model for a photo shoot . cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model , then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him, then cut back to the model where the sun is ...<br /><br />the lack of budget drags the film down in other aspects too . according to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers couldn't get any stock footage of saturn so when astronaut steve west mentions how beautiful saturn looks we get footage of the sun . actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human actors wouldn't be employed by a porn studio . if i was appearing in this i wouldn't be scared by the eponymous monster - i'd be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast . perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious lack of budget manifests itself in things like the actors having to wear their own clothes . a general for instance doesn't wear his nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals - he wears a denim jacket and baseball cap <br /><br />there has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level . the tone is set early on in the film where mr melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital . instead of the police getting a call saying there's been a murder dr nelson just decides to track down his patient on his own own same as he'd look for a missing cat . it's also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing , but this is typical of a film where horny 70 year olds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there's a monster on the loose .<br /><br />the incredible melting man is z grade rubbish . i can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of " it's so bad it's good " but apart from rick baker's sometimes impressive make up effects it's nothing more than a very guilty pleasure
