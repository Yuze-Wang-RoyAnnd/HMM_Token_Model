well i just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that i'll never get back on this piece of trash. i heard someone online describe this movie's villains as "subhuman cannibals", and i thought it was promising because i thought it would be like the descent. wrong! the descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline. these villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch. this movie isn't so controversial, i've seen this level of gore in many films. this movie plain sucks. synopsis: a blonde who thinks she's real hot (but she isn't), her admirer, and her admirer's friend (no, i don't remember their names) go into the woods. their car breaks down. they are warned to leave by a man named mark. the blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can't find the admirer's friend. admirer impales his foot (whoops!). don't worry, he is much more upset when his car won't start than when he gets impaled by nails. after a nanosecond of coaxing, the blond leaves to find help. events ensue that i cannot remember. during this and throughout the movie, we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag. blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals (even though all they are seen eating is intestines, which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food). blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard (unsuccessfully) to work up tears. then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can "out think them". mark (the man who warned them to leave) has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family. then there is some shooting, they leave the house, the shooting continues, then a random guy shows up and says he's been watching them. before he is shot, we are shown an acid-trip inspired scene of more killing. the blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them. there's more killing, the admirer professes his love for the blonde. then a mysterious hand covers the camera. what does that imply? i don't know, hopefully not a sequel.
