man, this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books. frankly, i found it too slow and unappealing right from the start. i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened. this movie is vastly overrated.<br /><br />shakespeare, with the king james english, has never appealed to me, anyway, so it may just be me. there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othello.<br /><br />the good points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some decent cinematography and a young, slim and attractive shelly winters.<br /><br />overall, this is simply too boring, too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again. besides, we all know that most actors are nut-cases, anyway, but kudos to hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story.
