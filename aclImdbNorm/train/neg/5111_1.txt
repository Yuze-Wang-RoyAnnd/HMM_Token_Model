i used to be an avid viewer until i personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the white family, only to be sickened to see the house a year later. all of the beautiful rock landscaping has been removed, the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been removed, all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been cut down, sprinkler system has been ripped out. it now looks like a disaster area. they don't even live there any more... they live "in town" and come out only for the weekend. it sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result. the story that we all saw on tv wasn't completely the truth... don't believe every thing you see and hear.
