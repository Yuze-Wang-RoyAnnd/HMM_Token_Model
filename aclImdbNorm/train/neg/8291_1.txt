an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful. so, no new story lines here. however, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting film. if you enjoy watching kids vomiting, or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife's teeth out in a bloody horror-type, go see (or rent) the film. if not, move on to something else (my fair lady, anyone?)
