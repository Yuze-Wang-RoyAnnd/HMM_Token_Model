spoilers: i'm always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews. it was awful. the script and voice acting alone ruined it. gabriel and grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game. you almost pray for their deaths. and worst of all, there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in the beast within.<br /><br />the lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing. if you're expecting some kind of anne rice style vampire story, forget it. this game's story has very little to do with vampires. you won't even see any till about the very end and even then, you won't get to fight them.<br /><br />the story has radical, and pretty much blasphemous, views of christianity. i'm amazed it got off the drawing board. i'm not even christian and i found it offensive. mostly, the story centers around a search for the holy grail and buried treasure. the kidnapping of a royal baby, which should have been the focus, really gets pushed aside. there is no sense of urgency for gabriel to find the baby. in fact, he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocks.<br /><br />the graphics are pretty bad. the characters move about at a snail's pace even on the best of systems. they are chunky and outdated. and it's hard to go from the fmv of the beast within to this horrible game engine for blood of the sacred.<br /><br />the relationship between gabriel and grace takes an awful turn, too. i really don't know why it was so horribly rushed, but they do sleep together. and it's not fun. gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend mosely how he thinks of grace as more of a sister and he doesn't think she's the one for him. and he seems really grossed out that they slept together. but he's so unlikeable throughout the game, that you almost don't even care at that point. his dialogue was the worst in the game. and he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game. by the end of the game, grace leaves him with what appears to be a dear john letter. i guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players were.<br /><br />i found the story to be annoying and boring. i was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires. and i was expecting to get to see and fight vampires, maybe even have gabriel or grace turn into one. but no. instead, the story focused on the author's warped vision of christianity. what a shame. here they had the elements for a great adventure, and instead we got this.<br /><br />for me, the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end. we do get a few action style puzzles at the end. but it wasn't worth suffering through the entire game to get to them.<br /><br />i can't really recommend this game. i had gotten it back when it came out, years ago, and i hated the game engine so much that i shelved it for years. i only recently dusted it off to see what i'd been missing. and now, i'm very sorry that i did. my favorite characters were ruined. i hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series. and i hope they get it right next time. it would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment.
