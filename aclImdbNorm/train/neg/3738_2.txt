that's what the title should be, anyway.<br /><br />this movie combines guns, explosives, and mindless killing to make one flop of an "action" movie. let me make my point in a series of questions: answers type deal.<br /><br />what happens in the movie? people die.<br /><br />is that it? yes.<br /><br />what is the plot about? what plot?<br /><br />what is the point the movie is trying to make? killing is the only solution.<br /><br />what are the characters like? extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities.<br /><br />is there anything good about this movie? yes. i'm sure they used some nice panavision cameras in filming it.<br /><br />if you like constant killing and greed, then watch the movie. if you happen to be repulsed by such low-standard "entertainment", then "made men" is not for you.<br /><br />to sum it up, the plotline stinks, the characters aren't worth their while, the storyline is completely resistable, and nothing fits together.<br /><br />this proves one thing: the actors, directors, and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren't "made".
