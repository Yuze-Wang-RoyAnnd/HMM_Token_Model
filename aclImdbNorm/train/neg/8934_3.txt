i bought this dvd without any previous reference but the names of john huston, raquel welch, mae west and farrah fawcett on its cover. i found the brazilian title very weird, but i decided to watch expecting to see a funny comedy maybe like "switch". however the non-sense story is awful and hard to be described. myron breckinridge (rex reed) is submitted to a surgery to change his sex in copenhagen and he returns to hollywood telling that she is to be myra breckinridge (raquel welch) and claiming half the property of his uncle buck loner (john huston). along the days, myra and her alter-ego myron corrupt a young couple in her uncle's academy with kinky sex. in a certain moment, the messy screenplay is so confused that i believe the whole story was only a mind trip of myron induced by the accident. unfortunately the beauties of raquel welch and farrah fawcett are not enough to hold this flick. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): "homem & mulher at'e certo ponto" ("man & woman up to a point")
