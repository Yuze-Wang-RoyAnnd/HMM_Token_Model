we've been served - a terrible film.<br /><br />okay, i'll admit that since i'm white and have had no practical experience in the "competitive world of step-dancing," i might not exactly be an authority on this type of film. on the other hand, i do know a bad motion picture when i see it.<br /><br />and, boy, have i just seen it.<br /><br />filmed in low-budget-vision and directed by ian iqubal rashid, ("a touch of pink"), "how she move" tells the tale of how important it is to follow one's dreams - even if those dreams include bopping around to loud, irritating hip-hop music and speaking dialogue the average person would not understand if he or she had an international translator.<br /><br />i'll try to give a small synopsis of the "plot." first of all there are two actors that look like ll cool j who work in an auto shop in toronto (the mecca of racial diversity), but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day. <br /><br />there are a few other guys in this "crew," including a token white dude and a guy that looks like denzel washington in "malcolm x." there are also two women in the movie - one resembles serena williams and the other looks like geraldine from the old "flip wilson show." one of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her tuition on a drug-addicted sibling. the other girl, a member of salt n pepa, no doubt, is just plain no good.<br /><br />there's another guy who looks like eddie murphy's buckwheat, while still another actor who's a huggy bear knock-off. these guys are rival step dancers. evidently, this activity is very hard-core in the 'hood, and they are all practicing for the big "step monster" jam in detroit.<br /><br />since i was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue (perhaps some subtitles would have been useful, as in a bergman film or that one music video by snow), it's hard to explain what happens, other than there's a lot of arguing, the serena williams girl (who never smiles, by the way) becomes a freelance stepper (moving from group to group), there's some step-dancing and a lot of irritating hip-hop music.<br /><br />it's a typical rags-to-riches story; sort of like "rocky" with a really bad soundtrack, "rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, "cry freedom" without the laughs. <br /><br />but why does a film - which could have made a big impact on black audiences - have to contain drug addiction, bad parents and a title that sounds like a first-grader saying the phrase, "how she moves"?<br /><br />i was "moved" by this movie, however. moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible.
