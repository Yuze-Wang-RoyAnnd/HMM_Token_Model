using footage pillaged from planet of dinosaurs this shot on video (except for the stolen footage) concerns a bunch of people shot into space who land on a dinosaur planet that is...don't wait for it, is really earth. its a five minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes. slightly better than chickboxer (another in the bad movie police series)-having a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effects, this movie is still an impossible slog to get through. i'm left to ponder the question are we becoming so uncreative that we're now pillaging old movies not only for plot but also for mismatched footage? clearly low budget producers are getting so desperate they really will give us anything to take our money
