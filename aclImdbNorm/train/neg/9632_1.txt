i have an awful pan-and-scan videotape of "boom!", and i want to see it in all its widescreen glory. so i voted "1" and hope you will too. together, we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross, and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money in releasing "boom!" in its director's cut extended version. the movie is one of my howling favorites
