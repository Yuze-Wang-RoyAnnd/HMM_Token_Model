ok.... i just have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and cheesy! the only redeeming feature of this movie is dean cain. other than that - it's cheeseball supreme!!!!<br /><br />the movie does have some promise in the concept - an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon - basically giving us more of "jurassic park" meets "reign of fire"..... there are some great possibilities, but they just don't follow through.... the special effects are decent - even though you know the dragon is cgi, it doesn't horribly look like cgi.... <br /><br />i wouldn't lay the blame on dean cain (although he is one of the producers), i'd lay more of the blame on phillip roth - the director and writer. it's his job to make this film.... and, unfortunately, he failed.
