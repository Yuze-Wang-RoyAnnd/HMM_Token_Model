mindless dribble about the second coming of christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking sandra locke. you have no idea what's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song "suzanne" being played over and over throughout the movie until when "the second coming of suzanne" is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing.<br /><br />this off-the-wall armature movie maker logan,jared martin, is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project. planning to go on his own logan then spots this couple at a seaside caf'e and is fascinated with the young woman suzanne, sandra locke, who reminds him of someone he knew in another life: jesus christ.<br /><br />with logan's assistant and all around gofer clavius, richard dreyfuss,somehow getting a $740,000.00 loan from the bank to finance logan's masterpiece he starts to work on suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film. this leads to suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist simon, paul sand, but later simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out.<br /><br />the movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub-plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl dorothy, kari avalos, who's cured of her autism by suzanne after everyone else, at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to,failed. it's not really known what exactly suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there; was this supposed to show us in the audience that she, like jesus, could miraculously heal the sick?<br /><br />there's also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon jackson sinclair, gene barry, who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or has seen a biblical-like vision that changed his life forever. sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it's all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there's all this suffering in the world, like this movie that he's in, and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on suzanne. sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur david, mark rasmusser, who's gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the pacific coast.<br /><br />the movie "the second coming of suzanne" goes on with a number of unrelated sequences, probably to fill or pad in some time by it's director and film editor, and then goes to it's final scene in a christ-like crucification on a hill as logan has all the cameras rolling. it turns out that the crazed logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate, on the helpless and tied up suzanne, the actual crucification of jesus christ some 2,000 years ago.<br /><br />hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow "the second coming of suzanne" puts you through the same kind torture that suzanne is put through by logan and the makers of the film. the movie tries to be arty but that's just an excuse to cover up it's brainless and non-existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it.
