"the incubus" is a mix of the good (an interesting murder mystery), the bad (a disconnected script, a sloppy resolution, badly made attack scenes) and the weird (strong incestuous overtones, a strangely sleepy and stiff performance by john cassavetes - was that character really meant to be so "wacko"?). not nearly as offensive as it's reputed to be, but not particularly successful, either.
