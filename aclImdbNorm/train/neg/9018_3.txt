this is a formula b science fiction movie, and the director made no bones about it. it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team. everything done is stuff you've seen many times before. it is a weak script, with no real characters. in fact, it is full of stereotype characters and situations. the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie, with no attempt to fool us, and that gives this movie a mild appeal, but it isn't something you're likely to remember a while. it is best seen while you're cooking, cleaning, working out. sort of mindless fun. it has its place in entertainment, but it certainly isn't something you sit down with friends to watch, unless you're all just drunk and don't care. the mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair. i don't think it is as crappy as most people, but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular. that really eludes me, as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film.
