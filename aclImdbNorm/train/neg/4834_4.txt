i was looking forward to kathryn bigelow's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 oscars which it was awarded. unfortunately it really isn't a good movie. the depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts, but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard. the actors put in a good effort, but for me i didn't really get what the movie was trying to be. it's not as atmospheric and gripping as full metal jacket, not as epic as band of brothers, not as action packed as...well, anything. i certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much, nor why people are 'hyping it up' to these epic proportions. mind you, given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years i suppose there's not a lot to choose from.
