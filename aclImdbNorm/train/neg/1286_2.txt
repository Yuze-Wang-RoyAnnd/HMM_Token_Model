how does a scotsman in a kilt make love in the bonny purple heather? very,very carefully.now i have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that i was born in scotland.far too many americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously.it's a joke,people,"four legs good - two legs bad",as orwell had it. jessica lange has an accent that the wells - next - the - sea amateur dramatic society's production of "brigadoon" would turn down. liam neeson - apparently popular with the ladies - wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose great grandmama once stepped off the train at edinburgh waverley. and the auld enemy?where would the scots be without them to hate and blame for everything?messrs roth,cox and hurt should be ashamed for indulging in such racist stereotyping. "robin hood - prince of thieves" seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison.and at least alan rickman was funny.
