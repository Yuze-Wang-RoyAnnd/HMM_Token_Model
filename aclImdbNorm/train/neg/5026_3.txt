flame in, flame out. that seems to be gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon. i'm not a fan of japanese monster films, but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd sci-fi collection put out by mill creek/treeline films. it's a great value at about twenty five bucks, so at fifty cents per movie, it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings.<br /><br />gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast, and he's not happy. like godzilla, he takes it out on tokyo, setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet. they arrive at 'plan z', the hope of the world, and wouldn't you know it, there's a scene where a huge shed is shown that's called the 'z plan' building; that was a nice touch.<br /><br />by the mid 1960's, this country still wasn't quite politically correct. one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee. i guess there weren't any privates around.<br /><br />good old gammera was quite the sight though, walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged. that's why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship, whisking him off to mars to save the world. high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save, now let's get back to the cold war.<br /><br />like godzilla, gammera spawned at least a good dozen films, but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying, flaming turtles. especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has "attack of the monsters" with a featured guest appearance by the big g. it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films; it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said 'gammera, sayonara!"
