i read the back of the box and it talked about mary shelley and percy shelley and lord byron. i thought, "wonderful! this will be great!" i was so wrong. the story was all screwed up. in fact i still don't get it. it just seems to me that all the characters did was drink, smoke (opium?) and have sex. not that those aren't good movie qualities, but please! where was the story? i made myself finish the movie, and yes, it did pick up towards the end, but by then the movie was almost over. rent it if you really want to. just don't trust the back of the box.
