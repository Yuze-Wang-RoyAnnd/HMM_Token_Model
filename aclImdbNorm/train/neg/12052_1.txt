what happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm? homeless people answer to no one. they have no mortgages, rent payments or idiot bosses. homeless people don't have to worry about the irs or performance reviews or credit card payments. but, give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and, suddenly, they have to worry about entering the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance on their car, and working for someone else. they get a chance to be a "productive citizens." this film was about as exploitive as a film can be. it's a way for the rich and middle-class sheeple to say "see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and it vindicates capitalistic arrogance.<br /><br />why not a film that asks, "what happens when you take away everything a rich man has?"
