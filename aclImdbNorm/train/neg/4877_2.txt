frank capra's creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film. while it has a few charming moments, and many wonderful performers, capra's outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story, broadway bill (1934), is downright shoddy. it is understandable that he would re-use footage from the climactic horse race, which is thrilling. but he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors, then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice, for example, that ward bond is 14 years older! unless you want to see one of the last appearances of oliver hardy, skip this one and watch broadway bill instead.
