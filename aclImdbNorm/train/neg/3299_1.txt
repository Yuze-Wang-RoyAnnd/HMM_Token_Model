this must be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i was actually expecting a bad movie but i was caught by surprise believe it or not. the storyline is the traditional, all clich'ees are included.<br /><br />the dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half-descent actors are trying to make it sound real. the photo is not too good, the music is so malplac'ee it actually made me angry, the actors are not even trying, altho the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for 30 years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the "action" itself.<br /><br />i dont understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming, who is financing this shit? where is the screening ? and why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script?<br /><br />there are a million hollywood-movies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters, but even them straight to video things actually manages to look professional in comparison.<br /><br />i can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all, i feel robbed of 2 hours of my life.
