this film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2/3 of the journey. sadly, the film ends up being too 'confused.' while i know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop' films i got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and i lost interest.<br /><br />the filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on. we formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering.<br /><br />in the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could've been an enjoyable piece of escapism. here's what's concerning joe gavilan (harrison ford) at the end of the film:<br /><br />1. his real estate deals 2. his affair with a radio psychic 3. he's being investigated by internal affairs 4. the homicide investigation<br /><br />if you add in casey's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death. now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that i hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen. the impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking.<br /><br />as if a ridiculous chase sequence wasn't bad enough, one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour, wasn't bad enough, joe gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun. all these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught. we already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot-lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension.<br /><br />while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story, i won't. this could've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time. harrison ford and josh hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by gladys knight is worth noting. sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable.<br /><br />while this will probably be better than the likes of "the hulk" and "lara croft ii" that still doesn't make this film good. i once heard that harrison ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money, i'm not sure if that's true or not. what is true is that to get great box office you don't need a great movie or a great actor, this film has neither in its lead roles. my advice to harrison ford would be: to stick to indiana jones because at least you can still run.
