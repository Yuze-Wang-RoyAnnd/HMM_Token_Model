st"ortebeker is truly one of the worst tv mini-series ever made on this planet.<br /><br />the acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense: just two examples: visby was shown as a village of three houses. instead, it was a major city at this time, it's best days already passed by. secondly, hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the baltic sea. hamburg had no access to the baltic sea, the major town at that time was l"ubeck.<br /><br />but worse than all that: the directing! how can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this? impossible! there was not a single believable scene it, the fights were ridiculous and i could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes.<br /><br />i can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent.
