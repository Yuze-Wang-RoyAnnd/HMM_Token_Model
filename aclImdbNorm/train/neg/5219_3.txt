"metamorphosis" hold a tiny bit of cult-value, simply because it was written and directed by george eastman. this italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid joe d'amato production during the late 70's/early 80's. wouldn't it be interesting for avid euro-cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare-butted in "erotic nights of the living dead" all the time? i thought so! now, unlike the movies he starred in, eastman's own "metamorphosis" is kind of disappointing in the gore & sleaze departments. there are a handful of nasty murders, cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies (a guest appearance by sleaze-queen laura gemser!) on display, but it's mainly a talkative movie. the handsome & eloquent dr. houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human dna codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds. he developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process, but if he doesn't come up with detailed reports any time soon, his research will be stopped. so dr. houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins. needless to say (and like the title implies), he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker! in other words, his research sucked! like the other reviewers already mentioned, this movie "borrows" a lot of ideas from david cronenberg's "the fly"
