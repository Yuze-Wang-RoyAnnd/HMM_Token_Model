hated it. if you believe that everyone in the south is dumb, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, a religious nut, or a child molester, then this film may be for you. everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant. in one scene, two older men are talking in a general store and one mentions that he had molested a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes. the man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life. very nice. a teenage girl walks the back roads looking for her sister and no one offers to help her -- despite an obvious limp and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). strathairn's character is not only thoroughly disgusting and slimy, but he is shown to be a religious believer who (typical for hollywood) reflects the vile nature of christians. a scene in the movie is highly reminiscent of the end of cape fear (the one with deniro) -- bible verses being spouted by the bad guy. i am from the great northwest, but found this film offensive because of the wonderful people i know who are from nc, wv, al, ms, ky, tn, etc.
