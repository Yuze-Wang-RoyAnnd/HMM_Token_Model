within the first few minutes of this dutch thriller, we learn that krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a news stand, and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station. and he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up (except for krabbe in at least one scene too many) but has nowhere to go. the basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion. verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism, and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas.
