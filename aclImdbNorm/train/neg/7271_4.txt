this could have been the gay counterpart to gone with the wind given its epic lenght, but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs. the characters are uni-dimensional and have no other development in the story (there's actually no story either) than looking for each other and kissing. it's a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity, and achieving true emotional resonance. on top of that, it pretends to be an "art" film by using the worst naive clich'es of the cinematic snobbery. but anyway, if someone can identify with its heavy banality, i guess that's fine.
