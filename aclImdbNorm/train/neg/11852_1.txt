this movie was supposed to have depicted a 'ladie's man' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all. however, i did not care for his mission to settle down, because i didn't care for his character. i don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him. he had absolutely no class, or charisma. he should've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing, but to no avail. just because he is a musician does not make him sexy. not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. does this man have any shame what-so-ever? had he tidied up, and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring.<br /><br />gina gershon's character was unnecessarily british. she could've just as easily been an uptight out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor british accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie.<br /><br />the only two characters i cared for were the fish and frog. now those two had chemistry! academy nominations for both
