rex reed once said of a movie ("julia and julia" to be specific) that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice. i was reminded of that as i snored through purple butterfly. this one appeared to be shot through gauze.<br /><br />the story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors' faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time. <br /><br />also, everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters. i call this the "dead poets society" syndrome.<br /><br />there was nobody to care about, nobody to become interested in dramatically, and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances.<br /><br />a total disappointment.
