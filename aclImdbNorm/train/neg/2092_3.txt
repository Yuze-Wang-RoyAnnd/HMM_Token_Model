basically, "caprica" is the cylon origin story. the premise of the show is interesting. however, the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many pov characters that it bogs down the storytelling. the plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating what tension it might have had. in any given episode, little or nothing happens.<br /><br />daniel graystone (eric stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. unfortunately, his only working prototype is driven by the ai version of his dead daughter zoe, who died in a suicide bombing caused by soldiers of the one (sto), an underground monotheist extremist group.<br /><br />meanwhile, joseph adama (father of "battlestar galactica"'s commander adama) is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the ai version of his daughter (who also died in the bombing) in a machiavellian virtual version of caprica (which strongly resembles 1930s chicago). <br /><br />in addition to the vapid writing, caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories. we already know how it ends (i.e. the cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
