i feel like i've been had, the con is on, don't fall for it. after reading glowing reviews (the director was a film reviewer with sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews) i expected solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, an intriguing plot development and poetic moments. sadly, 'sixteen years of alcohol', doesn't deliver on the critics promises, for the most part, sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects (what was that clich'ed cobweb scene in there for?), unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration, clich'e edits and camera angles.<br /><br />'sixteen years of alcohol' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in scotland, but it's straight downhill from here. unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters we might care about, or building suspense - the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voice-over's. the lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted - the audience doesn't care what happens to them, desperate actors do desperate things...like this movie!. to make matters worse, the 'homage's' (typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters) are either utterly clich'e or unconvincing. the soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the action.<br /><br />for some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying. i still watched the whole damn thing!<br /><br />i guess i liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter-cut with weird and abstract, sometimes pointless scenes. you don't need a huge budget to make truly moving film, so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film, half a million is not a little bit of money...so no excuses! sometimes i wonder what the actors...or their agents were thinking!<br /><br />pass on this turkey unless you're masochistic or mindless anyway....not my thing<br /><br />1.5/10
