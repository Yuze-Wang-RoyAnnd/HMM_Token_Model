ashley judd, in an early role and i think her first starring role, shows her real-life rebellious nature in this slow-moving feminist soap opera. wow, is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or what?<br /><br />being a staunch feminist in real life, she must have cherished this script. no wonder left wing critic roger ebert loved this movie; it's right up his political alley, too.<br /><br />unlike the reviewers here, i am glad judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained, not preached the heavy-handed liberal agenda.
