minor spoilers!<br /><br />well i just sat up late and watched this film, mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of singleton's earlier work like "boyz n the hood". however, i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived, clich'ed, so-called "message" movies. <br /><br />the acting is mainly poor,(pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors...take note), the situations hard to swallow, (rape victim becomes overnight lesbian?...please!), but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of. by the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation, making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one-dimensional players.<br /><br />not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. as a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems. it's message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion. as for the films conclusion i found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and mildly offensive. for a film called "higher learning" i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again.<br /><br />if you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire "american history x"....unless you were just watching it for tyra banks then go hire a life.
