seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners.<br /><br />although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring. i think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something really new. it's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more 'hip' and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting beyonce perform and letting p. diddy and prince present a category. also letting chris rock be the presenter was an attempt to re-new the ceremony and make it more appealing. none of it really worked out.<br /><br />sure, chris rock is a funny guy but he wasn't really a good presenter. i really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories. his presence wasn't really as 'big' as for instance billy crystal's.<br /><br />also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times. not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird.<br /><br />still, i can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners. none of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case. so does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants? i don't think so. i think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now, with the exception of "million dollar baby" and "the passion of the christ" maybe. sure i don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance caleb deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that i don't like robert richardson's work, he really did some amazing work for most of oliver stone's work but i really feel that deschanel deserved the award way more. also i would had liked seeing jim miller and paul rubell win for best editing and john debney for best music. but oh well, there is no way the academy awards can please everybody of course, i understand that. there will always be people complaining about the winners.<br /><br />it also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners. did prince said any of the nominees names right at once? and were is sean penn's sense of humor? al pacino and jeremy "i hope they missed" irons were the best presenters of the night.<br /><br />overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners.<br /><br />4/10
