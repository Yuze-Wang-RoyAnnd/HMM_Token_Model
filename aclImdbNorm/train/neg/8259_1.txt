i saw this movie way back when it premiered.<br /><br />it was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed-out messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their hands.<br /><br />then suddenly these children, many of whom weren't even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out (they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances), but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard, began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons, sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy, left and right.<br /><br />this whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder, opened it to the child and said 'type the picture you see', then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator, a fold would fall down, revealing another different picture.<br /><br />so while the child may have seen a dog, the moderator saw something like a boat.<br /><br />every time, every bloomin' time, the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed, never what the child was shown.<br /><br />so who was doing the typing? never the child.<br /><br />this movie further took a disastrous turn with, as the australia poster stated, the person who molested the child in the movie was in the situation trying to help the child.<br /><br />had melissa gilbert never put her son in that place, he wouldn't have been molested, is what the movie says. he was better off under her supervision.<br /><br />if i turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead, do you think i'm going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that? not likely! i think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out, that this movie was based on, they never accused someone within their operation as took place here.<br /><br />unfortunately, i do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from gilbert as the mother of an autistic, but other than that, the movie really didn't do much.<br /><br />the worst by far was the child typing at the end to patty duke, and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed, . . . . . "we won!" this child was molested. if you cut my leg off and i take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me, assault, whatever, then that is legal justice, but it doesn't bring my leg back.<br /><br />at best, in my condition, i will view it as a hollow victory.<br /><br />whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation.<br /><br />a 'normal' child has enough to contend with from such an experience.<br /><br />it's utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go 'we won' if that person is found guilty in court.<br /><br />just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here.
