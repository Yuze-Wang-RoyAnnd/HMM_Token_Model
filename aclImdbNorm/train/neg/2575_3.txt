this really doesn't match up to castle of cagliostro. lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. the scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting. <br /><br />the only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by fujiko. it helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. coc had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. the locations in tsotg are not very vivid or engaging. <br /><br />zenigata, goemon and jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. it's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /><br />the dvd is in full-frame with dolby stereo sound. it has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. but one curious thing. there is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.
