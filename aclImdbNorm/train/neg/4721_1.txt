before seeing this movie, please check out reviews available on the internet regarding the movie's falsification of events, particularly its prevarications regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 muslim men were bused out of srebrenica and shot by serbian paramilitaries. the documentarian also belongs to various pro-serbian american organizations. please watch this movie critically, and read reviews beforehand. most reviews argue that the documentarian takes his arguments too far, even if he raises questions that target the conventional wisdom regarding the war. a review in the nytimes by stephen holden states that it would be "inaccurate to label this documentary pro-serbian," but one should question both the presentation of facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, and the omission of those facts that inculpate serbian forces. i do not advise against seeing this documentary, but i do caution you to examine it with an especially critical eye (as one should do at all times anyway).
