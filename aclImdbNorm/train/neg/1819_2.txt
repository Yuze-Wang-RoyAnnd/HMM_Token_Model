i sought out this film for one reason--al adamson. he is among the worst directors of all time--right up there with ed wood, jr. and ray dennis steckler and the pantheon of awfulness. however, i was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad, it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies. because of that, this film wasn't particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fans.<br /><br />now i was wary about watching this film, as the title "naughty stewardesses" makes the film sound like a pornographic film--something i wouldn't be reviewing on imdb. however, this film appeared to be this at times--particularly the first 10 minutes. but, you could tell that the script underwent many changes, as for much of the film there isn't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly not sexy! the result of all this is total confusion.<br /><br />sadly, none of the many parts are even good. for example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little and it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year-old guy in some of the love scenes. sure, for a 71 year-old mr. livingston looked pretty good--but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet! then, when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent, as livingston became a rambo-like guy! talk about weird and inappropriate.<br /><br />overall, there is little to recommend this sad movie. it's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like "naughty stewardesses".
