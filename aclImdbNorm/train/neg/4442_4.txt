i don't'know... maybe it's because i'm brazilian but all that stuff was too much. too much love for the music, too much parties, too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. everything looks too fake to me: the families, the relationships, the music, the "happiness". it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture. i must be honest: it did seduce me a little, but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music, sex and parties? i'm not that stupid: what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea, profound sadness and stds? i liked the scene with caridad's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people.
