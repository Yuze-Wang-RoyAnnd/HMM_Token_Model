take:<br /><br />1. a famous play<br /><br />2. a director with now ideas of his own who is using<br /><br />3. a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1.<br /><br />4. an actor for the lead - who has no feeling for the part he's playing and you'll get: "hamlet, prinz von d"anemark"<br /><br />i listened to the radio play of "hamlet" with maximilian schell as hamlet and i was so disappointed. i hoped that the filmed version would be better, that schell would at least have a body language to underline what he's saying - nothing. then the set... the minimalistic design is not everyone's taste, but usually i like it when there's just enough on the stage to make clear what's the setting and nothing more. alas, that's on a stage, in a theatre. it won't work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings. that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which schell played the hamlet already... let's say if that was the only thing to complain about... i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time. if you've got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on "hamlet", don't watch this one, unless you're a masochist, or really hardcore, or like to poke fun on untalented actors.
