hoo boy, this was a real trial to get through. the dvd case has tom hanks' mug plastered on it and that is the only reason that anybody would buy it. he looks about forty on the box, however, the movie was made in 1982, so he still has his bosom buddies 'do and of course is about forty pounds lighter. the plot concerns a dungeons and dragons like game that hanks and his three friends play and hanks ends up thinking the whole thing is real. chris makepeace is a boy genius named jay jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a succession of funny hats. ooh,look, he has a yellow hardhat on with a tuxedo! now he's dressed like a wwi pilot! this was a truly awful movie but in a bad way. a bunch of vets pop up mostly as parents of the kids. there's anne (i'm honey west, dammit!) francis and louise sorel, who actually looks kind of hot. murray hamilton, the mayor from jaws, has a thankless roll as a cop. wendy crewson, is the love interest for hanks and some blonde guy i have never seen before or since. there is some syrupy music here and there and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement. there is a monster that only hanks can see because he's, you know, nuts. the monster is played by the late, great kevin peter hall, he of predator fame. a friend of mine got this out of the ol' discount bin at mallwart and advised me to chuck it in the trash without even looking at it, so naturally i had to see if it was as bad as all that. it was. the night before, i watched apollo 13, so after that, this movie was a bit of a shock. do yourself a favor and leave it in the bin. oh yeah, after hanks almost jumps from one of the world trade center towers because of his delusions, he goes home to recuperate and is visited by his friends. hanks mother, a drunken vera miles, says he is coming along nicely now but when they walk down to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit, he is crazier than ever. the end
