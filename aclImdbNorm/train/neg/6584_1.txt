being the only movie i was able to see at this year's "nordische filmtage" at l"ubeck, this year's festival will be remembered as a all-time low for me.<br /><br />this movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece of crap! excuse the language, but there aren't any decent words to describe it.<br /><br />first of all, the actors are not the best. but even better actors would not have rescued the movie. e.g. the plot: after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that john was sick, the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. the so called "sex-scene" was nothing else but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn't anything to do with sexuality), but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown. everything else was copied by other directors like e.g. lynch, but of course without their geniality.<br /><br />so, to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money: guy loses girlfriend, girlfriend turns back home, guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards, guy imagines hot, but crazy neighbour girls, guy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in the end he realizes, he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time... bad story, bad actors, pictures, that make you want to vomit...<br /><br />1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact, that you realize how good you can understand norwegian if you learned swedish - at least one benefit of the evening - and you can't choose 0 points here).
