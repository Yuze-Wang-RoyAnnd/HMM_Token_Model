a series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day. not as mind-numbingly awful as say "freddy got fingered" or "lost reality", but that in no way is an endorsement in any way, sense or form. features the worst rhyming clown ever. any most if it isn't offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct. it also has the worst song parody ever put on film, the worst arnold impersonation ever (not just the worst put on film, literally the worst ever). i have no clue why karen black, micheal clarke duncan, or slash would star in this (the reasons i watched this in the first place) the only thing mildly amusing was dickman. in conclusion i would't recommend this film to anyone, but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. do something notable with you lives people. plus if it's true the church of scientalogy hates him, he can't be all bad.<br /><br />my grade: d
