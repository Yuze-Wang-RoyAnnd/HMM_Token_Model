jessica: a ghost story is as the name implies a ghost story. the theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy!<br /><br />a woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead. this constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot. there is really nothing more to it. the movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death.<br /><br />immediately from the opening scenes, this movie has the appearance of a "straight-to-dvd" effort. unlike gems such as vacancy 2, the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives "straight-to-dvd" movies a bad name! the direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense, scares or tension. even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring.<br /><br />the acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career.<br /><br />many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges. i'm not exaggerating!<br /><br />the only reason i give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs. i stress the word "few" in that sentence. this is not overall one of the "so-bad-it's-good" movies like camp blood or the nail gun massacre. if you want to laugh hysterically, watch those movies. if you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch the legend of hell house, the changeling, ringu, the eye (original korean version), the grudge, one missed call or phone.<br /><br />i advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing jessica: a ghost story to keep up the good work! just forget this movie exists. don't spare a thought for it!
