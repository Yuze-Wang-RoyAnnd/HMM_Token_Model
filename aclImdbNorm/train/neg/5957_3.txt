insignificant and low-brained (haha!) 80's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen, yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind. the special effects are tacky, the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs! "the brain" takes place in a typical quiet-american town setting, where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool-kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet. it is here that a tv-guru named dr. blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for nation-wide mind controlling. under the label of "independent thinkers", a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! how cool is that? now, it's up to the meadowvale teen-rebel to save the world! the funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where dr. blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. there are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it. meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? there's not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the "evil" brain looks like an over-sized sock-puppet. the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie. director ed hunt and writer barry pearson are the same men who made "bloody birthday" (guilty pleasure of mine) and "plague". both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry. the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great david gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in re-animator. a girl named christine kossak provides the nudity-factor and she's obviously a great talent
