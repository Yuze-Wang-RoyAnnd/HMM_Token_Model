i really can't believe this movie is not in the imdb worst 250, it is absolutely terrible. when i originally saw it i remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it. we were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible. by the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was. don't be like them, just pass this by. i'm sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie.
