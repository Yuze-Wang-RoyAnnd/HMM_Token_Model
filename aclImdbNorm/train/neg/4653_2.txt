a vampire's's henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar hooker in this extremely low-budget horror-comedy. i can't explain all the positive comments on this movie. i'll chalk it up to mass hallucination, but it's disconcerting none the less. the one redeeming factor (and this is me being extremely generous here) might be the grandfather who's the only semi-likable character in this whole mess. don't waste your money, or time. in fact here's a word of advice, if troma puts it out on dvd, but does not make it themselves, in all likelihood it's crap.<br /><br />troma dvd extras:commentary with omar and kirk; second commentary with cast and crew deleted scenes; bloopers; troma interactivity; radiation march; clip from "terror firmer"; theatrical trailer ;trailers for "the rowdy girls", "teenage catgirls in heat", "cannible: the musical", and "toxic avenger 4" <br /><br />my grade: d
