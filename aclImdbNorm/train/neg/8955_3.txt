as far as the movie goes, it's an ok science fiction movie. it has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes. that said, it's not that good, and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched...<br /><br />as for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete bullsh!t. this is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie... the whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people/androids as part of the "team" behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch...<br /><br />i gave this a 3*** because of the backstabbing of the original. this one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all...<br /><br />watchable for those who have not seen cube & hypercube, but not recommendable for fans of the series...
