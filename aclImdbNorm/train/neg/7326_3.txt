this film has an interesting plot, but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor. i was very disappointed. the moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one, but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered. 2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the film was. i stuck it out to the end, but i must admit i played blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable.
