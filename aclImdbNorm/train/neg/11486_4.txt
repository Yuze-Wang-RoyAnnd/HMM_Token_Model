because some people, like me, like to know everything about a movie even if they plan to see it, including the ending. anyway, here's the ending as i remember it, because i couldn't have been more than 8 yrs old when i saw it for the first and only time on tv. but i'll tell ya, it sure scared the little kid that i was, and i thought about it for days afterward, and it still stands out in my mind to this day, even though some of the details are a little vague. abe vigoda was in this movie? i don't remember that! i didn't even remember that ol' barnabus was in this movie, and i loved dark shadows. so, at the end, the lead character (belinda montgomery?) is lured by the judge (joseph cotton, i'm guessing, even though i remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge; see how memory fades?) to the wedding place, which as i remember it is in a cavern of some kind? maybe i've got that wrong; and shelley winters is there laughing, and the judge has a cape on, and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him, and he throws back the cloak, and he has goat legs, and he announces he's actually her father, the devil, and she's played right into their (the satanic cult's) hands, because the "mortal" guy she has fallen in love with (i guess that's robert foxworth) turns out also to be the guy satan wants to marry her off to, the demon with yellow eyes, and yep, sure enough, they show robert foxworth, and his eyes glow yellow. there are a lot of close-ups in the last few minutes of the film. everyone is laughing and rejoicing, except for belinda montgomery, who is very unhappy, and cries or screams or something, and that's the end. the bad guys win.
