wow! only a movie this ludicrously awful could inspire the similar "showgirls." i mean where to begin? the indescibably horrid theme song? pia zadora's non-expressions throughout the movie? the fact that despite being set in los angeles, aka "land of the casting couch" every single man (and woman!) is fawning all over themselves to sleep with pia zadora, by any contrived means necessary? or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because they're either mind-numbingly stupid (pia) or obvious despicable sleazeball (everyone else)? and given that this flick was written by actual "screenwriters (sorta), it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the movie-making industry (who the hell would admire and kiss up to a screenwriter?)<br /><br />but it's (unintentionally) funny as hell though. the "breakdown" scene alone will have you giggling, and after seeing the climatic "i'm not the only one who had to **** her way to the top" scene at the "awards" (all done in the usual bargain-basement acting level we expect from such quality thespians as pia), i sincerely hope that our dear pia actually reused that speech when she "won" her golden globe. it's fitting and that would totally make my day.<br /><br />anyway, if you're a fan of bad, tashy camp, give this otherwise tacky movie a try.
