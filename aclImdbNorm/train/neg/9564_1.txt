some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen, and i understand where they're coming from, but i really have seen worse.<br /><br />that being said, the movies that i can recall (ie the ones i haven't blocked out) that were worse than this, were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie. the movies that are worse than war games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes, or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness.<br /><br />war games: the dead code isn't that bad, but it comes pretty close. yes i was a fan of the original, but no i wasn't expecting miracles from this one. let's face it the original wasn't really that great of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek-appeal to it.<br /><br />that's all i was hoping for, something bad, but that might have tugged at my geek-strings. was that too much to ask for? is it really not possible to do better than the original war games, even for a straight to video release? well apparently that was too much to ask for. stay away from this movie. at first it's just bad, like "oh yeah, this is bad, but i'm kind of enjoying it, maybe the end will be good like in the original." and then it just gets worse and worse, and by the end, trust me, you will wish you had not seen this movie.
