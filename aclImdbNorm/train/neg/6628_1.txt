if the scale went negative i would be happier. seeing sushmita sen was nice, and nisha kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story. the choice of angles, choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story. oh, if the songs and dances haven't caused you to rip your ears off your head, first. the film could have been made twice at 1.25 hours, and been pretty good, kinda like "seven samurai" but the director and writer didn't go that direction, even if the "townsfolk" finally find their backbone and want to help. this movie fails on so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - name any aspect of this film - it was bad - probably the food from the caterer was bad too. i have never in 6 years of watching indian (bollywood) movies seen something this badly made.
