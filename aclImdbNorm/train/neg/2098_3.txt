i was hoping for some sort of in-depth background information on the apollo 11 mission and what i got was some decent interview material with buzz aldrin gene krantz and other people involved in the mission, linked by over-hyped disaster-predicting sensationalising voice-over in the worst tradition of tv production.<br /><br />if you could cut out the voice-over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could've been great - but i feel i've wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme. i want those minutes back.
