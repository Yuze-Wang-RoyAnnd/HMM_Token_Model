how the hell did they get this made?! presenting itself as a caper comedy, the misbegotten "$" is essentially two hours of people mumbling sentence fragments. the usually dependable warren beatty looks drunk, and the usually hilarious goldie hawn acts like she's on depressants. as for gert frobe, his most famous role - goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. not even the guy with the champagne bottle of lsd can save this litany of worthlessness.<br /><br />am i comparing this movie to "plan 9 from outer space"? i wouldn't do such a thing even if someone paid me. "p9fos" was idiotically made but ended up hilarious; this was idiotically made and causes you to feel like your brain just melted out of your ears. warren beatty and goldie hawn made up for this when they co-starred in "shampoo", but then they co-starred in the dreadful "town & country". maybe they just shouldn't co-star in movies. all in all, i would rather have my skin torn off than have to watch this again. awful.<br /><br />maybe they should remake it with jackie chan. then i would pay to see it.
