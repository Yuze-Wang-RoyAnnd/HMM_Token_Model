sweet sixteen (1983) **/***** 86 minutes director jim sotos cast bo hopkins, susan strasberg, aleisa shirley, patrick macnee, dana kimmell<br /><br />fifteen year old bad girl melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. the detective has to put together the clues with the help of his nancy drew good girl daughter played by friday the 13th alumni dana kimmell. the local native americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. these events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />this below average slasher isn't too memorable. it has a made for tv feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. lines like "the killer will turn us into coleslaw." fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. marci calls melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. apparently marci sees how hard it is to fit in because melissa knows how to wear make-up. this movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. the social commentary on indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. i am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. both sweet sixteen and ed hunt's bloody birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but i feel failed to deliver. but on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on dvd gives hope that others will follow.
