i tried to finish this film three times, but it's god awful. case in point: mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast,mom stops for gas, crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the b&b try to rape her. she escapes, heads to b&b and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops, story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts. wow.<br /><br />other action logic deficits abound. acting is also lukewarm, and the next door neighbor's warning is delivered in a really corny, badly acted moment.<br /><br />moments of intense gore/death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time-filler interplay between characters.<br /><br />less focus on gore, more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated.
