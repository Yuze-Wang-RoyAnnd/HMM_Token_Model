as a premise, this backwoods version of the dead calm storyline had promise.<br /><br />however, director eric red's inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors.<br /><br />ultimately, the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline. intermittent spates of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly distracting.<br /><br />charles dance, doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does his best to save the movie. but ultimately, undertow squeals like a pig ... and has more ham to boot.
