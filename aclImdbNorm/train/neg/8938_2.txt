i still can't believe how bad this movie was. if i wasn't a massochist i don't know if i would have survived the viewing. it looks like it cost about $1000 to make, but it wasn't the money that brought them down. the acting was horrid - not just bad, 3rd graders could have read the lines better. second, the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin, and that is sorely lacking in this flick. we don't even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff. <br /><br />ahh well, better luck next time eh?
