cybil richards directs another full moon/surrender cinema masterpiece of erotica. this time jacqualine lovell (dressed in rather fetching silver outfit) is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity. however she can't resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them. the sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack (at least for this sort of film). the cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too. jacqueline lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below. she also fits in a little lesbian activity. to be honest lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare. here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the 'drama'. utterly rubbish movie with lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features. mediocre even for surrender's output and clearly a new budget low for them also.
