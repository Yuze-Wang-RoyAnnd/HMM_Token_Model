imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see, and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about "the grudge." so, in good faith, you recommend seeing that movie. it is the halloween season, after all. and it did boffo box office this past weekend, so it must be pretty good...so you go.<br /><br />and you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does, and you hear yourself audibly saying, "that can't be the end of the movie...." but, alas, it is. <br /><br />and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie. you think that your date thinks you're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity, and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship. actually, it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was. i see no future for miss gellar in the movies, and suggest that she sticks to television in the future. actually, it won't be long before she is consigned to flea-market conventions selling buffy memorabilia, and it can't happen soon enough, if you ask me. horrible, horrible, horrible. the plot didn't make sense; continuity was terrible. it's apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a "grudge ii--the return of 'cat-boy'."
