"a stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as 'the fiend' targets them for death. a pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of 'the fiend' and find themselves targets as well. just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved, you're thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />taking "the hunchback of notre dame" to hollywood, producer sam katzman's lack of studio settings probably helps "a face in the fog" look interesting, especially toward the end (1930s traffic). the direction could be improved upon; for example, the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful. the budget appears slight. under the circumstances, most of the silent/talkie crossover cast perform it amiably.<br /><br />**** a face in the fog (2/1/36) robert f. hill ~ lloyd hughes, june collyer, al st. john
