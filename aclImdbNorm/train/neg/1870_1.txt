i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters, but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap. if you look at promotional pictures/posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging/kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime. this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap. when i watch it i feel like i'm watching a police version of coronation street or something similar. i have to say i still like the bill as i'm interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have. i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over.<br /><br />as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill, most of the great characters are gone now (although a few still remain i think) and i'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't, its just that they lack the tough looks, personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble.<br /><br />overall being one of the only police programs on television these days, the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch, but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness (if thats the right spelling) and would now be classed as a terrible, unreal television soap.<br /><br />recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10
