i usually enjoy films like this. it's shot documentary style, but the acting and writing are just awful. the acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is just so clich'e, but not at all in a good way. as of typing this, i'm surprised it's at a 5.2/10 on imdb. i'm certain that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the movie. i suppose if that's the case, you might manage a couple of laughs, as it's always funny seeing your relatives/friends make a movie. well, in a way, i guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers, directors, actors, etc., 'cause if they can do it, you can do it. although, maybe you shouldn't.
