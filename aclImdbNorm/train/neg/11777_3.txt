years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the acting memorable and the storyline a classic. recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part 1 again i looked eagerly to viewing part 2...... i was so pleased to realize early on into part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie, again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii ........ wrong!, i wish i'd stopped at ii. the storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. pacino's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather 1 or 2. then scenes such as, corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir, the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset, the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting (where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and guile isn't ready for an emergency?)... no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again. but i'll watch 1 & 2 many times down the years.
