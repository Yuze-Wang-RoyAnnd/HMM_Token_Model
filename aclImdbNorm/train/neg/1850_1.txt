director ron atkins is certifiably insane. this ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one harry russo (john giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a nut-job who receives a rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend. he starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. what starts off as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film, well stays like that, but it gets very repetitive very fast. i'm leaning more toward the certifiably insane. it is hard to forget once seen though. kinda like if tom green ever did a horror film.<br /><br />my grade:f <br /><br />eye candy: laurie farwell gets fully nude; jasmin putnam shows tits and bush <br /><br />anti-eye candy: seeing john completely naked repeatedly
