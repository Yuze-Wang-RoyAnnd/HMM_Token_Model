i saw this movie last year in media class and i have to say i really hated it. i was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have has something to do with it. but for english this year, year 11, we had to read animal farm, also by george orwell. aside from the fact that the book is based on the revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and i also hated it.<br /><br />but 1984, i think it was the most disturbing movie i have ever seen, and i think that george orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet. i'm sorry to everyone who loved his work, but i unfortunately did not. the themes in the movie were well portrayed, but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards. this is only my opinion, and i'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film.
