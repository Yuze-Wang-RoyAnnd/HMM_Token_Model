"show me your boobies!" is not funny, and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where i'm coming from. i don't want my 6 and 7 years old daughters thinking like that or hearing that. i find it sad that nick hyped this crap that much and then that's what we get, stupid little kids acting like stupid adults. i know it's meant to be humorous but consider we out there that have sweet little innocent girls in k and 1st grade who can't wait to see this. i had to comment on how disappointed i was when i saw it. my daughters won't be watching it. i'd love to block nick but don't have the heart at this point but if nick keeps putting out this kind of crap i'll have to.
