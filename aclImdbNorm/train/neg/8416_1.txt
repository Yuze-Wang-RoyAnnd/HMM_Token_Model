it makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from hollywood because oftentimes in hollywood it's all just a popularity contest. it also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content. yet, this film is overrated and overblown. eddie murphy looks just ridiculous. no way do jeniffer hudson and beyonce knowles give the oscar rated performance so many have raved over before the film was even out. i can't even believe that condon is being set up to be nominated for a directing oscar when all he did was put together an album. glitz does not replace a nothing storyline. a bunch of songs does not a movie make.
