this movie could have been so much better, especially considering the talent. larenz tate's portrayal of frankie lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. he doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are larenz tate, when he should have been frankie lymon. the portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has hollywood written all over it. the powers that be obviously pushed it, but it only made the characters more unrealistic. the positives of the movie were miguel nunez's portrayal of little richard, and the cameo of little richard himself. lela rochon is eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. it's too bad that the talents of halle berry and vivica a. fox were wasted. the whole frankie lymon saga was fascinating in real life. too bad this film was a wasted opportunity.
