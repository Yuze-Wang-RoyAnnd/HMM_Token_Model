from the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the fiend. it's all tiresome, slow moving, unimaginative drivel. it was ok seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around. visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time, but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this. i just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic. and then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned. perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone's pants pocket.
