in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and "king arthur", on dvds chosen by others for an evening's "entertainment" and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination, and is content as long as they get "action". both movies were utter rubbish.<br /><br />whatever happened to character development? whatever happened to meaningful dialogue? whatever happened to acting? and, when watching something that vaguely purports to be "historical", whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy, some realistic idea of the "political map" of the time, even some slight flavour of the era, especially in its social attitudes. why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america? i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that "little was known" of the dark ages. not so. considerable amounts are known, with much learned scholarship on the era, but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do any homework.<br /><br />i only wish i could vote 0/10
