this is a truly awful "b" movie. it is witless and often embarrassing. the plot, the basic "making into show business" routine, is almost nonexistent. in fact, the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942, including the mills brothers, count basie, duke ellington, bob crosby, and freddy slack. each group gets about the standard three minutes, the exception being the mills brothers, who for some reason warranted two numbers. ann miller doesn't get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film, and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propaganda.<br /><br />the most interesting moment in the film, in my view, occurred in the duke ellington segment. the band appears to be playing in a train, standing in awkward positions. (in the deep south at the time, the band was segregated in railroad cars when traveling.) johnny hodges is seen next to duke, and harry carney may also be identified. in the last moments of the film, trumpeter/violinist ray nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and does an "uncle tom," bugging his eyes and wiggling his head the way willy best did in many films. for modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this homage to segregation is sad indeed. some movies go best unseen.
