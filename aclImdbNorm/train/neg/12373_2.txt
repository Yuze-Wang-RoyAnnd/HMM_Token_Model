the script is so so laughable... this in turn, makes the actors' lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed. there's repetition of phrases -- "my sweet little god daughter" and minor variations of that line which comes to mind... and it's just sloppy soap opera dialog.<br /><br />worse yet, the music is so wrong! plus, the main bluesy "theme" is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this. and it feels overused mostly because the instrumentation, texture and arrangement of this theme never changes, even when the scene's emotional context does.<br /><br />subsequently, whenever it appears, it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another.<br /><br />the music's corny, and it's as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom -- a low budget 80's canadian sitcom at that -- and this makes it feel as if we're always on the brink of throwing to a commercial.<br /><br />this is so miscast, there's a lot of overacting and it's a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only one type of ny accent -- a thick bronx accent. i don't know if it's a question of the actors' limited capacity in only knowing *one* ny accent -- or whether it's a question of the director's ability to notice such an glaring anomaly.<br /><br />in the end, it's the amateur script with it's leaden lines which makes this entire "movie"... blow. when any foundation is shaky and unstable, it's impossible to build upon it without it's flaws revealing themselves in exponentially more damaging and unflattering ways.
