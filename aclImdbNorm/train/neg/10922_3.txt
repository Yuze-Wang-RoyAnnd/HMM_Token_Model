worse than the rating it has been given. this is a typical scifi movie nowadays: bad to awful acting, a script that is poorly written, and shoddy direction. from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end, this movie is terrible. in the beginning scenes this movie has moses (which was charlton heston in the demille film), pharoah (yul brynner) and nefretiri (anne baxtor) overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand. the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to "supposedly" be. the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance. the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality.
