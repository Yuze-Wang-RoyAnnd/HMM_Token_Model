this movie is a 90 minute ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. what kind of high school is this anyway?<br /><br />unless you are a major ramones fan, do not and i repeat do not waste your time like i did. this is utterly unwatchable from start to finish. this movie should be called ramone fever. everyone appears to like them in this movie. there is not a plot to be found in this flick. as far as teen comedies go, you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.
