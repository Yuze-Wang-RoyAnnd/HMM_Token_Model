spoiler!! i love branagh, love helena bonham-carter, loved them together in "mary shelley's frankenstein" - but this -<br /><br />i can understand an actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. well, they did, but really - the script droned on, bonham-carter's clothes were tres chic, and the occasional speeded-up "madcap" sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles' movie, or the old rowan and martin laugh-in.<br /><br />i never got the point - other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer. i never felt that. he was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not endearing. the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch. certainly not amusing.<br /><br />bonham-carter's realistic (one supposes) attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of lancashire accent in "full monty."<br /><br />the poetic ending, with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated. was there a choir of angels, or merely a soundtrack?<br /><br />go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it. donate this to pbs.<br /><br />
