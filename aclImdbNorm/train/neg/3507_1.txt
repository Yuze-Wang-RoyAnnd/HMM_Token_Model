a low point in human interaction was reached by the maysles brothers with this film. do remember, you who used words like "masterpiece"when reviewing this film, that these maysles creeps didn't just happen to drive to the hamptons and happen to shoot film on some eccentric people. no, when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to finance their project (and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project). then they befriended the two extremely vulnerable women. no meeting of minds here or real consensual participation. these wretched maysles smiled, kissed ass, did whatever they had to to get the beales to cooperate and then exploited them as viciously as has ever been done. one would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. but the film-making process, given the preplanning, actual shooting and then editing took a lot of time and their goal had no provisions for actually relating to the beales as human beings. an exploitation film perpetrated by the vilest of people. as time accrued their film-making reputation has been seriously stained by what they did here. their reputation as human beings is execrable. that is what people will remember them as. grotesque hustlers.
