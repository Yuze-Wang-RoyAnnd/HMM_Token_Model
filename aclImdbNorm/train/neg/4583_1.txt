if you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential, watch "waking life," which is brilliant. "what the #$*! do we know" is all over the place in its focus, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly acted, utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying. it wasn't thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. the inclusion of that rambling freak "ramtha" in this film is reason enough to avoid it. isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old atlantian god or something? what a flake that old chick is, and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. the people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again.
