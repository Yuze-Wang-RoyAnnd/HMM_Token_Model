i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival. sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin. being a devout fan of lewis carroll's 'alice' books i was very excited about this movie's premier, which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch. normally i'm enthusiastic about modern re-tellings if they are treated well. usually it's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story. unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion. the adaptation of the original's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying. it probably didn't help that the actors weren't very good either. most performances were ridiculously over the top, which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script. i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film. all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by. really, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfman's work. also, i'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance-off was awful. it was with out a doubt the low point of the film.<br /><br />what a joke. don't see this movie. after its conclusion i was genuinely angry.
