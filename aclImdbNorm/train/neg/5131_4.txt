i liked it but then i think i might have been ironing at the same time. this reworking of cyrano de bergerac/roxanne is an utterly undemanding, formulaic romcom rescued from straight-to-video ignominy on its release by the sharp turn of janeane garofalo. playing the frasier of pets, she finds herself caught in a love trap when insecurity leads her to pass her best friend (uma thurman) off as herself when a caller comes a-courtin'.<br /><br />this is an interesting film in the fascinating career of ben chaplin. an average british actor, he gave the hollywood treadmill a shot with this film. he is unremarkable and his anonymity in studio productions is unsurprising on the basis of it, although he has appeared in substantial cameos in both the later terence malick films. uma thurman does a ditzy turn on autopilot and michael lehmann packages it all together competently. icky phone sex though. 4/10
