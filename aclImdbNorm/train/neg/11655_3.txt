i was very disappointed by this movie. i thought that "scary movie" although not a great movie was very good and funny. "scary movie 2" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid.<br /><br />the exorcist/amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. james woods was great.<br /><br />now, i'll admit that i am at a disadvantage since i have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where i had basically seen them all. but bad comedy is still bad comedy.<br /><br />something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. scenes and jokes drag out way to long.<br /><br />also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. for example, the talking bird. ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. but it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. the routine between the wheelchair guy and hanson (chris elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.<br /><br />some jokes even got repeated from the first movie. for example, the 'creaming' i guess you would call it of cindy (anna faris) was funny in "scary movie" because cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her. but this time around it was out of place and not funny.<br /><br />the bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around. the scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.<br /><br />tori spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.<br /><br />but i did enjoy shorty (marlon wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. the scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i love the wayans family and their humor. that is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.
