strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but overall this felt like crashing a wake. campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire. there were just too many semi-boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage. i love the clash and joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now (fu mick jones), but this doc left me wanting..to relate more. using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent. they should have been interviewed on their own. even using strummer's 'radio dj voice' did little to glue the film together. and can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes? after the awesome "filth and the fury" i hoped temple could deliver. a joe strummer doc deserves better.
