okay, first off, seagal's voice is dubbed over for like 50% of the film... why? because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions. from the very beginning, you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting, but they make no sense.<br /><br />that said, the story still sucked and doesn't make any sense at all. when i got the the end, i was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn't even make sense.<br /><br />avoid like the plague. this movie made me stop watching seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse.
