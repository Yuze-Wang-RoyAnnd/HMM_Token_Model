he only gets third billing (behind arthur treacher & virginia field), but this was effectively david niven's first starring role and he's charmingly silly as p. g. wodehouse's dunderheaded bertie wooster, master (in name only) to jeeves, that most unflappable of valets. as an adaptation, it's more like a watered-down the 39 steps than a true wodehousian outing. and that's too bad since the interplay between treacher & niven isn't too far off the mark. alas, the 'b' movie mystery tropes & forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes. next year's follow-up (step lively, jeeves) was even more off the mark, with no bertie in sight and jeeves (of all people!) forced to play the goof.
