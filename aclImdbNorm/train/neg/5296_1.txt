i'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation, this one is really lame. even on a nudity-and-gore level, it's incredibly boring (there is some of both, but it's all sort of...meh). before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all, *plan 9 from outer space* played in theaters). there is precisely one good (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; i assume they stole it from somewhere.<br /><br />the acting is among the worst i have ever seen. i mean, even ed wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy, which can be fun to watch. anyway, most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate. here, those who don't read their lines like cigar-store indians sound like they learned them phonetically. and this film does have one distinction: it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie, then laughably overplotted for the ending.<br /><br />(update: i should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. she is by no means wooden. not that she's good, but she certainly isn't wooden.)<br /><br />even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness, but with this one, there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about.<br /><br />and you know the funniest thing? they clearly expected to make a sequel!<br /><br />it's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. i sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it.
