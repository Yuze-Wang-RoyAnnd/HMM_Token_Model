it's been nearly 30 years, and i still hate everyone involved in this movie. it remains the worst movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />before seeing this, i never much minded rivers, one way or the other. after seeing this movie, i have an allergic reaction when i accidentally see her on television.<br /><br />i got dragged to this - against my better judgment - by peer pressure. however, coming out of the theater, those friends swore an oath to never again overrule my choice of movie. nearly thirty years later, we still carry around mental scars from this movie.<br /><br />on my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time i wasted hoping that this movie might get better. it never did.<br /><br />if you are ever given a choice, you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie.<br /><br />i registered for imdb comments just in the hope that perhaps i can warn others against viewing this movie. if i can save just one person from watching this, then my existence on this earth will have been justified.
