movie about a small town with equal numbers of mormons and baptists. new family moves in, cue the overwritten dialog, mediocre acting, green jello salad with shredded carrots, and every other 'inside mormon joke' known to man. anyone outside the mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie. anyone inside the mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there. you'll be much better off watching hess's other movies (napoleon dynamite, etc..) than trying to sit through this one. the acting is mediocre. jared hess has had his hands on much more quality films like "saints and soldiers", and "napoleon dynamite". i would recommend both movies over this groaner.
