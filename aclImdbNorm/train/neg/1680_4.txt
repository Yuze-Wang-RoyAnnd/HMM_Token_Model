even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as val kilmer and lisa kudrow, wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film. it barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that july night in 1981. kilmer just goes through the motions as john holmes and kudrow and kate bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles; as holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. the rest of the cast has such small roles that it's impossible to get any dimensions from them. the film also stars carrie fisher, ted levine, franky g, mc gainey, dylan mcdermott and a cameo from paris hilton.
