i vaguely remember ben from my sci-fi fandom days of the '60s, i was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses, most notably ben, actress fay spain, and jody fair, who played angela in 1961's the young savages. ben was one of the people at a low-key sci-fi con in chicago, about 1970, when i had a nice chat with him and his "career" and life. all these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day. wish i still had copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later. ben was a really nice fellow, ekeing out a living (the cons of those days didn't even pay their guest, unless, of course they were big-name stars, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars, at most! good to know ben's still alive & kicking! how 'bout a remake of creature, but 50 years older! ugly then, uglier now!
