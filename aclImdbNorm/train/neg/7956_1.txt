this movie should be number one on the bottom 100. the acting is so horrible that when my son and i watched it we nearly got physically ill. and the story is worse. i could go on and on about how bad it is but all i really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob's review as i see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet. don't waste your time, money, energy or anything else on this movie. thank goodness we saw it on tv so we didn't spend anything on it. had we, i would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to hurl an execration in their general direction. in conclusion, i would like to say that i have always enjoyed watching carrie fisher act. but i am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film. don't spoil your opinion of carrie by viewing it.
