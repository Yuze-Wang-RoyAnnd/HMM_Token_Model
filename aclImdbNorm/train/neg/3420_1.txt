i saw this movie the first time at about twelve o'clock on a saturday evening. it really is the perfect time for this one. i have never, ever seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes. if you want to see a thrilling action movie, don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through. however, if you want a good laugh, please watch it! i even bought the chuck norris 3dvd collection thanks to my enjoyable saturday night. what especially struck me is that 'every scene that would be expensive to make was copy-pasted from a discovery documentary or an old tv-special on the us army. furthermore i was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real. afghanistan is, as far as i can remember, nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click deke escapes from the terrorists sand-castle with his jet-pack and is taken away by a submarine (probably discovery). later on in the movie, deke throws an islam terrorist against the wall. in the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall. gotta love it. i recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though, only then you'll understand why i've been mad enough to spend 6,99 euro's on the box.
