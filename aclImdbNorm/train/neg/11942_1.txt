absolutely one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time! it starts off badly and just deteriorates. katherine heigl is woefully miscast in a lolita role and leo grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character. the only cast-member with any enthusiasm is tom sizemore, who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role. the script is dire, the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through! it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen! katherine heigl's character is completely unsympathetic. she's seen as an evil, wanton seductress who lures the poor, innocent married man to cheat on his wife. it is implied throughout the movie that she's underage, and the message that accompanies that plot-strand just beggars belief! at the end, she isn't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who's obviously (ha!) become demented with rage and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere. horrible. don't waste your time.
