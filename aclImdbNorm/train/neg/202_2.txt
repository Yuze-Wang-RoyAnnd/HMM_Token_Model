that's not the sound of bees, that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly acted movie. how i ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep i'll never know. the plot is simple...3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. and you thought rohmer was deadly. this is even worse, if that's possible. > i must really be a masochist if i could watch this entire movie without turning it off...or killing someone.
