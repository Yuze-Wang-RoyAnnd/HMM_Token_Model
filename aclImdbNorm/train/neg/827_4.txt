blazing saddles! it's a fight between two estranged brothers (dennis quaid and arliss howard), both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences, with dippy love-interest debra winger caught in the middle. director glenn gordon caron (the tv whiz-kid behind "moonlighting") smothers the darkly-textured comedy in vince gilligan's screenplay with a presentation so slick, the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant. it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature, but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities. these aren't even characters, they're plot functions. barely-released to theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good. winger is the only stand-out in a cast which looks truly perplexed. *1/2 from ****
