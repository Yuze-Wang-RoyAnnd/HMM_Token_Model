this is one of the worst films i've seen in years!! you could randomly pluck 5 people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film. absolute waste of time watching it. i only gave it a 2 as i like gory films but this is just plain rubbish. the acting (and i use that term very loosely) is abysmal, someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film?? don't waste your time watching this. hostel was a better film by some way. i cannot believe that someone has spent money making this, i hope for the producers sake it only cost $50,000 to make - it looks like a school project, made by kids who haven't got a clue. did this even make it to the cinema??
