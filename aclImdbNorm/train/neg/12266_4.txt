republic pictures comes late in the game to the "werewolf" er werecat genre. the plot has a writer returning to paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts. he is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller. the french government wants to know if he had access to secret documents, something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a "catman". suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc'e ends up dead. complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not.<br /><br />okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed. there are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections. the acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people i know only remember the top hatted killer, he's the most interesting thing in this film. despite its short running time (just over an hour) i think the reason that this film was rarely seen on tv was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it. as good as the talk is, i just wished someone would do something. when it finally did happen, in the closing minutes, it was too little too late..<br /><br />take a pass.
