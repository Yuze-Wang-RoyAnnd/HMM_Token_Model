some gorehound-friends recommended "live feed" to me, and basically i can't really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze, but it is of course not a very good film. more than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema, the so-called torture porn, ryan nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre (and that includes the role models "hostel" and "saw") with its sick & twisted make-up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked co-eds tried up, suffering and begging for their lives. there's no actual plot to describe. five utterly brainless twenty-something friends take a trip to asia. one of them has asian roots, but other than that i don't really know why they opted to travel there instead of to cancun. they're clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market. the quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan. a simply apology clearly doesn't suffice, as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture. one girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat; yikes. "live feed" is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook, even if you're used to watching independent fan-boy trash cinema like this. the fat bloke depicted on the cover, an oriental s&m executioner, is admittedly quite cool and he's also the most talented of the whole bunch, because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time. i wouldn't exactly recommend this pile of filth, but hey, if you like loud & hideous metal music, nauseating torture footage and dim-witted losers, go right ahead and watch!
