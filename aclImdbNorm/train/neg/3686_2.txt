i am surprised that everyone (even the critics) seems to think this was a good movie. it was the most clich'ed thriller ever made that i have seen. we have the 'bad guy' who wants to force the 'good guy' (or girls in this case) to do something or face the consequence. the 'good girl' in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the 'bad guy' and save the day and her loved ones. using charisma, bravery, and even luck to save the day. <br /><br />where to begin? well, a young woman by the name of lisa reisert meets a young man by the name of jackson rippner (nice name) at an airport. one coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate is bringing these two together. sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, seemingly getting along in every way... is there more to this strangeness? could these two be meant for each other? does 'fate' have a reason for their strange and random encounter? <br /><br />well, as it turns out, unfortunately yes. jackson needs to lisa to help him assassinate the director of homeland security by moving him from one room to another so that his men can launch an attack on him. oh, if she doesn't do this then her father is dead. though we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness, jackson more then explains how this is going to happen and why its in lisa's best interest to help him.<br /><br />of course, lisa defeats his evil plans with her smarts and in the process stabs him in the neck, makes him trip over chairs, and hitting him with a field hockey stick. oh, and before that, she leads him on wild chase through miami airport where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car that she later uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill her father. <br /><br />yeah, right.<br /><br />first of all, i find it strange that a man like jackson who can get his hands on high tech weaponry needs the help of a hotel manager. couldn't he just sneak a bomb into the building? wouldn't that make it safer for him and his team by leaving out any third parties? and why do characters like jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they are threatening? doesn't that make it easier to stop them by the same people? <br /><br />the actors did their best considering the movie they were given. racheal mcadams and cillian murphy are still actors to look out for. also, i believe that jayma mays (who played the 'loveable' cynthia) will be someone we will see more of. it's just too bad they all were stuck with this.<br /><br />2 out of 10
