it wasn't the most pointless animation film experience ever, but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good. combining dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later named spirit (matt damon, providing the first person narration), and his journey through across the frontiers of the old west. basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he manages to throw off all who try to ride him. however when he escapes his cage, along with little creek (daniel studi), the two of them form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has a thing for little creek's female horse. in the end, after a few more escapes, being chased by the colonel (james cromwell) and his men, and making a final big leap across a gorge, little creek lets spirit go, and he also releases his female horse, and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses. also starring chopper bernet as sgt. adams, jeff lebeau as murphy/railroad foreman, john rubano as soldier, richard mcgonagle as bill and matthew levin as joe. i was expecting to see the horses talk in this film, but it turns out to be more like a dumbo thing throughout, and the songs by bryan adams aren't the most engaging, but it isn't a terrible film. it was nominated the oscar for best animated feature, and it was nominated the golden globe for best song for bryan adams' "here i am". okay!
