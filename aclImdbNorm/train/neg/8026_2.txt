it makes one wonder how this show is still on the air. there's been one couple that has stayed together, married, and has children, but everyone else has broken up. what's the point of continuing this? the show can be entertaining at the beginning. you see all the girls swooning over one man, that almost all of them like instantly. it's just like in real life! the girls start to take sides, bitch one another out, and show their true selves (or so we think). but that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after.<br /><br />what is true love exactly? how can you fall for someone when you're forced to pick them? this show is unbelievable. you thought dating online was bad, but people have to go on tv to find love? it's not realistic. how could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others, making out with them? none of these questions are answered, and finally when the show ends, you know there won't be a happy ending in the future. for all we know, everything is scripted.
