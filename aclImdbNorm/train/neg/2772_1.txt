warning spoiler. . . i have to agree with you, it was almost there. this was such a bad movie, about such and interesting true story. it had such promise, but the acting was ridiculous at best. some sets were beautiful and realistic. others are something out of a theme park. i found myself laughing as i watched, what was suppose to be, serious scenes. i really wanted to like this movie, but i couldn't. the best part was the fight between friends that ended with the "king" dying. i liked the queens' punishment. and, the final shot made a beautiful picture, though. there are so many better movies to watch. i don't recommend this.
