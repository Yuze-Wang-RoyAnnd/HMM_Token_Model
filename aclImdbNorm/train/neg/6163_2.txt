hooper is not funny, not fasted paced, not romantic and non informative. there is no real drama. you would think that a movie about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama, there was an attempt but it didn't seem real. no character study, no lessons learned, it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun, they were just trying to act like they were having fun. there is no reason to watch unless you like to look at burt and want get an occasional glimpse of sally. prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. in fact prancer was the best actor in this movie. smoky and the bandit was such a fun movie that i was ready to like hooper. this movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time
