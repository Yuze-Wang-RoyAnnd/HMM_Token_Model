this is the worst documentary to come out of canada ever!!!! i'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie. all they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote. they keep changing the script to suite the person they're pitching. i could not get out of the theatre fast enough when i saw it at that year's toronto film festival. please never see this film.
