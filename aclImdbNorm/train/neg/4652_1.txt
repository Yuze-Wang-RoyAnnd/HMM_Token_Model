this was a painful example of a cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced by australian tv stations to fulfil local content quotas. the writing was truly terrible and i'm not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst australian film in recent memory the honerable wally norman.<br /><br />nothing about this tv series was funny - ever - not even mildly amusing. it was just tired and bad and, worst of all, it really thought it was funny. it was simply embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />there is something very suss about this show being given 10 out of 10 on imdb. try to find a (real) review by a (real) australian viewer of the show (there weren't many) and it is impossible. or crazy. there are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show. <br /><br />avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on dvd, remember that the laughter that deserves was unintentional.
