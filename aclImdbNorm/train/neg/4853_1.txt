i'm a huge fan of war movies, and, as a vietnam combat vet, have some experience with the technical details. i worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them. other vets, and iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well. poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and fails badly because of it. no bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives. the opening scene particularly annoyed me. the guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. yelling, "stop dialing" is not an effective deterrent. it got worse from there. the scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious. as others have noted, your average eod guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper, and to think any arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. kidnapping an arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen. somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to the movies. i could go on, but, as i said, others have pointed these things out in detail. this is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards at all, it's a further reflection of why "la la land" is so named.
