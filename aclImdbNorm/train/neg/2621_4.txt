i wouldn't bring a child under 8 to see this. with puppies dangling off of buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to cruella's scary laugh to name a few of the events there is entirely too much suspense for a small child. <br /><br />the live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disquieting moments including some guy that seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will worry and may frighten small kids.<br /><br />i don't know what the disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level. the puppies are cute but this movie is spotty at best.
