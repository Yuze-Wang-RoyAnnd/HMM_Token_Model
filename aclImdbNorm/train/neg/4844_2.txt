i am definitely in the minority opinion on this one. "the hurt locker" has won more "best picture" awards from the critic groups than any other film this year. however, not only did i not like it, i found it hard to sit through.<br /><br />there is minimal plot and little character development. they disarm bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs. that is the entire movie. <br /><br />but the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking. this has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap, documentary look to it. the camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen.<br /><br />i normally don't care for war movies and "the hurt locker" was no exception. but you don't need to take my word for it because the critics love it.
