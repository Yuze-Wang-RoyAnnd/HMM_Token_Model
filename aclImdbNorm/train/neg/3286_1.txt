i don't understand why making remakes has become the trend. every remake i have ever seen is awful, and this is no exception. if any of you have seen the quote from ben jones, that it is a "sleazy" piece of trash, he is quite right. why they would take a wonderful television show, which i loved, have never missed an episode, and own seasons 1-4 on dvd, and ruin it, i'll never know. the television show was a family show, and although daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, save the outfits. a family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage, and i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. another thing i didn't like was that john schneider and tom wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also extremely cute. the new bo and luke are not even a little cute. that was one of the drawers for the show. the casting is terrible. they could have at least gotten a brunette for daisy. i don't think burt reynolds is a qualified boss hogg, either. every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role. the only role they cast halfway decent is willie nelson as uncle jesse, but still it is no comparison. denver pyle is an actor all his own, and that made him perfect for the role. i think that the casting is awful, the story is awful, and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, terrible movie. i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. i only saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket in season 4 dvd. i would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free. don't pay to see this movie.
