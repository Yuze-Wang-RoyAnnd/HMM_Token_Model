i saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf. and before i got my first vcr i figured i'd christen it with this little gem and it's bad film-making at it's finest!<br /><br />the dialog is inadvertently hilarious. and it contains a cameo with donald trump. anthony quinn is in it inexplicably. and much like christopher walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years. this movie is mr. quinn's country bears.<br /><br />it features lines like, "shut up and let me fight!!!"<br /><br />and "you're saying a lot of sh_it!" <br /><br />and the priceless comeback: "unfortunately it is sh_it, tough angry sh_it!"<br /><br />you'll be awed by a fight scene as bo does a sommersault across a billiard table! and does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll! chop socky action and t and a thrills!!!<br /><br />what schlock movie fan could ask for more? oh, and when mr. quinn's character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness? he says, "real men don't eat quiche."<br /><br />uh, aaa, yeah. if bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there!
