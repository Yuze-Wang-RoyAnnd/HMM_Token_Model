i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty, and i can honestly say i feel violated. i had read the reviews and heard the warnings, and i thought i was prepared for anything - at best i thought, a faithful (if misguided) attempt at an original adaptation; at worst, a so-good-it's-bad "plan 9" for the new millennium. so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk, i joked to my friends "prepare for the worst movie ever made!" oh, cruel karma. there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film. the "special" effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx81. the acting is terrible, the accents are worse than terrible (one artillery mans' accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles, from scotland to wales via northern ireland), the dialogue is stilted, the editing is non-existent, the production values prove that no expense has been gone to. words really cannot describe how bad this movie is; from the union flag flying from the horribly cgi'd thunderchild (the royal navy flies the white ensign, not the union flag) to the woodworm ridden acting, this is quite simply a crime against film making. when you consider some of the literally-zero-budget fan films that are available on the 'net (the star wars short "troops" for example), the whole "we're enthusiastic amateurs" argument goes right out of the window. and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website, this film had an 8 figure budget! i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us. maybe the problem is that hines & co tried to make a film of the book, rather than turn the book into a film (if that makes any sense). characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words. ironically enough, the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers, the ex-soft porn actress. my advice? pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesn't screw up, and go watch the spielberg version. it may not be true to the text of the book, but i can say this; as a lifelong hg wells fan (and englishman as well) speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book. maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country, but i will say this: timothy hines stole three hours of my life, and i want them back.
