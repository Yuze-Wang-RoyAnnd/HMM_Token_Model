what the bleep do we know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe. we are presented with a parade of apparent experts (none of whom are named) who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner. their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal mini-plots.<br /><br />the film pilfers themes from science, philosophy, theology and politics, minces them together without any regard for accuracy, and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions. we are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult to answer question the film-makers would like to point their finger at.<br /><br />it is riddled errors and logical non-sequiturs. how did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? it's like saying 'two plus two equals four, therefore i can move objects with my mind'.<br /><br />there is nothing original in this film, and almost nothing that is accurate. any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavy-handed editing, intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance. educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on.
