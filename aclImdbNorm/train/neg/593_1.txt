this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen. worse than the most abhorrent american dross; worse than glitter - mariah carey in american dross par excellence. i can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea. it's not. it is abject rubbish from very bowels of satan himself (who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it). robert jones as exce producer, spending our tax payers money (lottery money folks) on this piece of nonsense, should be accountable. who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make deathline??? i ask you - camp as a christmas tree, deathline ... 'mind the doors' is classic of really bad british film, we really don't need a reminder. and we certainly don't need a poor, second rate, badly scripted, badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this. all this this from the uk funding agency that brought us sex lives of the potato men... i rest my case.<br /><br />do not pay any money to see this. it is absolute and utter crap - the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash... our cash... for making it. they should hang their heads in shame.<br /><br />i am staggered at the low, low standard of this film. it makes me mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting. there is no hope for the british film industry whilst idiots are running the show. harvey wienstein where are you? come back, we forgive you!!!
