remember when harrison ford was the biggest star in hollywood because he made great movies? those days are feeling like a more and more distant memory.<br /><br />while "hollywood homicide" is by no means terrible, it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie. it's a comedy that's not particularly funny, and an action movie that's not especially exciting. an overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline.<br /><br />ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects, and he is able to carry the film most of the time. hartnett is adequate, but he and ford aren't exactly newman and redford as far as chemistry is concerned.<br /><br />all in all, "hollywood homicide" is a reasonably amusing diversion, but just barely. take out ford, and it's not even that.
