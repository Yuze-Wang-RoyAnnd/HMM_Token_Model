wait, don't tell me... they threw out the movie and kept the out takes. you know, this movie could have been shot in a back alley in new york. the "gangster bangster" i guess. gangster rap, designer gangster duster clothes including the kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust storms to the head. i guess it was to protect the head from the heat filtering through the k-mart hats. "budget rent-a-horsie", it seems, supplied the horsies. the one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was mouthing her words.... i though it was him talking. you know, watching this movie just confirms that, it isn't about the acting anymore... its about looks and it's about the money. couldn't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned. well, all in all, i think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made. just one more thing though, where was ice t? did he finally get to go on oprah?
