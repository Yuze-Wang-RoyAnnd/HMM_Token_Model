ok this movie had a terrible premise. be serious according to the movie they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet they have money to buy huge robots and pit them against each other. each country decides instead of investing into rebuilding their country they would rather fight with robots no one could afford. here's a better idea, lets rely on our most inept resource,jocks, to fight our battles. <br /><br />everyone says what about the director, what about him. he makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. there is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director, maybe he was asleep? i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because it was so cheesy and ridiculous i had to laugh. i actually had a good time watching it, well except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin(trust me no one would see this guy as an assassin, so it is a surprise, however lame) what kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway. i was sad to see mst3k had not done this one. i am giving a two star rating however because nothing could be as bad as "manos the hands of fate."<br /><br />the budget does not matter either, i have seen plenty of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube. the storyline was not even plausible and i have seen better acting in school plays. surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school play.<br /><br />anyway pick it up, it is a fun movie to watch.
