this move reminded my of tales from the crypt keeper. it has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve. i think that's always the them in a crypt story. the same goes for the bad acting. very bad acting. i enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didn't like it and i wasn't expecting much. whenever i watch a stephen king movie i don't expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels. i have read the shining and carrie and they were great books. i love how carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such. it was so good. but i noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies. the endings were very different then the movie versions. i assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy. i ending of thinner is the worst. so cheesy. i want to read the book to find out the real ending. i suggest everyone who intends to read stephen king's novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare. and that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book. i intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies. i'm sure if they were made into movies they were real good books... and the screenplay went terribly wrong.
