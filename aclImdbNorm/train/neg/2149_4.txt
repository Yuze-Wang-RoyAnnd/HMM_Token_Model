well, the big money machine has done it again! disney very shrewdly takes advantage of morons like myself who feel we must own every video (good or bad) stamped with the disney moniker. why is it that i continue to look forward to these "sequels" which make don bluth on a bad day look like leonardo davinci? cinderella 2 consists of three storylines (already a poor choice!) doesn't one of the most endearing disney creations at least deserve a linear story? of these three, only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that i would expect. the music is atrocious and modern (meaning in 2 years it will already be dated) and adds nothing to the story. why does everything have to be updated? you know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style? gee, i can't wait for a sequel to sleeping beauty. instead of music based on the themes of tchaikovsky, we'll get music inspired by britney spears!!! so disney, if you're listening, remember we're not all indiscriminate children out here. how about throwing a bone or two to the fans who've been around long enough to know the difference between craft and crap?
