i guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music? <br /><br />is the cartoonish acting of howard desilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children? <br /><br />is william daniels' campy contemporary (for the time) acting style meant to appeal to a 1960s/70s demographic? <br /><br />do we need all the "in-jokes" about ny & nj? (i can hear the blue-haired broadway audience guffawing on cue.) <br /><br />sorry, i find the whole piece dated, boring & the acting far too strident for the screen
