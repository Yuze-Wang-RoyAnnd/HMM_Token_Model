i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr. well yes, if you exclude the dwarfs, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the classy direction and everything else. which leaves you with the walking. and boy, does this film do walking! if mr piano had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. you've never seen so much walking in a movie. if this really had a $20m budget, most of it must have gone on mr piano's shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. which explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes. even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg walk.<br /><br />as for the sci-fi stuff, i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film: they only get in the way of the walking, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story.<br /><br />i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs?
