after seeing the 1996 remake, i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. the whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. but there was actually no need for a second one. first of all, if cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. just make her break away from jail and that's a rap. i thought it was not very funny. it's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. i'd expected that it should be lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having roger and anita back too. however, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only three puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). gerard depardieu's part was pointless. at the end, cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. she gets baked inside a giant cake. that was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. that just didn't work. it was too much over the top, and not too funny. i actually felt sorry about cruella.
