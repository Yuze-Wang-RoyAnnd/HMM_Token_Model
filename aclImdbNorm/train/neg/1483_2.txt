i only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. a group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes ands wrong turn. only problem is, unless i miscounted, there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that impressive. sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. some gory but silly deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. the ending is predictable and has been done to death. no pun intended.
