i saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it reared it's head like a reindeer with rabies every november-december as a saturday matin'ee kiddie show.it was always stiff competition for the chrstmas that almost wasn't (oops-can i say "christmas"?), perhaps the greatest,most iconic christmas-season film of all time.but that's another review.<br /><br />at the time,i marveled that the on-screen tint of santa claus was almost "pink and white", so much had the color of the sprocket-torn prints changed color.<br /><br />the film is kinda creepy! i thought so then--and still do, actually. i was highly entertained then, as i still am! it's amusing in a "retarted-elf" sort of way. by the way,the image quality looks much better on the dvd i have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74.<br /><br />if you are expecting maybe "the lost rankin-bass christmas special-forget it! if you want fellini does christmas--read on...<br /><br />by nature, the dubbing on these foreign films (the original version here was in spanish)always makes them seem "surreal". this adds to the films inherent oddness. it is also pretty scary in that a "mishevious demon" (as described in the original us trailer) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids "evil". one particularly nightmarish scene has a young "latch-key" boy wishing he had parents for christmas-suddenly the "port-a-family" emerges out of giant "christmas presents-of-the-mind" until he realizes he's just daydreaming! see this,christmas lovers--and if you're a stoner, save your stash--this film will make you think you're hallucinating...without drugs!
