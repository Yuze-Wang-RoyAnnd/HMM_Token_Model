i'm not sure what. i just couldn't laugh at it. i had an open mind. i didn't want to be a tight-@ss about it. but i seriously just couldn't laugh at this film. it was just not funny to me. some parts it seemed like ben stiller and jack black tried too hard. just because you put two very funny men together doesn't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy. some movies just shouldn't be made. this is one of them. because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid. i know, i know it's a comedy. sort of at least. but i was just not impressed. i'm sorry, but i cannot give this anything lower than a two. and that's all i'm giving. <br /><br />2/10
