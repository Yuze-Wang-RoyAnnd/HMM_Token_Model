i thought it was a new-york located movie: wrong! it's a little british countryside setting.<br /><br />i thought it was a comedy: wrong! it's a drama.... well, up to the last third, because after the story becomes totally "abracadabrantesque", the symbolic word for a french presidential mandate. it means, close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling.<br /><br />what do i have left? maybe, a good duo of actress: yes, i know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me. the tall doctoress surprises by her punch, and mcdowell delivers a fine acting as usual, all in delicate, soft and almost mute attitude. this gentleness puzzles me, because as other fine artists or directors, the same pattern is repeating over and over. in her case, it's like, whatever the movie, it's always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, who lives infinite different stories. i still don't know how to set the limit (or the fusion) between the artists and the works.<br /><br />another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch & the interesting different points of view. the women have each their own way of living, even if they are all single. it brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people.<br /><br />finally, the movie is quite viewable, but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision.
