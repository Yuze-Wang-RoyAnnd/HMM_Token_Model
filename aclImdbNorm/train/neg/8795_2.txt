i saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie. the only thing i did see was quentin tarantino's seeming insane obsession for it... there were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality. overall however, i found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous. the hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks i found clumsy and dizzying, even sickening. overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the u.s. military against various malcontents.<br /><br />the various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and "conclusions." a depressing movie (not a true _film_, a term i reserve for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a "romantic comedy" though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content, form, and conclusion any association with this genre.<br /><br />i suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of imdb and other ratings sources.
