needless remake, and it can't come close to capturing the charm of the original. the extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts. this version is ridiculously politically correct. the film lacks style, and mostly it lacks talent, not just with the acting, but the direction, sets, costumes etc. are all below par. it has a blatant disregard for period detail. vanessa williams is the only cast member that shows any flair, tyne daly isn't too bad. they should have left well enough alone. the singing ranges good (vanessa williams) to poor (everyone else). watch the original 1963 version and skip this one. there is not much here to recommend.
