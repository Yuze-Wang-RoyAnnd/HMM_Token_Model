this is not an all-around terrible comedy, but it is very dull. it has barely any laughs, and it wastes its lavish production values. there is one poignant moment near the end, when fu manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his "nemesis" and tells him that "you've been my one worthy adversary; and now we can start all over again". that scene, however, along with burt kwouk's amusing cameo in the beginning, are the only memorable parts of the movie.
