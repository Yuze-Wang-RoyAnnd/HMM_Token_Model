i saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it. i've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. personally, i enjoyed the first story (too bad that wasn't extended.) the second story, i thought, was cliched. and that "california dreaming," if i hear that one more time... chungking express is alright, but it's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see, like "crouching tiger."
