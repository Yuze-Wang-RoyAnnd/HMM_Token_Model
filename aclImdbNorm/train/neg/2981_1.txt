this movie was recently released on dvd in the us and i finally got the chance to see this hard-to-find gem. it even came with original theatrical previews of other italian horror classics like "spasmo" and "beyond the darkness". unfortunately, the previews were the best thing about this movie.<br /><br />"zombi 3" in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous lucio fulci "zombie" franchise which began in 1979. similarly compared to "zombie", "zombi 3" consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this 'horror' trash barely afloat. the gore is nearly non-existent (unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces) and the english dubbing is a notch below embarrassing.<br /><br />the plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists (ie. an idiotic male and his stupid female side-kick) who are developing some sort of chemical called "death one" that is supposed to re-animate the dead. unless my ears need to be checked, i don't even recall a reason for the research of "death one". it seems to exist only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star' in this cinematic laugh-fest.<br /><br />anyway, "death one" is experimented on a corpse (whom i swear looked like yul brynner), and after it is injected into his system, he sits upright and his head explodes! the sound effects are also quite hilarious - as the corpse's face bubbles with green slime, the sound of 'paper crumpling' can be heard. the "death one" toxin is transported outside and is 'hi-jacked' by a group of thieves where one makes off with it, but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial.<br /><br />needless to say, the guy turns into a zombie, but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel, infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror(!). the military catch wind of this and immediately take action before 'eliminating' everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the 'contamination zone' and turn the motel upside down. they find the infected thief and burn his body, only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack(!).<br /><br />we cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army, listening to 'groovy music' that is coming out of a little dinky boom-box while trailing a trailer-load of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests. can someone say "zombie food"? we also have a sub-plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road... the same birds that were infected by the 'zombie' smoke! <br /><br />the birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water. this is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie. she walks around this old dirty, rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud, "hello? is there anyone here? please, i just need some water!" she encounters a group of zombies, one of which is chained to a wall (!) and the other is swinging a machete. after a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground, she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter.<br /><br />meanwhile, the birds attack the trailer-load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected. they all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place, and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place. after a matter of hours (a day at the most), the same motel is now caked in dust, has vines growing throughout it, and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years. anyway, what better place to take refuge than this particular building? needless to say, the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack.<br /><br />the third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village, of which the woman comments, "this place is a dump!" she then proceeds to get 'pushed' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna(?) infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds! meanwhile, her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected hours earlier is still turning into a zombie!<br /><br />unfortunately, there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words. for example, the time rate concerning infected people being 'zombified' differs greatly. sometimes it takes seconds, other times it takes hours. some zombies run, others drag their feet and walk really slow. some even do kung-fu moves, while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people. some of the zombies even talk! the funniest moment of course is the infamous 'zombie head in the fridge' gag which 'elevates' itself in mid-air and 'attacks' a stupid man who goes looking for food. funnily enough, his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it's 'headless' counter-part (lmao!).<br /><br />the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story-lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies. we never get to see them come back as zombies, in fact the only ones we do see 'zombified' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off. other than that, i was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and/or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies. it is also amazing that these zombies only take a 'few bites' and then move on to their next victim. <br /><br />the most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus. a pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital. a woman who seems to have a lot of 'medical knowledge' tries to deliver the baby (!) and has her face pulled off by a zombie, before having her head pushed into the woman's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off. timeless!<br /><br />as usual, all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. the megalomaniacal military officer, the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed, the obvious characters who are about to get killed (ie. watch for the man chasing a chicken!) i guess this movie really is a comedy. there were many laughable scenes, such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade (obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent) and a climatic scene where a man screams, "i'm thirsty.... thirsty for your blood!". the costumes are really bad - the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film, wearing the same 'asian-like' clothing that may be found in a bruce lee film, and watch out for the blue 60's skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man.<br /><br />the end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story-line. a radio dj who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the 'beginning of the end' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. hardly "dawn of the dead" material if you ask me.<br /><br />regardless, this movie does deliver many laughs. the gore is minimal, and what gore there is, it is very unconvincing, let alone unimaginative. the usual mix of black blood, thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and 'zombie make-up' consisting of green moss. "zombi 3" makes for a good rental for a sleep-over party or a night of beer and popcorn. other than that, horror fans should stay away.<br /><br />3 out of 10
