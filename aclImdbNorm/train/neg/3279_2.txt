oh geez... there are so many other films i want to see out there... i got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted - yeah...<br /><br />i used to watch this show when i was in college...it was mindless, kinda fun, and somewhat action-oriented. the show had a good heart tho...and the characters were cute; no one ever got killed or even hurt badly... it was like a cartoon come to life. cut to 2005...what happened? this one doesn't work. as others have said, there simply isn't a cohesive story and the performances are weird...almost annoying - definitely not faithful to the original characters...the whole thing is a like a mad tv skit and it lasts over 100 minutes! this was one of the few times i've been embarrassed watching a film. what were they thinking? as best i can tell, must've been for the product marketing, toys, etc. all i can say is, let this one die a quick death. it makes the original dukes of hazzard seem like masterpiece theater...<br /><br />i think the only remake left to do from tv is gilligan's island... good luck!
