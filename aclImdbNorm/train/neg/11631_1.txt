today, i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood.<br /><br />hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. it changed our perception of security. it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. most importantly and devastatingly , it changed our world.<br /><br />however, i can't not stress how utterly repulsed, disillusioned, and angry i am at the careless, blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word-of-mouth among moviegoers and critics alike; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. hollywood has sunk to a new low. even lower than the low-down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. behind it all is uwe boll. i am very angry at this movie. how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world?!?!?! how...dare...they? <br /><br />to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty, i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: remember. think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. think back to that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones. think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes. think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks.<br /><br />ask yourself if you have a soul.<br /><br />think. remember. respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all.
